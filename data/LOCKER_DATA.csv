A relaxing routine will rest your mind and heart rate so that when you finally go to bed you won’t lie awake trying and failing to sleep. The one or two hours before bed should be your time for activities to prepare yourself for sleep. Here’s a list of soothing activities to try when you’re winding down for the night.",4/13/22

9. Create a pre-bed yoga routine
A gentle activity such as yoga can calm your mind and heart rate as you prepare for bed. One survey found that most adults reported improved sleep after practicing yoga and 85% said it reduces stress. Try relaxing positions such as child pose, reclined butterfly, or simply sitting cross-legged on the floor (or your bed) in the easy pose and breathing for five minutes to activate the parasympathetic nervous system.
### 10. Music, white or pink noise
10. Music, white or pink noise
A sound machine for white or pink noise frequencies that generate a steady background hum can drown out noises that may keep you awake or jolt you out of sleep. Turn on the sound machine as part of your nightly routine to teach your brain that these sounds mean its bedtime.
### 11. Journal
11. Journal
Writing in a diary the old-fashioned way lets you organize your mind, decrease overthinking and worry, and allows you to fall asleep faster. If you’re prone to staying awake with anxiety, organizing your thoughts on paper may help calm you enough to be able to rest. You can also use journaling to write about positive experiences to redirect your mind as you prepare for sleep.

13-tips-to-create-a-nightly-routine-to-sleep-better,13 Tips to Create a Nightly Routine to Sleep Better,"7. Separate work from bed
7. Separate work from bed
The ability to work from anywhere means you can also work at any time. Working remotely often means you have less separation between home and the office, and potentially less separation between work and sleep. This was an issue during the coronavirus pandemic when people who were used to going into work suddenly had to work from home. Nearly one-third of American employees worked remotely during the pandemic, and about 40% of Americans polled reported new sleeping problems in this study.
Avoid working in your bedroom if possible. Maintaining a separate space for sleep lets you mentally associate your bedroom with relaxation and sleep. Additionally, try to stick to a schedule. You are in your work area for a specific time that is separated by at least a couple of hours from bedtime. This gives you a chance to have work, family and wind-down times, and spaces that encroach less on each other.
### 8. Create tech-free time
8. Create tech-free time
Plan some technology-free time before you go to bed. Blue lights from most televisions, computers, and phones inhibit the production of melatonin. It also affects your circadian rhythm, which is one reason blue light and sunlight wake you up in the morning. Some electronics have settings that alter screen temperatures to a warmer color in the evening, but electronics can have other negative effects. Social media can create feelings of anxiety and depression, emotions you don’t necessarily want to feel when you’re trying to sleep.",4/13/22
13-tips-to-create-a-nightly-routine-to-sleep-better,13 Tips to Create a Nightly Routine to Sleep Better,"13. Add in supplements like magnesium or melatonin
13. Add in supplements like magnesium or melatonin
Magnesium can help your body relax by inhibiting the sympathetic branch of your autonomic nervous system. Magnesium deficiencies have been connected to sleep disorders and poor sleep. If you’re not getting enough of it in your diet a magnesium supplement may aid your sleep. WHOOP members average 15 more minutes of sleep per night when they use magnesium, and 2% more REM sleep. They also average an 8% higher recovery the next morning.
Magnesium has a positive effect on time spent asleep, amount of REM sleep, and next day’s recovery.
Melatonin is a widely used sleep supplement. It’s produced naturally in the pineal gland and aids the regulation of your sleep cycle and circadian rhythm. Your melatonin levels are linked to the amount of light around you. Melatonin alerts your systems that it’s time to go to sleep by binding with receptors in your body and brain and telling them to relax. WHOOP members report 34 more minutes of sleep each night when they take melatonin and 2% more REM sleep. They also wake with an 11% higher recovery.
Melatonin does not put you to sleep, but taking the supplement does have a positive impact on your sleep.",4/13/22
13-tips-to-create-a-nightly-routine-to-sleep-better,13 Tips to Create a Nightly Routine to Sleep Better,"4. Have a hot beverage
4. Have a hot beverage
Warm milk is a traditional bedtime routine in some cultures. It may be that the sleep-inducing compounds that milk contains, such as tryptophan, can promote sleep. Tryptophan is an amino acid found in proteins (such as turkey) and plays a role in the production of serotonin, which boosts mood, promotes relaxation, and functions as a precursor in the production of melatonin.
If you don’t like milk, or you’re on a plant-based diet, you can try chamomile tea, which in addition to reducing anxiety and depression may also boost your immune system. Chamomile tea contains apigenin, an antioxidant that binds to receptors in your brain that can promote sleepiness and reduce insomnia.
### 5. Avoid caffeine
5. Avoid caffeine
Coffee drinkers should stay away from consuming it in the afternoon. Some people are so sensitive to caffeine that they should stop before noon. You can experiment by stopping earlier than normal and track how it affects your sleep in the WHOOP Journal.
### 6. Avoid alcohol
6. Avoid alcohol
We’ve said it before. Alcohol may make you feel sleepy, but it is detrimental to a good night’s sleep. Sleep is an active process and alcohol inhibits those processes. Alcohol prevents you from getting enough REM sleep and deep sleep as your body metabolizes it.
Alcohol has a significant effect on the quality of your resting heart rate while you sleep.

### 1. Make it a routine and set your bedtime
1. Make it a routine and set your bedtime
Having a regular bedtime is just as important for adults as it is for children. Set your bedtime, whether it’s 9 pm or 1 am and stick to it. A consistent sleep schedule can get you more and better quality rest and may lower your risk for heart disease. Additionally, a set bedtime will ensure you’re getting enough sleep. Adults generally need 7-9 hours of sleep each night, but the amount you need is highly individualized. WHOOP members average 7:30 hours of sleep for every 8 hours in bed.
### 2. Reduce snacking
2. Reduce snacking
Eating some simple carbs after dinner may help you fall asleep faster and sleep better. Foods like potatoes, toast with peanut butter, low-fat cheese and crackers, almonds, bananas, or yogurt are easy to digest and may be sleep inducing. Avoid sugary or high-fat foods (sorry, no ice cream). Some spicy foods are also difficult to digest and may cause you to wake up throughout the night.
### 3. Stop eating early
3. Stop eating early
Speaking of snacking, avoid eating 2-3 hours before bedtime. Beyond eating early, sticking to a regular dinner time regulates your circadian rhythm and improves your sleep efficiency. When WHOOP members report eating close to bedtime, they get 26 fewer minutes of sleep than they usually do. They also average 3% less REM sleep than normal. Additionally, their next-day recovery dips by 10% following late-night snacking.
Eating within an hour or two of going to bed can affect your time spent asleep, amount of REM sleep, and next day’s recovery.",4/13/22

Learn which pre-bed activities work best for you by tracking your wind-down routine with the WHOOP Journal. Each morning you can log nightly activities in the Journal and start to monitor how well they work for you.

30-murphs-workout-heart-rate-data,30 Murphs in 30 Days: What I Saw in My WHOOP Data,"Analyzing the Data
Statistically speaking, the best I could show would be correlation, not causation (by Pearson R–higher correlation is a value closest to 1.0). Let’s look at the graphs…
First, we have the basics. My Murph times are in blue and red dashes represent a moving 3-day average. To help visualize a direct correlation with Murph times, rounds are graphed as 25 (the most rounds I ever broke it up into) divided by the number of rounds I did each day (labeled as 25/rounds, more on this to come).
You can see that my overall average times went down as merely repeating the workout, over and over again, improved my fitness. On Day 1, it took me 43:08 (20 rounds of 5–10–15) to complete. Later, on Day 25, it took just 33:13 doing it the same way (20 rounds), and my best was on Day 27 (31:57, 25 rounds). Interestingly, on Day 30, the time was similar to Day 1 (43:08 vs 43:01), but I did it with strict pull-ups on that last day (again, the difference between strict and kipping pull-ups is quite substantial).
The relationship between Murph time and rounds showed a moderate-high inverse correlation, so the more rounds the workout was broken down into the better/faster the finishing time (correlation coefficient, R = -0.59).
When adding HRV/RHR/sleep duration into the equation, individually, they were not strongly correlated. Nor was there a strong relationship using multiple regression (r² = 0.09, r² indicates the proportion of variation in the dependent variable that can be attributed to the independent variable), which accounts for multiple x variables and their effect on y (Murph time).",10/9/20
30-murphs-workout-heart-rate-data,30 Murphs in 30 Days: What I Saw in My WHOOP Data,"Tracking Fitness Gains Over the 30 Days
In order to key in on a physiologic response (an improvement in fitness), I decided to look at the percentage of time in each HR zone in Day 1-15 vs Day 16-30, and then compare these numbers to the Murph times. As you can see, my average Murph time improved in the second half, from 45:57 to 41:24. Additionally, the time in the 80-90% of max HR went down from 55.1% to 47.6%, while time in the 70-80% range went up from 34.8% to 45.6%.
What this means is that for a fixed output (the “work,” Murph, was a constant), the myocardial oxygen demand was less in the second half of the month, corresponding to less of a compensatory HR response (less time at higher HR even though I was working harder and finishing the workouts faster).
This was really cool to see–a quantifiable improvement in fitness. It also may help give a good target HR to optimize Murph times (and possibly other workouts) in the future.
## Final Stats for the 30 Days
Here are the overall stats from my 30 days and 30 Murphs:
3000 pull-ups
6000 push-ups
9000 air squats
60 miles ran
Total time: 21 hours and 50 minutes
Average time: 43:40
Fastest time: 31:57 (20 rounds, every 45 seconds)
Slowest time: 68:47 (in work boots and jean shorts, a really bad idea)
Subjectively worst workout: Strict unpartitioned on air runner (54:34)
Favorite way to partition: 25 rounds of 4–8–12 (not as bad on the legs as 5–10–15)",10/9/20
30-murphs-workout-heart-rate-data,30 Murphs in 30 Days: What I Saw in My WHOOP Data,"Doing 30 Murphs in 30 Days
At first, I didn’t broadcast it too much. I wanted to see how my body would hold up (especially my hands doing 100 weighted pull-ups every day). I’ve had some bad experiences with ripping up my hands in the past, and if you’ve done that before you know that doing additional pull-ups with ripped hands is no fun at all.
After about 5 days and no ripped hands (grips helped), I felt a lot more confident about finishing the task. In fact, the pull-ups and push-ups actually got a lot easier as I progressed. It was the air squats – all 300 of them – that were the worst (very monotonous).
In order to prevent boredom (at least as much as you can while repeating the same workout for 30 days straight) I often mixed up the scheme. I tried it with strict pull-ups (way harder than kipping), and even used the air runner instead of outdoor running (which was also much worse, by the way, and felt uphill at times).
Around Day 2 or 3 I started to become curious as to what measurable variables might affect my times–and that is where WHOOP came in.",10/9/20
30-murphs-workout-heart-rate-data,30 Murphs in 30 Days: What I Saw in My WHOOP Data,"More Sleep and Recovery Stats
Some additional numbers worth pointing out:
Average recovery: 60%
Worst recovery: 24% (Day 17)
Best recovery: 96% (Day 14, all metrics were well above baseline, including an HRV of 94!)
Most sleep: 11:25 (Day 18, definitely related to the marathon row on Day 17, keep reading…)
Least sleep: 3:46 (Day 15, coached CrossFit before work that day)
## WHOOP strain and other notable things…
Again, not the smartest idea but on Day 17 a buddy of mine and I did a marathon row. I hit Murph in the AM, recovered for a bit, and then at 1 pm we rowed 42,195 meters (26.2 miles). It took us 3 hours and 35 minutes. It’s safe to say my WHOOP strain (a measure of cardiovascular exertion) was particularly high that day, 18.3 on a scale of 0-21. Notice the strain from workouts (in blue in the chart below) on April 4, which is that’s why I slept 11+ hours that night.
What did I do when I finished?
I wanted to take that vest off. Obviously after each workout, but also after the 30 days. I wanted to see how it felt to do a Murph unvested. So on Day 31, I did it one more time. Without a vest, in 26:47. The runs were 6:15-ish and 6:40-ish and I tried to hold 20 rounds of 5–10–15 every 40–45 seconds (I couldn’t keep 40 all the way though, which was only about 10 seconds of rest after each round). Oh also, earlier that morning on Day 31, I took up NFL fullback Dan Vitale on a pushup challenge: 10 push-ups every 30 seconds for an hour (1200 push-ups in 60 min), but that’s another story…
No surprise, it hurt really bad, the entire time.",10/9/20
30-murphs-workout-heart-rate-data,30 Murphs in 30 Days: What I Saw in My WHOOP Data,"The Need for WHOOP
I’ve been a WHOOP member since 2017, and am quite familiar with the physiologic metrics it provides (I’m even using it for scientific research to help prevent burnout in medical residents).
Early on, it was quite clear that the way I constructed the workout was a big determinant of my final times. The more rounds I broke it up into, the faster I finished. Which, of course, makes sense–the less cumulative muscle fatigue, the harder you can push, the faster you go.
But, I wanted to take my analysis further. I decided to see if I could essentially develop a model using some of my WHOOP recovery metrics (heart rate variability, resting heart rate (RHR), sleep duration) to predict my Murph times. Some of the other predetermined covariates that I wanted to try to account for included various ways of partitioning (number of rounds), max heart rate, average HR and time spent in each heart rate zone, and the refractory time between each workout.
Let me pause for a quick note on heart rate variability (HRV). It is the variation in time between beats of your heart and represents the balance between your sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system (fight or flight vs. rest and digest). HRV signifies how capable the body is to adapt, or in this case, take on stress or strain. This plays a big role in quantifying the recovery in an athlete, and so I hypothesized that it might have a correlation with Murph times.",10/9/20
30-murphs-workout-heart-rate-data,30 Murphs in 30 Days: What I Saw in My WHOOP Data,"When the COVID-19 pandemic hit back in March, I decided to channel all the craziness going on in the world and challenge myself to do something I probably shouldn’t have: Completing the workout ‘Murph’ every day for 30 days.
Why?
I wanted to see if I could do it. It’s a pretty brutal workout to even just perform once (usually taking 45 minutes to an hour to complete), and sometimes it takes the body several days to recover. But I felt it would be a good physical and mental challenge, so I just went for it.
Below is an explanation of my thought process before, during, and afterwards. I also describe how I couldn’t have done it without WHOOP, with some in-depth analysis of my data.
## What is ‘Murph’?
I first did ‘Murph’ in May of 2015 (as it generally programmed at CrossFit gyms nationwide on Memorial Day Weekend), and have done it every year since then. The workout is in memory of Lt. Michael Murphy, a United States Navy SEAL who was killed in Afghanistan in 2005.
It was his favorite workout, and consists of the following:
a 1-mile run
100 pullups
200 push-ups
300 air squats
another 1-mile run
All while wearing a 20-pound vest or body armor.
It can be done unpartitioned (straight through, as written above) or you can break up the 100-200-300 part (for example, 20 rounds of 5 pullups, 10 push-ups, 15 air squats).
I had previously done a few “30-day run challenges” (running a set mile amount every day for 30 days) during internal medicine residency, but I wanted to push the envelope a bit more. I settled on Murph, as it checked the running box (2-miles, with a vest) but more importantly, it was a legitimate challenge that I didn’t know if I could do.
And I loved that. So, I decided to give it a shot. What’s the worst that could happen… I fail?",10/9/20

RHR dropped from 57 to 52
Sleep duration went from 5:21 to 6:33
This is also a good indicator of fitness gains from the start to finish of the 30 days. It’s likely a cumulative effect from all the cardiovascular exercise (running with a vest is a killer workout) and dialing in the nutrition to fuel my body for this endeavor.
What is even more interesting is comparing these numbers to my baseline over 21 months of residency. My HRV 30-day average is now 78, compared to a previous baseline of 62 +/- 9 (1.67 standard deviations better), and my RHR is 52 compared to a baseline of 57 +/- 2.5 (a full 2 standard deviations better). The 30 consecutive days of repeating a pretty strenuous workout were clearly enough to cause a measurable improvement in markers of fitness and performance.",10/9/20
30-murphs-workout-heart-rate-data,30 Murphs in 30 Days: What I Saw in My WHOOP Data,"Quantifying Effort with Heart Rate Zones
Given that ‘effort’ seemed to be a factor to be unaccounted for, I wondered if maybe there was a way to quantify it. I looked at the average HR and max HR, and how they related to each time. Maybe the harder I pushed (effort) would be captured by one or both of these values? There was a decent correlation (inverse) between average HR and time (R = -0.50).
The addition of max HR with average HR showed a mild-moderate fit based on multivariate regression (time vs max HR/average HR), r² 0.25. Average HRs were generally in the 150s-160s (high of 167) and max HRs were in the 180s most days, with local maxima of 195 and 193. Most of the workouts showed an upward trend of HR throughout the workout, which was nearly maxed out on the final mile. Below is a screenshot of my HR data from one workout (Note the spikes in the middle, corresponding to each individual round).
## Using HR Zones as a Guide to Optimize Murph Time
Next, I was interested in objectively quantifying a physiologic adaptation to repeating the same workout for 30 days. To do this, I used the time spent in each HR zone (<50%, 50-60%, 60-70%, 70-80%, 80-90%, and 90-100%). A first pass through the data showed that time spent in the 60-70% and 80-90% zones were the strongest independent predictors of workout time (R = 0.6 and R = 0.47, respectively).
My interpretation here is that it was beneficial to my Murph times to stay in a submaximal HR zone as long as possible (80-90%), and minimize time spent in the lower HR zone (60-70%), while not ‘burning out’ or pushing too hard and elevating into the highest HR zone (90-100%).
Optimizing HR zone time was a key determinant of improving my Murph times. This is quite valuable insight and I will strive to stay in this optimal HR zone for workouts like this in my training moving forward.",10/9/20
30-murphs-workout-heart-rate-data,30 Murphs in 30 Days: What I Saw in My WHOOP Data,"Final Takeaways
Circling back to the data, the more rounds you use to break up the work, the more your muscles recover and the less they fatigue, so the faster you go. And the harder you work, the higher your HR is during a workout, the faster/better your time is.
I do believe (not to sound cliché) that this is the future. Using objective data is always preferred over subjective data, and I think we have a lot more to learn about how to best use and implement these metrics to improve our daily lives.
So what can you do with all this information?
If you plan on doing Murph next Memorial Day, or any day in between, the data is pretty compelling to support doing it in 20 rounds of 5–10–15, or (my favorite) 25 rounds of 4–8–12. I recommend trying to keep an EMOM (every minute on the minute) pace.
Continuous aerobic capacity work makes you fitter–not really a groundbreaking conclusion, but this is objective data that shows the physiologic adaptation.
Also, regarding HRV in particular, even though it wasn’t a strong predictor here it is important to realize that even my worst HRVs during the 30 Murphs were still above my baseline (all but 3 days, actually). I think this clouded the analysis.
If you want a fast time, don’t do it in boots and jorts.
In summary, I did 30 Murphs in 30 days. I learned a lot–about myself, mental fortitude, physiologic adaptations, and I even brushed up on some statistics along the way. It was a ton of fun. On my final run each day I would often think about how I wanted to write this all up. So here it is. I hope you learned something too.",10/9/20

30-murphs-workout-heart-rate-data,30 Murphs in 30 Days: What I Saw in My WHOOP Data,"HRV, Recovery & Sleep Analysis
A closer examination of my 2020 WHOOP data shows some peaks and troughs, but overall improvements in virtually all metrics. Take a look at my HRV, shown in 7, 14 and 30-day averages:
When viewing my daily WHOOP recovery for the month (see below), you can see a nice spike in green about the halfway point. That was for the Wodapalooza competition in Miami, peaking at the right time!
But this next part is what’s really wild to me: Only 1 (ONE!) red recovery (33% or lower) over the entire 30 days.
My best theory on this is that HRV is the main driver of recovery, and my HRV was rising due to improved fitness, so as a result my recoveries were generally strong. Also, I was sleeping more than usual because I knew that I was putting a beating on my body, so I was accumulating more restorative time (REM and deep sleep).
The 6:33 of sleep per night is my highest 30-day total since starting residency. Looking back at my data, my average sleep per night throughout residency (June 2018 to present) has been 5:40 (with std dev of 32 minutes). Thus, my average sleep for the month was 1.65 standard deviations above baseline. Wow. That’s a lot.
Knowing that I was putting my body through the ringer, I prioritized sleep and recovery in order to maintain high levels of performance. At the same time that I was doing Murph, we were unveiling our study on residency wellness/burnout (linked above) and I vividly remember a phone discussion with Dr. Jamie Coleman immediately following a workout one day. Her response was “You’re crazy.”
This was also during peak COVID, and I was actually working in the Emergency Department at the time, which was quite the experience. I would do the workout before work (5-6 am) or immediately after work (which sometimes was as late as 9-10 pm as the hospital can be quite unpredictable). Interestingly, more rest time between workouts did not correlate with faster times.",10/9/20

My Pace: 6:30-6:10/mile
The Workout: 4-mile tempo starting at 6:30/mile, cutting down to 6:10/mile
The goal for this workout is to stay in a hard, but comfortable zone without feeling totally gassed at the end (the way speed intervals often feel). Physiologically, you are running at your max threshold before your body starts generating more lactic acid than it can handle to reconvert back into energy. Here, my heart rate is usually around 160-170 bpm. These runs are the trickiest, because it’s easy to want to go faster because you know you can, but that’s not the point.
Going faster than needed during your tempo runs will ultimately detract from your training, because you’re not learning how to maintain composure in a threshold state, and you are increasing recovery time needed. For these runs, I start out at a comfortable pace around 6:30-6:40/mile, and pick it up to about 6:20/mile towards the end.

Elevated heart rate close to max while running a race.
Race day is a day you either dread, or can’t wait for. If you’ve done the work, there’s nothing to fear. The sample of data below is from a 5k I ran in Boston. According to my HR data, I probably could have pushed a little harder to average a few beats higher per minute, but effort-wise I remember the race felt good and was a solid start to the cross-country season.
The biggest mistake you can make as a runner is to treat all your runs equally. If you go the same pace for each run, you’re not going to get faster. If you’re constantly exacerbating your heart rate and staying in elevated training zones, you’re going to burn out. By monitoring your runs day by day, specifically your heart rate and your recovery (WHOOP calculates resting heart rate, heart rate variability, and quality of sleep and factors this into an overall Recovery score), it’s much easier to stay on par with your training, and to know when your body needs to rest.

4-essential-runs-running-heart-rate,Running Heart Rate Zones & 4 Essential Runs to Boost Endurance & Train Smarter,"I’ve been a runner since middle school, when I first discovered running by participating in my hometown’s track races each summer. Back then, I had no race strategy and I didn’t know what “peaking” meant. I didn’t wear a GPS watch and I didn’t know my pace.
Today I’m a little wiser thanks to the coaches, doctors and physical therapists who have educated me on proper running form and helped me overcome various injuries and frustrating training plateaus. With 16 years of running experience under my belt, I’ve learned the hard way that success comes down to the numbers and the science behind the art of running, but not necessarily how I feel about my body. I’ve had days where I wake up and feel like garbage, but then I set a personal record in my race. Oftentimes, pre-race nerves and our own self-doubt cloud our ability to trust our fitness gains.
## Running, Heart Rate & Training
If you’re looking to start running and boost your physical activity, WHOOP can be a great tool for monitoring effort (strain) and recovery–two things that runners can easily underestimate. With WHOOP, I can monitor the following:
Time spent in specific heart rate training zones
Daily nuances and long-term trends in heart rate variability and resting heart rate
Time spent in REM and Deep Sleep (crucial sleep stages that aid in recovery)
Day-to-day recovery before and after tough workouts
Depending on what kind of run I’m doing, my heart rate monitor data is going to look very different. WHOOP takes a lot of heavy lifting off my plate. I use the data to reassure that I’m doing the right things, and to incorporate additional days of rest if I notice my body isn’t recovering properly.",10/24/21

The following four runs are crucial to any competitive runner’s training plan, and should be monitored appropriately to avoid overtraining and maximize fitness goals (for beginners, I also highly recommend hiring a coach and joining a local club for support and running resources).

1. The Long Run (Heart Rate Zone: 70% of Max)
Training Zone: Aerobic
My Pace: 7:30-8:00/mile
The Workout: 12 miles at recovery pace
Often coined as the “Church of the Sunday Long Run,” running longer distances on Sundays is a quintessential part of the running culture. It’s a perfect way to cap off a tough week of training and spend time alone on the roads thinking about everything from existential life questions to what kind of donuts you want for brunch. The long run is a sacred time of reflection.
Your long runs should be approximately 25% of your total weekly mileage. For instance, I run 45-50 miles per week. My long runs are generally 11-13 miles. During these runs, I should feel relaxed and able to hold a light conversation. These runs build your endurance, allowing you to sustain aerobic movement for extended periods of time. Mentally, they teach you how to be patient and how to settle into a smooth, relaxed (but not sluggish) pace.
What Target Heart Rate is Too High?
In the chart below, my long run lasted about 90 minutes and my heart rate averaged 139 beats per minute. It felt comfortable without feeling lazy. My WHOOP data shows which zones my heart rate fluctuated between, and gives me reassurance that I wasn’t pushing my body harder than I needed to be (I stopped twice to stretch and grab water, hence the dip in HR). Some people may feel comfortable at different paces or heart rates, so it is important to pay attention to cardiovascular effort relative to your max (here’s more on how to calculate your maximum heart rate).

*Note: volume and pace will depend on what you are training for. This workout was in preparation for a 5k.
Speed intervals are an important part of training because they tap into your max aerobic capacity, allowing you to improve your VO2 fitness level and train your legs to have faster turnover. These types of workouts are where you feel “the burn” associated with lactate buildup and short rest. Typically, your body can only handle 1-2 workouts like this a week. For me, I can only do one as it takes me 3-4 days to fully recover before I can put that much stress on my body again.

Massage
We all know massage will help you recover–but it’s not just any massage for NFL players, it’s a specific kind of massage called ART (Active Release Technique) or MAT (Muscular Activation Technique). ART and MAT are forms of manual therapy that focus on increasing range of motion and releasing stuck myofascial and neural connections in muscle groups.
“General massage helps move things around, but using MAT to make sure there aren’t heavy asymmetrical imbalances in your body makes you less at risk of injury,” Luke said.
Another former teammate, Richie, told me that he has three sessions during a typical in-season week, two general massages and one with a dedicated ART specialist. He also schedules two sessions per week with a chiropractor. Here are links to find MAT/ART specialists in your area:
https://muscleactivation.com/clients/find-a-specialist/

### Nutrition
Nutrition
Luke credits sleep and nutrition as the two things that factor most into recovery. Nutrition is critically important during periods of high-intensity exercise in order to maintain optimal performance. Understanding specific macronutrient needs will help replenish what you use during the day, and enable the growth needed to adapt to your training. As a professional football player myself, I have to eat nearly 6000 calories per day in order to maintain my bodyweight.
It’s important to distinguish between dietitians and nutritionists–all dietitians are nutritionists but not all nutritionists are dietitians. There are exams, education, and continuing ed requirements necessary to become a registered dietitian. Every high-level athlete should consult a dietitian in order to determine individual goals and put together a diet plan with specific macronutrient ratios. You can find a list of local registered dietitians here:

Sleep
Research shows that sleep extension can dramatically improve cognitive and physical performance on the field. For example, consider the results of a study published by the Oxford Academic Sleep Research Society on basketball players. Participants ran a 282-foot sprint in an average of 16.2 seconds before a period of sleep extension, compared to only 15.5 seconds afterwards. Additionally, free-throw percentage increased 9%, while three-point percentage rose 9.2%.
“Understanding sleep was big for me,” Richie explained. “It was the one thing I wasn’t able to monitor well. I had tried a bunch of apps, things under the bed, but nothing synced up heart-rate-monitoring with sleep and recovery.” That mindset pointed him in the direction of No. 5 on this list…
### WHOOP
WHOOP
Richie is now a huge proponent of using WHOOP to aid in recovery. He wears it to track the quantity and quality of the sleep he gets, as well as to gauge the stress his body undergoes throughout the season and during NFL games. It enables him to understand how ready he is to take on strain each day.
“I got into using WHOOP to learn more about my recovery and my sleep,” Richie said. “It was super resourceful for me to put a number on things. It was also interesting to be able to look at all the data and assess it myself without someone else explaining it to me.” WHOOP prides itself on putting actionable data directly into the hands of athletes.
With WHOOP, Richie is able to see how NFL games affected his daily strain and recovery. He told me that his body often puts in two to three times more work on game days than during the week of practice. “If WHOOP is properly used and introduced into an athlete’s life, I really do think it can be a game changer,” he proclaimed. “It puts all that raw data in guys hands. Players can use that to prolong their careers.”",3/2/18
5-ways-nfl-players-recover-how-you-can-too,5 Ways NFL Players Recover & How You Can Too,"## How NFL Players Recover
My journey in the NFL is no different than most players–we strive to compete at the highest level for as long as possible. To be able to perform week in and week out, recovery is critical.
Recovery protocols differ widely from player to player. We each create our own ecosystems of people and processes that we believe make us feel and play better. When rookies enter the league, the smart ones go around to the veterans and ask for tips on what they do take care of their bodies.
Saunas, steam rooms, hot/cold tubs, cryotherapy, acupuncture, massage, shock therapy, neurofeedback, electro-stimulation, cranial sacral therapy, chiropractic, and transcranial photobiomodulation are just a few of the less crazy recovery techniques you might observe in an NFL locker room.

### Dry Needling
Dry Needling
Dry needling is a form of deep tissue work in which a therapist inserts a hypodermic needle through the skin and into muscles to release myofascial adhesions. A former teammate, Luke, used dry needling this past season to increase mobility and movement after tough games. “Later in the season like Week 13, 14 and 15, when guys were struggling, I still felt pretty fresh,” he told me.
You don’t need to see an acupuncturist for dry needling, most states allow physical therapists to administer it. The reason it’s called “dry” needling is because nothing is injected under the skin. Here’s a link to find a therapist that does dry needling near you:

Obviously I do my best to get plenty of sleep the night before and have a good recovery.”
What do you do to recover after the race?
“That’s something I play around a lot with, there are so many options nowadays. I go to a physical therapist who works on me quite a bit, she works with my race team and is very familiar with what drivers go through. On my own I do a mixed bag of things, I use leg compression technology, salt baths, and I try to do the cryo chamber somewhat regularly. Ice baths and the cryo chamber I think are great, both for injury prevention, but also for chronic tightness and little nagging things.”
Finally, what are your career goals going forward?
“As a racecar driver, your immediate goal is to contend for a win every weekend. I race in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, which is one level below the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series. That’s my goal, to race on Sundays in the Cup Series against the best in the world. I’m working really hard to get there.
Another huge goal of mine is to continue to raise awareness about diabetes and encourage people to live healthy lifestyles. But most importantly, I want to send the message not to ever give up on your dreams because of a disease you didn’t choose. There are so many kids who get diagnosed with diabetes and are given information that points them to just focusing on living and managing it. That’s not the case, that’s not what life’s about.”",8/29/18
9-questions-ryan-reed-nascar-driver-diabetes,"9 Questions with Ryan Reed, NASCAR Driver with Diabetes","What WHOOP did for my diabetes management was incredible as well. I quickly figured out that when I get the right amount of sleep and am properly recovered, I see amazing effects in my blood sugar the next day.
For people with diabetes, a consistent diet, paired with eating at the right times and taking the proper amount of insulin at those times, is crucial. When I’m well rested, my hunger cravings are so much more controlled and I do much less snacking, which makes it a lot easier for me to plan my meals and eat at a controlled schedule.”
How did WHOOP change your training habits?
“I’m always trying to stay on the cutting edge with my training and be the best I can be inside the racecar. I’ve done everything from CrossFit, to kickboxing, to triathlon training–you name it, I’ve tried it. I’ve learned that a mix of endurance-based training (a lot of cycling and running) and strength training (more of a standard weightlifting routine) works well for me. WHOOP helps me plan my workouts accordingly.
When I’m not recovered, I do something with a lower base heart rate, maybe a weightlifting workout that’s not too taxing and won’t burn me out mentally. When my HRV is lower than I want it to be I don’t push myself like I would on hard workout days, I make it a recovery day instead of a high-strain day.
The days that I am well recovered I really attack. I go for 30 to 40-mile bike rides, and maybe mix in weightlifting as well. Since I began using WHOOP, I’ve noticed that I never feel burned out. I’m always motivated, always excited to get to the gym. I’m not pushing myself too hard and dreading workouts like I used to sometimes.”
Below is a week-long example from earlier this summer of Ryan’s efforts to balance his daily Strain (blue) and Recovery (red, yellow and green):",8/29/18
9-questions-ryan-reed-nascar-driver-diabetes,"9 Questions with Ryan Reed, NASCAR Driver with Diabetes","Ryan Reed began racing cars when he was four years old. “That was when my dad bought me a go-kart,” he told us. “My mom wasn’t too thrilled about it, but I had such a passion for racing at such an early age and it was very evident how much I loved it. I raced go-karts until I was in my early teens, then miniature stock cars in my mid teens and full-size stock cars when I was 15-16. From there, the transition happened pretty fast into the bigger car stuff.”
It was shortly after that when Ryan’s racing career nearly came to a crashing halt before it even started. At the age of 17, he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes.
We spoke with Ryan about what it’s like to compete professionally with diabetes, his race preparation and training techniques, and how WHOOP helps him manage his disease and be a better athlete.
How were you were first diagnosed?
“In 2011, I was nearing the end of high school and getting ready to move from California to North Carolina, which is kind of the hub for NASCAR. I was really excited about the move. I was going to drive for one of the sport’s premier names in his developmental program.
The winter before, I’d started getting pretty sick. I just remember throughout the offseason (roughly November through March) I felt really sick. I was losing a lot of weight, and was dehydrated and fatigued all the time. After I had those symptoms for a couple months, I went to the doctor and he diagnosed me with Type 1 diabetes. He actually told me that I would never race again. Hearing that was by far the most traumatic part of the whole thing for me.”
Where did you go from there?
“I didn’t really know where to go or what to do. I didn’t know anything about diabetes or anyone who had it, and I didn’t know of any pro athletes or racecar drivers who had it.",8/29/18

I may radio my team and say ‘Hey guys, I’m coming in for tires, fuel, and my blood sugar is too high so I need insulin too.’ That’s something we practice and get really comfortable doing. Fortunately, it’s more of a safety net. I work really hard to start the race where I need to be as far as my blood sugar goes so I don’t have to rely on that.
On the other hand, if my blood sugar is too low, I have a drink in the car with me. It’s basically just a sports drink that we add some other things to to increase the glucose content.”
When did you discover WHOOP, and what did it do for you?
“I’ve got an amazing partnership with Lilly Diabetes, this is our fifth year together. They’re a great company that does wonderful things for people with diabetes. I went up to Boston last year and one of my friends who works for Lilly and a bunch of his colleagues were using WHOOP. They started telling me about it and I was really excited to try it. With the nutrition and training side of things becoming extremely important for me ever since I was diagnosed, I was really eager to see all the information WHOOP could give me.
Within the first two weeks, WHOOP got me to change my training regimen and my race-day approach, it benefited my professional life almost immediately. Racing is such a physically demanding sport, much more than people think. The mental aspect of it is unbelievably strenuous. You’re in the car for three hours at 120, 130, sometimes even 140-degree temperatures, it’s so easy to get physically and mentally fatigued. When I’m rested and recovered heading into a race, I’m just so much sharper inside the car.",8/29/18

Ryan finished 8th that evening in the Alsco 300 at the Kentucky Speedway, posting a Strain of 15.7 (on a scale of 0-21) during his time on the track. His heart rate maxed out at 184 beats per minute:
And what about your sleeping habits?
“They’ve changed dramatically. I try to get in bed earlier now, I know that’s simple, but it really helps me. I also put my phone away now before I get in bed.
One of the things I love about WHOOP is the immediate feedback. If you try something new, you’ll know right away if it’s a positive result. For example, I used to always drink a Diet Coke with dinner. I quit doing that to see if the little bit of caffeine had an effect. I noticed instantly that I had tremendously better sleep. Now it’s no caffeine after 4 pm for me, and it makes a huge difference.”
How do you prepare for races each week?
“As the summer goes on, it gets increasingly more difficult inside the racecar. Heat exhaustion is for sure the primary thing that all drivers face. The best thing I can do to combat that is to build my endurance, which for me means a lot of cycling. That’s what helps me feel the freshest inside the car.
Mondays I make sure to get physical therapy, or do a stretching and rollout routine that morning. Then I like to start the week off with a solid one or two-hour cycling session. I also try to get a lift in that evening after dinner. Tuesdays I may start tapering a little, maybe go for a short 20-30 minute run, mixed in with a long lifting workout to really tear up some muscle but still have a few days to recover before I race.
Wednesdays I usually do a moderate cycle ride and don’t get the heart rate too high. Thursdays are often a travel day, I may do a quick run or if I can get to a gym, a light workout. Fridays are normally a practice day in the car, so I don’t usually work out.",8/29/18
9-questions-ryan-reed-nascar-driver-diabetes,"9 Questions with Ryan Reed, NASCAR Driver with Diabetes","At first, I just started doing some research and learning how to manage it, what that would mean for me personally, not professionally. I spent a month or so just kind of learning how to get through the days. I’d hated needles my whole life, so taking shots twice a day and all that stuff was definitely a huge transition for me.
Not long after that, I began doing research on professional athletes with diabetes. I read all these unbelievable and inspiring stories about people doing incredible things. A lot of the athletes worked with one particular endocrinologist, a diabetes specialist in southern California, right near where I grew up. We reached out to her many times, she had an extremely long waiting list. Eventually, she agreed to see me.
My first doctor’s visit with her was immediately the transformation I needed. In the first five minutes, she promised me that after working together I’d be back in a racecar. That was one of the single most important moments of my life. She’s still my doctor today.”
As a driver, what do you have to do differently because you have diabetes?
“One of the keys right off the bat is being able to know what my blood sugar is, that’s kind of the cornerstone of diabetes management. I have a wireless continuous glucose monitor in my car. It’s a sensor that goes inside my stomach through a little hair wire underneath my skin. It communicates with a receiver on my dashboard that looks kind of like a cell phone. I can see what my blood sugar is, what it’s been doing over the last few hours, where it’s trending, etc. From there, I can make decisions on what I need to do.",8/29/18
a-day-with-team-usa-track-star-wallace-spearmon-jr,A Day with Team USA Track Star Wallace Spearmon Jr.,"As Wallace laid on the trainer’s table he described what he likes about WHOOP metrics:
“It confirms what I already know. I didn’t sleep very well last night and my Recovery reflects it. I know what I can give in practice today.”
Wallace took his time on the table getting his muscles worked on. He joked with the trainers that, at his age, he needs to get every piece of the puzzle right (he’s only 32, but that doesn’t stop Beejay and the other guys in their early 20s from calling him “Old Man”). As the trainer wrapped up, Wallace made a point of thanking the medical team for being there. This display of gratitude was equal parts unexpected and genuine, and the strong impression it made on the trainers was evident.
Sufficiently warmed up, the relay groups separated to their respective segments of the track to practice handing off the baton. This is technical and requires precision, particularly amongst short sprinters who are barreling down the track at top end speed. The coaches looked to Wallace to set the tone; the whole practice, in fact, seemed to operate under Wallace’s watchful eye. He offhandedly mentioned something to me about being called the “Mayor of Track and Field,” which very much felt like an apropos title.
For the most part, the athletes seemed to stay focused on their own rituals and routines. They talked to one another and came together as a team nicely, but there was marked independence in how they each went about their pre-meet preparation.
The same was not true of Wallace. He pulled John (the guy running the closing leg) aside and demonstrated how to better make a target with his hand when receiving the baton. Fresh in Wallace’s memory must have been the botched handoff of training parter Tyson Gay in last year’s 4×100 meter running at Penn.",5/15/17
a-day-with-team-usa-track-star-wallace-spearmon-jr,A Day with Team USA Track Star Wallace Spearmon Jr.,"Successfully grabbing snacks, Wallace and I walked together to the charter buses that were awaiting the full Team USA roster. One-by-one, athletes emerged from the hotel and made their way onto the buses. As a bystander, two things became abundantly clear to me:
On the ride out to the Haverford College track, the athletes joked and bantered like cousins at a family reunion. As they chatted, I was steadily introduced to each of the members of Team USA’s 4×100 meter relay. The first leg would be run by LeShon Collins, a 2016 graduate of the University of Houston. Wallace would be second. Beejay Lee, a 2015 grad of USC, would run third leg. Finally, the last leg would be run by John Teeters, a 2016 grad of Oklahoma State. Besides Wallace, all three of these guys were donning the Team USA jersey for their first appearance at Penn Relays as a professional athlete.
What struck me in learning about the life of a professional track athlete is how little time they get together to establish that sense of team I felt so readily on the bus. Take these four men as an example: Each of them trains with their own coach at their alma mater in four separate states. They’ve only met a handful of times at meets prior, and have never before run on a relay team together. After the effort at Penn, in fact, it’s likely that foursome won’t cross paths until the next Olympic year and it’s doubtful the same four will ever be on a relay together again. Despite the distance, the camaraderie and chemistry is natural amongst these men.
These conditions that underscore the reality of a professional track career demand discipline and grit. In the lonely years outside of the Olympics, it’s entirely up to the athlete to individually maintain the fitness and strength necessary to be competitive for an eventual Team USA slot. It’s an environment fraught with variables and few systems of support; as such, a professional track athlete knows their locus of control is his or her own body.
Enter WHOOP.",5/15/17
a-day-with-team-usa-track-star-wallace-spearmon-jr,A Day with Team USA Track Star Wallace Spearmon Jr.,"The baton exchanges finished up and the athletes went about packing up their equipment to board the bus. Wallace, again, brought up the rear. He walked the track picking up the tape and trash left behind from the practice session on the way to getting his gear.
I sat on the stands with some of the USATF staff who were there to support the practice. When I told them I was hanging out with Wallace for the day, one of them responded with the perfect summation of my first impression of him:
“I’ve tried to come up with something unlikeable about Wallace. I have yet to find one.”
The next day, LeShon, Wallace, Beejay, and John made their way into historic Franklin Field, the coliseum-like stadium that is home to the Penn Relays Carnival. They were met by the deafening exaltations of the Jamaican cheering section that’s an annual fixture lining the home stretch. Would Jamaica upset Team USA for a second year in a row? Check out the video below to see how our guys (labeled USA Red, but wearing blue) fared:

How Prioritizing Recovery Led Me to Greatness, by Wallace Spearmon Jr.",5/15/17
a-day-with-team-usa-track-star-wallace-spearmon-jr,A Day with Team USA Track Star Wallace Spearmon Jr.,"For track and field, the pinnacle of the sport is competing on the world’s biggest stage at the Olympics. Regardless of where you grew up or how far you made it competitively, as a track athlete you can’t help but fantasize about representing your country on the national team. So, when I got the opportunity to meet the athletes on Team USA at this year’s Penn Relays “USA vs. the World” series, needless to say I was beyond excited. My guide for the day? Two-time Olympian and 8th-fastest 200-meter athlete in history, Wallace Spearmon Jr.
I met Wallace in the downtown Marriott lobby where the USA Track and Field (USATF) athletes were housed for the weekend. All of the athletes had arranged their own travel to arrive some time on Thursday evening to convene that Friday morning (7:45 am) as a group. I knew exactly who Wallace was, so I approached him with a less-than-cool utterance of “Wallace, hi!” Facial recognition off the table, he searched my wrists for a WHOOP. Passing that test, Wallace nodded and shook my hand.
“Are you wearing yours?” I asked. He pulled back his jacket sleeve to reveal his own strap.
“I never take it off,” he said coolly back with a little side eye, suggesting the silliness of the question. His eyes clearly conveyed what I too know about WHOOP data: Once you’re on the system, you rely on it.
Wallace had invited me to shadow him for the day as he and the other athletes went through their pre-meet practice at a neighboring college track. First, however, was breakfast. He ran across the street to a corner store to pick up apple slices and a granola bar. I would soon learn from chatting with Bernard “Beejay” Lee, another Team USA athlete, that they have to provide all of their own meals on these trips.",5/15/17
a-familiar-story-of-preventing-overtraining,A Familiar Story of Preventing Overtraining,"David began using WHOOP last winter and he’s consistently achieved new levels of success on the squash court ever since. “I’ve been playing much better since I got the WHOOP,” he noted. “I just won the Madison Spring Open in Madison, Wisconsin at the most competitive level that they have. I also won the New York Grand Open back in January.”
What has WHOOP done to make such a difference in David’s game?
“There’s a very simple answer,” he said. “It has prevented me from overtraining. Before, I would constantly get stuck in cycles of overtraining. I always thought that to get better I needed to hit more or I needed to train more, rather than training or hitting smarter. Some days I would feel really raggedy, but I would think to myself ‘Whatever’ and still train hard. My outcomes weren’t matching the time I was putting in. Since I’ve had the WHOOP, when my Recovery is low I temper my workouts the best I can. I only go really hard when I’m in the green. I’ve found that I’m getting much more out of it and my preparation is significantly better for tournament weekends.”
Take a look at six data points in David’s training over the month before his tournament win in Madison:
Additionally, David showed a positive trend in HRV in the three weeks leading up to the tournament. This trend, in combination with stable resting heart rates, is an indication that David is increasing his fitness.
Likely due to the intensity of his matches, his HRV took a hit over the course of the tournament from April 21st through 23rd. On the final morning of the event, David emerged victorious with a 62% Recovery, a byproduct of his decreased HRV. However, David also offered another explanation:
“Funny story,” he chuckled. “I brought my two oldest sons, Max and Leo, with me on that trip, they are six and three years old. We made a boys weekend out of it. Those two guys kept me awake most of the night with their shenanigans, but it was a lot of fun.”",5/18/17
a-familiar-story-of-preventing-overtraining,A Familiar Story of Preventing Overtraining,"When WHOOP CEO Will Ahmed was a college squash player at Harvard, he struggled with overtraining. In his first post on The Locker, Will wrote “Like many athletes, I believed I could just keep pushing. I overtrained every season. My body couldn’t keep up with its stresses and my relentless mindset.” Will’s experience as an athlete made him question why we don’t have a better understanding of our own bodies, and put him on the path to founding WHOOP.
When David Almeida, a 37-year-old vitreoretinal eye surgeon in St. Paul, Minnesota, heard Will’s story, he knew that WHOOP was for him.
“I’m a pretty serious competitive squash player on the side,” David told WHOOP. “I’ve been playing squash for about 10 years, the last five years really competitively. I just kind of picked it up when I was in medical school. It was convenient to play when you had a little bit of downtime, and you could get great exercise from it. I started playing with friends, and then from there I really got obsessed with it.”
As both a doctor and a high-level athlete, David has always felt the need to monitor his physiology and performance as best he can. “I went through all the iterations of other fitness trackers and was getting kind of frustrated,” he said. “Whether it be step counting, or something else, I didn’t know what to make of some of the metrics that they showed me. I saw an article about a new one going on sale to the public that was designed by a squash player. ‘Oh man,’ I said, ‘if a squash player is behind this, this is going to be the one for me!’”
“I was really compelled by the idea of Strain and Recovery,” he added. “And I already had some insight into heart rate variability (HRV) from my medical training, so that piqued my interest as well.”",5/18/17

a-familiar-story-of-preventing-overtraining,A Familiar Story of Preventing Overtraining,"Outside of squash, CrossFit is the other main component of David’s workout regimen. He employs a personal trainer in St. Paul named Sherri Smith, who’s also a WHOOP user. “We do 3-4 intense CrossFit sessions per week and tailor my workouts based on my Recovery,” he explained. “We incorporate WHOOP into every aspect of training, including lowering the Strain of my workouts on poor Recovery days and on days leading up to tournaments. I also travel a lot for work and that usually affects my Recovery, so we adjust my workouts accordingly.”
David elaborated on how CrossFit helps him improve his squash game: “I try to find correlations between heart rate zone and the Strain of various exercise circuits. I look for circuits or groups of exercises that require a significant cardiovascular burden as a means to increase my endurance on the squash court. Ideally, I want to take on the most strain possible without compromising my current state, or my Recovery tomorrow.”
For example, on May 11th, David logged two activities, CrossFit and Squash. His heart rate zones are very similar for each:
CrossFit allows David to exercise different muscle groups in his body while mimicking the cardiovascular load of a squash match, building his endurance for his sport.
After sharing the details of what he does to optimize performance at this stage of his career, David also speculated on what WHOOP might’ve been able to do for him in his younger days:
“It would’ve helped me for sure in medical school. I remember those overnight shifts when I worked 24-30 hours. You don’t feel yourself, you know you’re not yourself, it would’ve been very useful to know what the WHOOP was telling me back then in terms of Recovery and ability to function through the day at a high level.”",5/18/17

Or if consuming dairy yesterday affected today’s Recovery? It’s easier than ever to discover which behaviors affect you daily with an all-new Impacts.
## How does it work?
Impacts are daily insights that help you understand the specific habits or behaviors that help or hurt your Recovery, so you can optimize your performance. Choose from over 140+ different habits or behaviors to track in the Journal across everything from diet to mental health to see what impacts you and your unique physiology.
## What’s Different?
WHOOP has always analyzed which behaviors and habits affect your Recovery as part of the Monthly Performance Assessment (MPA), available at the start of every month. Now with Impacts, these insights are easier to find, and they’re refreshed daily. Plus, you can now learn more about why certain behaviors may have a physiological impact on you – and you can get recommendations on how to optimize behaviors or to build a routine around them.
The more behaviors and habits you track, the more you can learn about yourself, and the better you can optimize your performance.
## Unexpected Impacts
What if you see positive Recovery impacts from drinking alcohol? While alcohol typically negatively impacts Recovery, sometimes there are other factors at play. You may have consumed alcohol on a less stressful day, or maybe you didn’t work out as much, so the positive impact of lower Stress and Strain outweighed the negative. When you review your Impacts, keep in mind that sometimes there are confounding factors at play that might provide unexpected results.",4/13/23
a-whole-new-ballgame,A Whole New Ballgame,"Given the opportunity, wouldn’t a manager prefer to rely on some sort of empirical evidence, as opposed to just his instincts and what his player says?
WHOOP puts that option on the table.
There are physiological signs, “secrets your body is trying to tell you,” in the words of WHOOP founder Will Ahmed, that can be measured and used to indicate if an athlete is properly prepared to handle the demands of competition. Considering that individual players will respond differently to their workloads, there’s a need to be able to accurately quantify how each athlete is adapting to stress. But if every pitcher operates on the same schedule and routine throughout the year, how can the manager know who’s most likely to succeed on a more aggressive timetable in the playoffs?
WHOOP aims to mitigate the uncertainty associated with these critical decisions. Our 24/7 analysis provides an enormous amount of insight into what is “normal” for each athlete in terms of Recovery. Over time, the manager may learn that his No. 1 guy returns to baseline after just two or three days off, while another pitcher might take longer.
A season’s worth of WHOOP data could be an extraordinarily useful tool for Francona as he tries to determine just how much he can get out of Miller in the World Series.",10/28/16
a-whole-new-ballgame,A Whole New Ballgame,"In Major League Baseball’s postseason, the rules and guidelines that teams generally abide by regarding pitchers’ availability are tossed right out the window. Instead of every fifth day, elite starters often take the ball with only three days rest, sometimes two. Occasionally, they are called upon to make appearances out of the bullpen as well. Relievers are commonly asked to pitch longer and more frequently than they are accustomed to during the regular season. When a championship is on the line, managers naturally do whatever it takes to win by leaning on their best arms as much as possible.
It’s a whole new ballgame.
The Chicago Cubs qualified for their first World Series in 71 years without changing their normal pitching patterns–a benefit of having the best record in baseball and a staff made up of several top-tier starters. However, Chicago’s opponent in the National League Championship Series, the Los Angeles Dodgers, relied heavily on their ace, Clayton Kershaw.
In the divisional round, Kershaw won Game 1 against the Washington Nationals, then came back on short rest for Game 4. While his team got a victory that evening, Kershaw allowed 5 runs in just 6.2 innings. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts then elected to deploy Kershaw out of the bullpen with only one day off as L.A. clinched the series in Game 5.
Kershaw was spectacular in Game 2 of the NLDS just three nights later, hurling seven shutout innings in the Dodgers’ 1-0 win. But in Game 6, he gave up four earned runs in five innings, and his club was eliminated with a 5-0 defeat. Although Kershaw went five days between starts before his final outing, it’s quite possible his irregular schedule and excessive use throughout the playoffs took its toll.",10/28/16
a-whole-new-ballgame,A Whole New Ballgame,"The Cleveland Indians, on the other hand, arrived at the Fall Classic on the back of reliever Andrew Miller, who was named American League Championship Series MVP following multiple outstanding performances vs. the Toronto Blue Jays. In particular, Miller pitched on consecutive days in the first two games of the series, locking down 2-0 and 2-1 victories. Miller threw 1.2 innings in Game 1 and another two innings in Game 2, striking out 10 of the 12 batters he faced during his longest back-to-back appearances of the season.
In Game 1 of the World Series, Miller preserved Cleveland’s 6-0 triumph by throwing 46 pitches over two scoreless innings, his highest pitch count of the year. Miller has yet to surrender a run during the postseason, but eventually the extra workload may catch up to him. How far can Indians skipper Terry Francona push his hard-throwing lefty?
Questions regarding a pitcher’s ability to compete at an optimal level on short rest usually revolve around whether or not his arm will be at full strength. More often than not, this comes down to if he says he’s “good to go,” and what the manager feels in his gut.
Maybe the star hurler’s arm really is in decent shape after less than a usual amount of time off. Maybe it’s still sore, but he’s confident he can push through the pain. Or, maybe he’s fully aware that he’s far less than 100 percent, but there’s also no way he’ll let this chance to compete in the playoffs pass him by. Regardless, it’s a gamble, and it’s impossible for the manager to know the whole truth about the condition of his player.
What if arm strength isn’t the only thing that needs to be restored? Pitching in a major league game requires extraordinary physical and mental effort. Achieving a sufficient level of Recovery between appearances goes well beyond simply being capable of throwing the baseball.",10/28/16

accomplish-top-new-years-resolutions,Top New Year's Resolutions & How WHOOP Can Help You Accomplish Them,"Consume Less Alcohol
A very simple thing to chronicle with WHOOP is the negative impact alcohol has on your body. Alcohol consumption increases your RHR, lowers your HRV and degrades the quality of your sleep–all of which contribute to significantly worse next-day recoveries (and beyond). In fact, when WHOOP members log drinking alcohol in the Journal, on average their recovery dips by 8%.
Conversely, the positive effects of avoiding alcohol are also readily noticeable in your WHOOP data. Not only will your recoveries improve, but you’ll likely spend more time in REM and deep sleep and make greater fitness gains from your workouts.

## Reduce Stress
Stress elevates your heart rate, which in turn increases the strain your body takes on each day. When WHOOP members report experiencing stress, they often notice decreased HRV, lower recoveries, and poorer sleep performances.
Meditation and diaphragmatic breathing are two common methods we see to reduce stress and improve recovery. Additionally, practicing mindfulness for as little as 1 minute per day can help get you on the right track to leading a less stressful life.

One of the first things people often realize when they start wearing WHOOP is that they don’t actually sleep as much as they thought. Being in bed for 8 hours is not the same thing as sleeping for 8 hours. WHOOP tells you exactly how much time you spend in each of the 4 stages of sleep: Light, deep/slow wave, REM, and awake.
Based on your unique physiology, previous amount of sleep, and recent strain on your body, the WHOOP Sleep Planner calculates precisely how much sleep you need every night, plus the ideal time to go to bed in order to make it happen. And by taking steps to ensure you’re getting enough REM and deep sleep (the restorative stages of sleep), you’ll wake up feeling refreshed and recovered.
WHOOP also tracks your sleep consistency, which is the similarity of your bed and wake times on a day-to-day basis. Sleep consistency helps maintain your circadian rhythm, and will improve the quality and efficiency of your sleep as well.

Our Monthly Performance Assessments reveal changes in your metrics that correlate with specific responses in the Journal feature. When logging diets like Keto, Paleo, or plant-based, many members have noticed better recoveries, increased HRV and lower resting heart rates.
An often overlooked component of healthy eating is simply to drink more water. In an analysis of WHOOP Journal responses, the behavior linked with the greatest increase in daily recovery was proper hydration.

Why?
A primary reason is that we often lack the right accountability structure to enable us to make meaningful changes–in particular when these changes involve improving our health and overall well-being.
## “WHOOP Keeps Me Accountable.”
The quote above is something we hear quite often from WHOOP members. By quantifying the strain your body takes on each day, tracking your sleep in detail each night, and measuring your recovery each morning, WHOOP enables you to truly “know yourself.”
Features like the Sleep Planner and Strain Target provide you with actionable insights and recommendations, and by logging specific behaviors in the WHOOP Journal you can see the impact of various lifestyle choices on your physiological data.

acquires-push-velocity-based-training-solution,"WHOOP Acquires PUSH, the Velocity-Based Training Coaching Solution","BOSTON, September 2, 2021 – WHOOP, the human performance company, today announced the acquisition of PUSH, a Toronto-based sports technology startup in a cash and stock transaction. The two wearable technology companies are built on a similar foundation of sports science and physiological research with a shared focus on delivering personalized data, actionable insights, and demonstrable health improvements.
PUSH focuses on velocity-based training data with a sensor that can live in multiple locations on the body to help quantify weightlifting performance via metrics like speed, power, force, and acceleration. PUSH works with hundreds of organizations and sports teams around the world, serving collegiate, professional, and Olympic athletes as well as elite military teams.
“Many of the members and organizations we serve have long asked for additional insight into the physiological impact of weightlifting and functional fitness,” said Will Ahmed, WHOOP Founder and CEO. “The integration of PUSH’s industry-leading strength-training technology into our platform will allow WHOOP to provide even deeper insight into how these activities impact the human body.”
Studies show that WHOOP can positively impact behavior and promote meaningful lifestyle changes through 24/7 continuous heart rate monitoring coupled with insights across sleep, recovery, and strain. With the acquisition of PUSH, the WHOOP platform will be equipped with a more enhanced and robust system of hardware, software, and analytics that provide comprehensive feedback on training activities and wellness.
“Our team has been dedicated to creating cutting-edge technology solutions to help athletes at all levels reach their goals and push human performance forward,” said Rami Alhamad, PUSH Founder and Chief Product Officer. “We are thrilled to join WHOOP and offer our customers a more complete picture of their training.”",9/2/21
activity-auto-detection-knows-you-work-out,Activity Auto-Detection: Your WHOOP Knows When You Work Out,"One of the key components of WHOOP is the ability to quantify the strain your body takes on. Our Strain metric allows you to understand the cardiovascular load of everything you do over the course of an entire day. It also lets you compare the effect different activities have on your body–how does your daily morning swim stack up against your after-work CrossFit session? Or what about your Saturday round of golf? WHOOP Strain gives you a number for all of these.
Previously, if you wanted to see the Strain of any given activity, you had to manually enter in the app when that activity began and ended. Now, with a new feature released this week, WHOOP can automatically detect activities for you.
## Here’s How it Works
If WHOOP notices a period of elevated heart rate and movement lasting at least 15 minutes and earning an 8.0 or higher on our 0-21 Strain scale, the text “Analyzing Elevated HR” will appear on the “Overview” screen of your app.
Your activity will still be detected and logged even if you don’t check the app immediately afterwards. However, WHOOP will wait until your heart rate has returned to a normal level for a significant period of time before processing the activity on its own (to ensure that you’re finished and not simply taking a break). In this case, it may take up to 20 minutes from the time the activity is completed for it to be logged.
If you’d prefer not to have activities logged automatically, you can go to the “Settings” page in the app and turn off “Activity Detection.”",10/24/17
activity-auto-detection-knows-you-work-out,Activity Auto-Detection: Your WHOOP Knows When You Work Out,"What are the Benefits?
If you’re someone who regularly logs activities in the WHOOP app, this feature obviously makes tracking your workouts much easier. You no longer have to worry about starting and stopping them manually, or remembering the exact times you exercised if you decide to input them after the fact. WHOOP now does all the work for you.
On the other hand, maybe you’ve used different methods for monitoring workouts in the past, or for whatever reason haven’t cared to log activities on WHOOP. If this is the case, activity auto-detection will now offer you a variety of new insights in your efforts to optimize performance.
For one, it will help you compare and contrast the various activities you do over time. Maybe your 45-minute session in the gym yesterday was more strenuous than the same workout was today? Or, maybe the 10-mile run you do four times a week puts more Strain on your body in the heat of the summer than it does the rest of the year?
We expect many WHOOP users will benefit most from activity auto-detection by gaining a better comprehension of the things they do over the course of a day that cause Strain. A common theme we’ve found in this area is that users who bike to work rarely log their commutes as activities. Oftentimes these commutes may be as strenuous as other things they consider “workouts.”
Who knows, maybe mowing your lawn next Saturday will create as much Strain as the pickup basketball game you play in on Sunday? Now you’re about to find out.

activity-auto-detection-knows-you-work-out,Activity Auto-Detection: Your WHOOP Knows When You Work Out,"How Does WHOOP Do This?
As we went about creating this feature, one of the most difficult aspects of automating activity reporting was determining what should qualify. For example, if you walk down the street at a brisk pace for 20 minutes, does that count? From a biometric standpoint, it does–you’ve got an elevated heart rate with a good amount of associated motion. But from a semantic standpoint, not many of our athlete users would consider that a “workout.”
Unlike with sleep auto-detection, “activity” is not a universally-recognized physiological state that we can use objective data to identify–it’s a mindset which our research has shown is hard to get a consensus of. Activities and workouts are all subjective to each user’s definition. Take a look at the poll below, which activity are you most likely to consider a workout?
Assuming you did all of these things, which would you be most likely to log as an activity on WHOOP?
— WHOOP (@whoop)
So, what did we do to get around this?
We started by examining user data from thousands of hours of logged workouts. That data was then set against an equally large amount of data from periods of activity that our users did not consider workouts. From there, we were able to use machine learning to build a model that could differentiate between the combinations of motion and heart rate data our users thought were activities worthy of logging, and those they did not.",10/24/17
adam-vinatieri-football-legend-whoop-android-user,"Football Legend, WHOOP for Android User","I was born in January of 1994 during a New England snowstorm. Like most other children raised in the Boston area, I grew up a Patriots fan. Many of my earliest sports memories include watching players like Ty Law, Troy Brown, and Tom Brady establish the Patriots’ identity as one of the NFL’s premier organizations.
A huge part of that identity was Adam Vinatieri.
Vinatieri made 20 game-winning kicks during his time with the Patriots. He also scored what were likely the three most important points in franchise history.
It was January of 2002, during another New England snowstorm. I had just turned eight years old and the Pats were playing the Raiders in the AFC divisional playoffs. Vinatieri was lining up for a near-impossible 45-yard field goal with 32 seconds left and a chance to send the game to overtime. At the time, I wasn’t aware of the decades of misery generations of Patriots fans had gone through. I didn’t realize they weren’t supposed to win. Moments earlier, New England’s hopes had been brought back to life by way of the infamous (and now defunct) Tuck Rule.
Somehow, through gusting winds and blinding snow, Vinatieri drilled that kick.
It was arguably the toughest, most clutch field goal in football history.
In overtime, Vinatieri hit a 28-yarder to win the game and send the Patriots on to play for the AFC title. Two weeks later, Vinatieri nailed another game-winning field goal as time expired to give the Patriots a 20-17 victory over the Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI. It was the first championship in team history. The New England Patriots’ dynasty was born.
Fast forward to 2017. Vinatieri, now 44 years old, is incredibly about to begin his 22nd NFL season. I am in my second year at WHOOP.",8/30/17

adam-vinatieri-football-legend-whoop-android-user,"Football Legend, WHOOP for Android User","As a member of the WHOOP team, I now have a unique perspective on professional athletes–from getting to work with them behind the scenes, to learning the lengths players like Vinatieri go to in order to ensure they are prepared and equipped to compete at an elite level for as long as possible.
As a fan, I have watched Vinatieri remain one of the best at his position year after year for almost my entire life.
The connection between the two is no coincidence. Adam takes incredible care of his body. He is a tireless worker and he knows exactly what his limitations are and how they’ve changed over the years. He has taken control of his career and continued to be great.
Over the decade he spent with the Patriots and the 11 seasons he’s been with the Colts, Vinatieri has appeared in five Super Bowls, winning four of them. He’s scored 234 points in the postseason and made 10 field goals in overtime, both of which are all-time records. He is also the only player in NFL history to score 1,000 points with two different teams.
If Vinatieri had a cell phone when he entered the league in 1996, it probably looked something like this:
Today, he has an Android device that allows him to view his daily Strain, Sleep and Recovery via the WHOOP app.
Vinatieri was one of the early beta testers of our Android app, now officially available to the public. “As an athlete, avoiding injuries is a top priority in order to have as long and healthy of a career as possible,” he said. ”WHOOP recognizes that I’m not an athlete three hours a day, but 24/7. It has been essential in helping me prioritize sleep and recovery, which has allowed me to train smarter. Thanks to WHOOP, I’ve got a competitive advantage come game day.”",8/30/17
adding-respiratory-rate-to-recovery,WHOOP Recovery Now Factors in Respiratory Rate,"What Drives Respiration?
Respiration plays a central role in maintaining homeostasis within the body by delivering oxygen and removing carbon dioxide from the blood. Respiratory rate is a complex metric as it responds to a variety of factors in order to maintain the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide.
For example, an increase in metabolic rate brought on by exercise causes respiratory rate to increase. But what about changes in respiratory rate at rest? WHOOP measures your respiratory rate while you’re sleeping so that acute changes to stimuli like exercise are not a factor.
At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we wrote about the science behind why we think respiratory rate may be a useful metric to track during this particular pandemic because COVID-19 is primarily a lower respiratory tract infection. It’s beyond the scope of this article to dive into that again, but even as COVID-19 has thrust respiratory rate into the spotlight, it’s worth paying attention to what respiratory rate can tell us during “normal” times.
Since WHOOP collects data even when you’re healthy, detecting smaller deviations from baseline becomes feasible. We were unable to find existing research on acute changes in respiratory rate in healthy adults, so we’ll rely on the power of aggregating WHOOP data to drive our understanding of the relationship between respiratory rate and performance.
Using WHOOP data, we examined the days when members’ respiratory rate increased compared to their baseline – but not necessarily above the generic “normal” range.",7/27/20
adding-respiratory-rate-to-recovery,WHOOP Recovery Now Factors in Respiratory Rate,"WHOOP strives to provide the most accurate analytics by continually updating the metrics and feedback we provide, based on both new research conducted by our internal R&D teams, and by academics around the world. Recently, we’ve taken a close look at respiratory rate and worked with research partners in Australia and the US to determine how this metric responds to respiratory illnesses like COVID-19.
Interestingly, we’ve found that respiratory rate also provides relevant information for predicting performance in healthy people.
Here we explore the information that respiratory rate holds – both by examining current research and analyzing WHOOP data – and then dive into our update to now include this metric in WHOOP recovery.",7/27/20
adding-respiratory-rate-to-recovery,WHOOP Recovery Now Factors in Respiratory Rate,"The x-axis divides the plane by recovery; the left side includes data points with lower recovery while the right side includes points with higher recovery. Similarly, the y-axis divides the plane by respiratory rate; the top includes data points where a member experienced a decrease in respiratory rate, and the bottom an increase in respiratory rate.
The color of each box in the plane is determined by the average performance of all data points that lie in the box. Therefore, when we look within any column of boxes, we are holding recovery constant, and within any row, we hold respiratory rate constant.
Notice that the majority of the changes in color occur as we move from left to right on the plane – i.e. as recovery changes. This makes sense; we would expect that recovery holds more information about performance than respiratory rate. However, there is still gradation in the color as we move from top to bottom in the plane, especially when recovery is low. Therefore, holding recovery constant (i.e. looking within a column), we can see that respiratory rate offers additional information relevant to performance.",7/27/20
adding-respiratory-rate-to-recovery,WHOOP Recovery Now Factors in Respiratory Rate,"Respiratory Rate Incorporated into WHOOP Recovery
While we’ve calculated respiratory rate for years for the purpose of sleep staging, we exposed it to WHOOP members first in the web app and more recently in the mobile apps to allow members to utilize this information. Incorporating respiratory rate into recovery will further enable members to action this information, particularly when changes are subtle.
Previously displayed in the sleep section of the WHOOP app, respiratory rate now appears alongside other recovery statistics:
Since respiratory rate offers the most information when recovery is low and respiratory rate is high, the update will not affect your recovery most days. Rather, only when respiratory rate is elevated, and in particular when recovery is already suppressed, respiratory rate will now be used to adjust your recovery to a more appropriate level.
Adding respiratory rate to recovery allows users to more easily leverage the information contained in the metric. Keeping an eye out for unexplained changes in any of your recovery metrics is always a good idea, and by bringing respiratory rate into recovery, we’ve made it simpler for members to interpret the complex signals their body is sending.
WHOOP is not a medical device, our products and services are not intended to diagnose COVID-19, the flu or any other disease, and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.",7/27/20
adding-respiratory-rate-to-recovery,WHOOP Recovery Now Factors in Respiratory Rate,"Respiratory Rate and WHOOP Data
After over 5 years of collecting respiratory rate from our users we’ve assembled a massive dataset, allowing us to uncover patterns in data that might otherwise go unnoticed. These patterns are sometimes too noisy to see in any individual member, but become apparent when averaging over millions of WHOOP activities.
We are particularly interested in understanding whether there exists useful information about performance within members’ nightly respiratory rate, beyond what is already captured by their resting heart rate (RHR) and heart rate variability (HRV).
we plot change in perceived athletic performance against change in respiratory rate. Note that this line represents the average of many data points, and it is expected that members sometimes experience no change in performance – or even an increase in performance – despite an increase in respiratory rate.
That said, as respiratory rate increases relative to the member’s baseline, on average, performance decreases. This trend is compatible with existing literature; an increase in respiratory rate tends to indicate that the body is struggling to maintain homeostasis.
But how much of the information that respiratory rate provides is already captured in WHOOP recovery? Changes in respiratory rate often mirror changes in resting heart rate, so it’s possible that this information is redundant for our recovery metric. To understand the unique value respiratory rate offers, we need to look at respiratory rate while recovery is held constant.

advice-from-elite-athletes-for-the-new-year,Advice from Elite Athletes for the New Year,"With 2017 right around the corner, Outside Magazine recently published a piece entitled “The Best Advice of 2016, from the World’s Best Athletes.” The author, Brad Stulburg, shared a list of quotes he’d compiled from elite athletes over the past year as guidance for others aspiring to reach that level.
Stulberg divided them into seven categories, which he calls the “keys to peak performance”–eat real food, get comfortable with pain, sleep, prime for performance, accept fear, embrace rest and prioritize mental fitness.
Sleep, rest and performance are all areas of focus when it comes to WHOOP. As is another topic the athletes mentioned frequently: Recovery. Below are several of the quotes, followed by similar things WHOOP has to say on each subject.
“Sleep is a part of my job; I take it very seriously.”
Brenda Martinez, Olympic middle-distance runner
One of our data scientists is also a former NCAA Division 1 track and field athlete. He wrote about how better sleep habits helped shave 26 seconds of his 10K time.
“Sleep is the most important thing you can do for recovery. And it’s free. In a 24-hour period, I’ll get nine to 10 hours. Usually, I’ll sleep for seven to eight hours at night and then take a two-hour nap during the day, but sometimes I’ll sleep for 10-11 hours straight.”
Mirinda Carfrae, triathlete
Our lead quantitative physiologist examined the stages of sleep and the difference between time spent in bed vs. actually sleeping. People often misjudge their sleep time by as much as an hour.
“Rest is a weapon. What was once seen as a weakness is now a strength. There are all kinds of ways to recover, what I call regenerative strategies.”

Megan Gaurnier, cyclist (pictured above)
The WHOOP Recovery metric is designed to better equip athletes to handle this situation by educating them on how prepared their bodies are each day to take on Strain.
“Recovery starts with smart training and understanding your body’s natural rhythms and cycles. How many easy days do you need after an intense day? How many weeks can you train hard before taking a break? How often can you race? If you listen to your body and are honest with yourself, you’ll be able to answer these critically important questions.”

Set goals. Whether you’ve been running for years or are just getting started, you want to have a goal in mind. It might be to lose 20 pounds, prepare for a marathon, or lower your 10k time by 5 minutes. Goals help you gauge your progress, stay motivated, and celebrate small wins.
Create a balanced routine. If you’re just starting out, don’t go overboard with 300 minutes of exercise each week. Work up to 300 minutes if that’s your goal, but start with 30 minutes a day, as mentioned above. Spread your workouts throughout the week, and don’t sweat it if you miss one. Do a combination of moderate and vigorous activities, like walking and running or a leisurely bike ride and spinning.
Mix it up. Add different activities to keep boredom at bay. Cross-training options like cycling or bodyweight workouts can add interest to your walk-run schedule. Strength training twice a week will make sure you’re working all your major muscle groups.
Build activity into your daily routine. Being stuck in an office (whether at home or in the workplace) is a fine excuse to get up and take a walk to the coffee machine. Extend that walk to a stroll around the office, up and down your apartment building stairs, or around the block. Plan to watch your favorite TV show while on the treadmill or stationary bike.
## Monitoring your Heart Rate Zone with WHOOP
WHOOP measures your heart rate and quantifies the strain your body takes on each day. Each morning, our recovery metric tells you how prepared your body is to take on strain that day, using heart rate variability, respiratory rate, sleep, and resting heart rate.
When you track your workouts with the app’s Strain Target, you can see which heart rate zone you’re training at in real time. You’ll know if you need to turn up the effort or hold back to get into your aerobic heart rate zone.

aerobic-exercise-examples-benefits-and-tips,"Aerobic Exercise: Examples, Benefits and Tips","Regular aerobic activity helps you live longer and healthier. Aerobic exercise – aka cardio – refers to activities performed in a specific heart rate zone. Below we’ll define aerobic exercise, discuss its benefits, provide tips for creating an aerobic training plan, and give you some examples for aerobic workouts you can do at the gym, on the road, or at home.
## What is Aerobic Exercise?
Aerobic means “with oxygen” and aerobic workouts are any form of activity that uses your aerobic metabolism. During aerobic activity, your body metabolizes both fat and carbohydrates (also called glycogen) for energy. In other exercise zones your body may metabolize only fat or only carbs, but during aerobic training you burn both.
When you perform any aerobic activity your respiratory rate increases from about 15 breaths per minute for an average adult at rest to between 40 and 60 breaths. Your heart rate also increases to between 70% and 80% of your maximum heart rate.
Aerobic exercise is performed between 70 and 80% of your maximum heart rate.
Aerobic exercises take advantage of those high heart and respiratory rates by allowing you to move faster, work harder, and get a higher-intensity workout in a shorter amount of time than activities in lower heart rate zones. But they’re not as intense (or as short) as anaerobic activity.
What Does Maximum Heart Rate Mean? Max heart rate is the greatest number of beats per minute (bpm) that your heart can reach when you’re going all-out. It varies from person to person, but it generally changes with age and fitness level.

aerobic-exercise-examples-benefits-and-tips,"Aerobic Exercise: Examples, Benefits and Tips","Aerobic vs Anaerobic Exercise
Your exercise heart rate zone varies depending on the type of workout you’re doing. Running generally takes place in the aerobic heart rate zone, but speed intervals are in the anaerobic zone.
Anaerobic workouts are performed at 80% to 90% of your max heart rate in the anaerobic zone. In this zone your body can’t get enough oxygen to fuel its muscles, so it turns to the glucose found in carbs. Anaerobic training is more intense but much shorter in duration than your average aerobic activity. Both types of exercise are valuable parts to your overall training plans.

Cardio offers several health benefits such as:
Improves cardiovascular health. Aerobic activity strengthens your heart and helps it become more efficient at pumping blood throughout your body. Performing moderate to vigorous-intensity aerobic workouts 3 to 4 times a week can help reduce the risk of heart disease, lower blood pressure, raise “good” HDL cholesterol, and lower “bad” LDL cholesterol.
Managing weight. Combined with a healthy diet, aerobic training helps you burn calories and lose weight or maintain your weight (if that’s your goal).
Sleep better. A regular exercise program combined with sleep hygiene practices can help you sleep better at night. Moderate aerobic activity increases the amount of deep sleep you get, but be aware of how late you work out. Aerobic training causes the body to release chemicals that may keep you awake. Plan your workout to end at least a couple of hours before going to bed to help the endorphin levels even out.
Managing chronic conditions and pain. Low-impact cardio can help reduce and manage chronic back pain and arthritis. It may also help control blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease, according to this study.
Strengthens immune system. Regular physical activity plays a role in keeping you healthy and preventing illness, including respiratory illnesses like COVID-19. Numerous studies have found that working out at a moderate to vigorous intensity for 60 minutes or less optimizes the immune boosting benefits of exercise. However, intense and prolonged workouts can suppress your immune system.",5/24/22

Aerobic exercise has evolved since the spandex-laden aerobics videos of the 80s. One of the best parts of cardio activities is that they can be done almost anywhere, with or without equipment. The American Heart Association recommends that adults perform a minimum of 30 minutes of aerobic activity 5-7 days per week. If 30 minutes is impossible (parents with young children might have trouble getting a half an hour alone), try breaking it up into 10-minute periods. Here are some examples of aerobic workouts you can do at home, outside, and at the gym.
At Home
Squats can be combined with other activities to create an aerobic body weight routine.
Body-weight workouts are easy to do at home because they usually don’t require equipment. Activities including planks, dips, crunches, step-ups, pushups, jump squats, and jogging in place can be combined into a circuit training session of 30-40 minutes with short rests between circuits.
It may come as a surprise to you, but lifting weights can also be aerobic. Cardio weight training may burn more fat in less time than other activities. Use a set of dumbbells heavy enough so you can do 10 to 12 repetitions of upper body exercise. The activities noted above can be completed with or without weights.
Outside
Running and walking are among the numerous aerobic activities you can do outside.
Obviously, running, walking, cycling, roller blading, and swimming laps are aerobic workouts, but you can also go hiking or rucking in a natural setting. Ice skating, rowing, or kayaking on a lake or river are aerobic exercise, as are sports like basketball, hockey, soccer, volleyball, and tennis.

aerobic-heart-rate-zone,What is the Aerobic Heart Rate Zone and How Do You Target it?,"Aerobic Heart Rate Zones by Age Chart
Aerobic heart rate is based on max heart rate for your age, gender and conditioning. A commonly used max heart rate formula is subtracting your age from 220. By this method, the max HR for a 40-year-old is 180 beats per minute (BPM). However, this equation does not consider your specific variables, such as gender, genetics, conditioning, etc.
Individual max heart rate and the aerobic heart rate zone decline as we age.
Other formulas that include more detail (and more math) include the Tanaka formula (208 – 1.7 x age) and the Gulati formula (206 – 0.88 x age, for women only) but these formulas also make broad generalizations and don’t allow for the variables listed above.

### Moderate Aerobic Workouts
Hiking
Cycling
Dancing (such as aerobic dance classes)
Rowing machine
Kayaking and canoeing
In-line and roller skating
Cross-country skiing
Stair climbing and elliptical machine

Chores such as sweeping, vacuuming and mopping can also provide moderate aerobic exercise
### Vigorous Aerobic Workouts
Vigorous aerobic activity occurs when your breath is coming hard and fast and it’s difficult to talk or maintain a conversation with your exercise partner. These workouts consume more oxygen to complete the activity. Examples include:
Running
Swimming
Shoveling snow (use that exercise as a reason to shovel the driveway)
Jumping rope
Carrying heavy loads
Uphill hiking
Cycling more than 10 mph or uphill
Step aerobics
Heavy gardening (think spring gardening with digging, raking leaves, and carrying wheelbarrows of compost)

aerobic-heart-rate-zone,What is the Aerobic Heart Rate Zone and How Do You Target it?,"Aerobic vs Anaerobic Heart Rate Zones
Anaerobic exercise involves short, intense bursts of movement, and burns only carbohydrates for energy. While your body can take in enough oxygen to sustain your activity level during aerobic exercise, anaerobic exercise causes your muscles to need more energy than oxygen can provide. This means your muscles begin breaking down glucose to produce lactic acid.
The target heart rate for anaerobic exercise is between 80% and 90% of your max heart rate. These exercises generally target specific muscle groups, such as biceps, triceps, quads, etc.
This heart rate zone is useful in non-endurance sports and activities that require power output, such as weightlifting, sprinting and interval running, and high intensity interval training (HIIT). An exercise program or training plan that includes aerobic and anaerobic components can help you gain lean muscle mass and burn fat more quickly than just one or the other.
## Measure Your Heart Rate and Know Which Zone You’re In With WHOOP
WHOOP is a heart rate monitor that measures your HR 24/7 and quantifies the strain your body takes on each day, and for specific workouts and activities. When you track your exercise with the app’s Strain Target, you can see your heart rate zones in real time, so you’ll know if you need to hold back or turn it up to get into your target heart rate zone.
Each morning, the WHOOP recovery metric (calculated using heart rate variability, resting heart rate, respiratory rate and sleep) lets you know how prepared your body is to take on strain. The Strain Target then gives you exertion-level recommendations based on your recovery, enabling you to workout for the optimal duration and intensity relative to what your body is ready to handle.",5/27/21
aerobic-heart-rate-zone,What is the Aerobic Heart Rate Zone and How Do You Target it?,"When you work out, how do you tell if you’re getting the most out of a workout? Are you pushing too hard or not hard enough? Targeting your aerobic heart rate zone and exercising at the right intensity can help you maximize the effectiveness of your aerobic workouts and better meet your fitness goals.
## What Does Aerobic Heart Rate Zone Mean?
The word aerobic means “needs oxygen,” and oxygen provides a steady stream of energy to the body during aerobic exercises, or cardio. Aerobic exercise burns both fat and carbohydrates (also called glycogen) for energy. It increases your heart rate for a longer period than other forms of activity. Generally, you use your major muscle groups continuously to bring your heart rate into this zone.
The aerobic heart rate zone is a heart rate between 70% and 80% of your maximum heart rate (MHR). You reach it while exercising at moderate to vigorous intensity. In this zone your breathing quickens, but you’re not out of breath, and you can still have a conversation with a person running next to you. The aerobic heart rate zone is zone three of the five heart rate zones.
Your individual aerobic heart rate zone is a heart rate between 70% and 80% of your max heart rate.
Exercises in this zone are sustainable for long periods of time, at least 40 minutes. Moderate aerobic activities include brisk walking, swimming and mowing the lawn (with a push mower).
At least 150 minutes a week of moderate activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous aerobic activity is recommended by the Department of Health and Human Services. Ramping up to 300 minutes (five hours) or more of moderate aerobic activity, or 150 minutes (2.5 hours) of vigorous aerobic activity has additional health benefits for most people.",5/27/21
alcohol-affects-body-hrv-sleep,"Effects of Alcohol on the Body: Data Insights for HRV, Sleep & More","We all know alcohol isn’t good for you. From things like loss of coordination and concentration in the short term, to liver damage, cardiovascular disease and depression in the long term, the list of potential side effects is quite extensive. However, we’re not going to dive into all that here.
Instead, we’ll break down specifically what we see in WHOOP data–how alcohol directly impacts the performance metrics we track like HRV, resting heart rate, recovery, strain and sleep.
## Effects of Alcohol on Sleep
Many people incorrectly believe that because alcohol is a sedative, it helps them sleep better. What they fail to realize is that it significantly inhibits the quality of their sleep, and not in a good way.
In Episode 43 of the WHOOP Podcast, Alcohol’s Effect on Sleep, Recovery and Performance, our Vice President of Data Science and Research Emily Capodilupo states:
“Sleep is an incredibly active process, our bodies are working really, really hard when we sleep, and if you have alcohol in your system, none of those very active processes can happen.”
Soon after falling asleep your body usually enters a period of deep sleep (also known as slow wave sleep, or SWS), which is the stage of sleep when it restores itself physically (more on this shortly). After that, a typical cycle includes time spent in REM sleep, which is the mentally restorative stage.
But, when your body is sedated and must work to process alcohol in its system while sleeping, it is unable to reach these restorative stages and you get a lot of light sleep instead (learn more about sleep stages and cycles). In that case, even if you sleep for a long time after drinking, you will still fail to wake up feeling rested and recovered.
Additionally, consuming alcohol at night often inhibits behaviors that benefit sleep, like a proper bedtime routine and going to sleep at a regular time (maintaining your circadian rhythm with sleep consistency).",10/16/20
alcohol-affects-body-hrv-sleep,"Effects of Alcohol on the Body: Data Insights for HRV, Sleep & More","WHOOP Recovery: How Alcohol Impacts Your Body’s Readiness to Perform
HRV and resting heart rate are two of the key components of WHOOP recovery (along with sleep and respiratory rate), a measure of how prepared your body is to perform each day.
It should come as no surprise that of all the behaviors available to record in the WHOOP Journal, drinking alcohol is the one with the single greatest negative impact on next-day recovery. On average, WHOOP members’ recovery is 8% lower when they log consuming alcohol the day before (again, this includes everything ranging from one drink to several).
Also important to note, alcohol consumption can continue to affect your body well beyond just the next day. In fact, in a 2016 study of collegiate athletes, we found that the effects of one night of drinking can suppress WHOOP recovery for up to 4-5 days.

## Benefits of Quitting Alcohol Seen in WHOOP Data
In 2019, WHOOP teamed up with Joe Rogan and friends for Sober October, and many of our members joined in to go alcohol free for the month. Across the entirety of our Sober October WHOOP team, we observed a number of improvements in the data. Comparing the 10-day averages prior to the month and at the end, we found each of the following increased:
Sleep Duration: +6 minutes per night
Sleep Performance: +1.28% (sleep achieved vs. sleep needed)
Recovery: +1.58%

alcohol-affects-body-hrv-sleep,"Effects of Alcohol on the Body: Data Insights for HRV, Sleep & More","How Does Alcohol Affect Working Out?
To put it simply, your body is less capable of taking on strain when it isn’t well recovered. And while most athletes are well aware that they won’t perform to their usual standards following a night of drinking, the other side of this equation may come as a bit of a surprise–when you drink in the evening after you work out, you’ll likely fail to see any fitness gains from your exercise that day.
Your body doesn’t actually get stronger or fitter while you’re working out. Strenuous exercise causes micro tears in your muscles and breaks them down. They then repair and regenerate themselves during sleep (slow-wave sleep in particular, when 95% of your human growth hormone is produced). But as discussed above, alcohol in your system prevents you from getting restorative sleep.

## Alcohol and HRV, Resting Heart Rate
Heart rate variability (HRV) and resting heart rate are two of the most useful metrics for quantifying your fitness on a daily basis. Consuming alcohol causes your HRV to drop (bad) and your resting heart to rise (also bad).
With the WHOOP Journal feature, our members are given the option of noting whether or not they have any alcoholic drinks each day. From a Performance Assessment analysis representing everyone on WHOOP, when they report consuming alcohol (even just a single drink) their HRV drops by an average of 7 milliseconds, and their resting heart rate increases by an average of 3 beats per minute.",10/16/20

JP: Yeah, the Giro is insanely hard, with the transfers, the long stages, and the precipitation in the mountains. What else can you add that sets it apart from the Tour de France?
AH: The Tour is very commercial, it’s kind of a pure racer sort of race and a lot of variables get removed. But the Giro is in many ways what cycling used to be. It has huge stages, big transfers, and there’s a lot of chaos–it has the X factor.
JP: At the Tour, I’ve always heard from everyone that it’s extremely high stakes. The first week is wild and intense because everyone wants to take the yellow jersey. It’s super dangerous, like with what we saw last year and those crazy crashes. How is that different at the Giro?
AH: France has a lot of flat roads that they can really take advantage of. They love to throw cross winds in there early and just make it a hectic mess. The counter at the Giro is everybody wants the pink jersey. I mean, it’s without a doubt the best looking jersey in the sport. And they always throw in these nasty little climbing stages early on that totally surprise 95% of the peloton. The only people who know what we’re doing out there are the 4 dudes who live in the little village where you finish stages, on these tiny little roads that if you were to spread your arms out you could almost span the entire width of them–and we’re trying to funnel 180 guys through there.
At the first week of the Tour, you know what’s going to be bad with the wind issues and super high stress. With the Giro, you know something bad is going to happen, but you don’t know what. It doesn’t matter how much you study the course or how much time you spend on Google maps looking at street viewer. I mean they can’t even get the team cars down some of those roads.

As we get geared up for the first Grand Tour of the year, the Giro d’Italia, you’ve raced all of these big 3-week events, can you tell us what makes them each different–the Giro, the Tour de France, and the Vuelta a Espana?
Alex competing in the 2022 Coppi e Bartali and monitoring his Key physiological Metrics with WHOOP.
AH: As they say, the Tour is the Tour, it’s kind of its own big machine, big circus. There’s a lot of stress with the media and stuff. You have all eyes from all around the world watching every mistake you make and every good move you hopefully make. You usually have quite a bit of heat at the Tour as well, and same with the Vuelta.
The Giro is romanticized with the history around it, but the reality is that it’s just hard, and not necessarily in a Watts per kilo sort of way. It’s generally cold, it’s generally wet, you’re racing through the Dolomites in the spring. You’ll see super high WHOOP strain numbers and normally guys still have recoveries in the high yellows and low greens, but it’s harder to do that when you’re hypothermic for nine hours!",5/4/22

JP: What is the last week of a Grand Tour like? You’ve been racing for 14 days and there’s 7 to go, what mentally do you have to switch to get across the finish line?
AH: It’s weird because it kind of goes in both directions. In one sense the human organism can just adjust to almost anything. When you’re in a Grand Tour there’s a point where you feel like, ‘Oh, I’ll just do this forever, this is my life now.’ And it doesn’t matter, it’s fine. But then other times you think ‘I have a fever right now. I’m actually ill,’ and every day you make a new deal with yourself to be able to get to the finish.
JP: How do you feel afterwards? Do you go home and like roll up into a ball, or do you feel like you’ve grown from the race and maybe you’re supercharged?
AH: For the first couple of days after you might wake up at the same time you normally would and think ‘OK, let’s get moving here,’ but then you make some coffee and sit down and just melt into the couch. And not just from the physical exertion, but mentally too, you have no time to switch off during the race.
But yeah, it is strange with the level of fitness that you have from it. In the weeks and months after you have this deep fatigue, where everything sorta hurts and you’re tired all the time. On the other hand, then you get on the bike and you’ll do the best numbers you’ve ever done. It’s a weird balance.",5/4/22

At 34 years old, Alex has raced in the biggest events on the international circuit, including all 3 Grand Tours. WHOOP cycling guru and 4-time national cyclocross champion Jeremy Powers sat down with Alex for a Q&A on the upcoming Giro d’Italia, and what makes it arguably the most difficult race on the planet.
Jeremy Powers: For those who don’t follow cycling closely, riders don’t win often. In fact, some racers will never win after they turn pro. The level of competition in professional road cycling is ridiculously high. It’s been said it’s the hardest, most physically demanding sport in the world. Alex, what do you think of that?
Alex Howes: I think that’s absolutely accurate. The odds in pro cycling are just sort of laughed at. In a soccer match or a football game, you line up and on paper your odds are 50-50. But in cycling, your odds at the start of a race are 1 in 180 maybe. Odds are never in your favor and enduring is just a way of life. I know a lot of riders who have never won anything.",5/4/22

JP: Last question, what should we expect to see in WHOOP data from riders at the Giro this year?
AH: I think it’s going to blow a lot of minds seeing guys go out and put up 20.7 strains for 15 days in a row or something. But I think the thing that’s going to be really interesting is seeing the recovery scores, because generally these riders are in such good shape that they can still bounce back.
And then by the end of the race pretty much everybody’s max heart rate drops about by 10 beats per minute, you just can’t get it up there anymore. And the discrepancy between certain riders will be interesting too, some will have 190 heart rates all day, and then others will be around 140–not related to their fitness, it’s just their physiology.

Killorn suffered an unfortunate season-ending injury in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final.
“I blocked a shot and broke my fibula,” he said. “I played with a broken fibula for three more shifts, but then I couldn’t play any more.” Below you can see the spike in his heart rate just as the injury occurred.
Killorn’s heart rate shot up immediately after blocking a shot and breaking his leg.
Despite skating on a broken leg for several more minutes, Killorn’s heart rate actually remained within its typical range for the rest of his time on the ice.
As might be expected, he slept terribly that night (only 4:57), and his recovery the next day was just 21%.
Eight days later Killorn’s recovery dropped even lower to 4%, although we’re guessing there may have been some other factors involved–his team had just won its second straight Stanley Cup.",10/12/21
alex-killorn-nhl-hockey-heart-rate-sleep,"Stanley Cup Champ Alex Killorn Shares Heart Rate, Strain, Sleep & Recovery from Title-Winning Season","Taking It to the Next Level in the Playoffs
When the postseason began, Killorn doubled down on doing everything he could to boost his sleep and recovery. “In the playoffs we practice a lot less often,” he said. “And when we do it’s usually just a pre-game skate, because rest is so important. You’re not going to really learn anything new or improve on anything system-wise at that point, you want guys to be well rested.”
Killorn elevated his sleep consistency (going to bed and waking up at similar times) from 66% in the regular season to 69% in the playoffs, and upped his daily recovery average 9%. With the intensity of competition heightening as well, his average strain on game days also increased from 17.9 to 18.8.
“During the playoffs I got a rub down before every game too,” he noted. “I have a sauna in my home and I did the sauna a lot more in the playoffs. I had the best playoffs of my career.”
The extra efforts Killorn put in clearly paid off, as his best statistical games of the year came in the postseason.
On May 22, he had a pair of goals and assists in a 6-2 win over Florida, his highest point total (4) of the season. The night before he slept 35 minutes more than his game-day average, and his HRV and RHR were both significantly better than the norm as well. All of this led to a 91% recovery, a great indication that his body was primed to perform.
Killorn’s best game of the year came when his WHOOP stats suggested his body was in great shape to perform.
A few weeks later, Killorn again scored twice and added an assist as his team beat New York 8-0 on June 21. His big game followed a great night of high-quality sleep, consisting of 34% REM and 26% deep sleep (compared to game-day averages of 30% and 23% respectively), as well as fewer disturbances than usual (14 vs. 17).",10/12/21

We answer all the above questions and more, examining his sleep, recovery, strain, and other heart rate metrics during Tampa’s title run, as well as the potential impact they had on his success.
## Season Highs in Sleep, Recovery, HRV & Strain
Spanning the entire 2020-2021 regular season and playoffs, here are Killorn’s top numbers for several key WHOOP metrics.
Alex Killorn’s highest sleep, recovery, strain, and HRV numbers from the 2020-2021 season.
To no surprise, many of these stats have direct correlations to standout performances on the ice. In the next game following his longest night of sleep (8:45 on May 31), Killorn scored a goal in a 2-1 second-round playoff victory over Carolina.
His highest heart rate variability (HRV) of the season came on March 18. He scored that night and was +1 in a 4-2 win vs Chicago (it was also the day he had his lowest/best resting heart rate of the year, 43 beats per minute).
Killorn’s most strenuous day of the year (a 20.5 strain on a 0-21 scale) was June 25, when he assisted on the lone goal in a 1-0 Game 7 victory over New York in the Eastern Conference Finals. It’s no coincidence that was likely the biggest and most intense and stressful game he played in all season.
“This past year I realized how much WHOOP can help me figure things out throughout a season,” he told us. “I wore it every single game.”",10/12/21
alex-killorn-nhl-hockey-heart-rate-sleep,"Stanley Cup Champ Alex Killorn Shares Heart Rate, Strain, Sleep & Recovery from Title-Winning Season","Improving Sleep and Recovery on Game Days
Below you can see Killorn’s averages for a variety of key WHOOP stats on days he had games compared to days he did not. He spent more time in bed and got more sleep prior to game days (as well as a higher percentage of restorative REM sleep), and also saw an increase in heart rate variability and a decrease in resting heart rate.
Killorn posted significantly better WHOOP metrics on game days than he did on off days.
“For me, it’s all about sleep and recovery,” Killorn said. “The more time in bed the better. If my sleep numbers are better my [WHOOP] recovery is typically better too. When we play every other day, my recovery after games is almost never in the green, it’s typically in the yellow. But every day before a game it’s [back] in the green. It typically just goes green-yellow, green-yellow.”
Here’s a two-week sample of his recovery data that illustrates Killorn’s point.
Killorn’s WHOOP recoveries are regularly green prior to games, then take a hit the day after.
Given the high strain of game days (average of 18.1), it makes sense that his recovery tends to dip immediately afterwards. However, it’s quite impressive that Killorn is regularly able to bounce back into the green a day later.
“A lot of times we’ll have optional skates, and [whether I do them or not] will be based on my recovery scores,” he explained. “You obviously want to go out there and improve and work on things, but if my recovery wasn’t great I probably took the optional skates off.”
In addition to decreasing the workload on his body, some of Killorn’s other techniques to benefit sleep and recovery include:
Daily compression boot sessions of about 20 minutes
Naps for 60-80 minutes in the afternoon before games
Saunas followed by cold plunges
Meditation
Post-game rub downs, “a flushing to get the lactic acid out”
Blue-light blocking glasses before bed
Sleeping in a cool room with temperature set at 68 degrees",10/12/21

During games, Killorn’s average heart rate is usually about 130 beats per minute (including the extended breaks between periods), with a max HR of just under 180 bpm. Looking at a sample of his in-game HR data, you can see how it distinctly rises and falls in short bursts around his shifts on the ice, which only last for about 40-45 seconds.
During games Killorn’s heart rate often stays above 125 bpm the entire time, and spikes to around 180 bpm when he’s on the ice.
Even when he’s “resting” on the bench, Killorn’s heart rate rarely falls below 125 bpm.",10/12/21

Bag of pet food / pet supplies
Objects without handles can also be used for some of the “pull” movements listed above, but in general they are great for “push” exercises as well as adding weight for squat or lunge variations. For example, try putting one of the bag items on your shoulder or holding it in front of your chest to add weight for lunges or squats.
Filled water bottles and canned foods of all sizes are great for pressing overhead and bench press variations. Using a tub or protein or other supplement of sturdy nature can be great for push-up variations if you have two of the same size. And let’s not forget about the coveted/loathed ab exercises! Weighted sit-ups, Russian twists, plank pull-throughs, v-sits… how about a side plank while holding a filled water bottle up towards the ceiling with your free hand?!

For the second year in a row, we’re releasing a special edition HFC band for your WHOOP, with 100% of all profits going to support HFC’s mission.
This year’s WHOOP // HFC band features our best-selling ProKnit with the organization’s signature colors, a rainbow hook, and the HFC logo.
Here’s more about HFC’s efforts:
“HFC is accelerating progress in Alzheimer’s care, prevention, and support all while bringing many laughs and light to the Alzheimer’s space. Our movement is also bringing much-needed awareness to this disease through our signature events. We’ve launched a Brain Health Dinner Series, hosted nine star-studded variety shows and one comedian-filled carnival, and have a comedy special currently streaming on Netflix. Thanks to the ongoing support of our generous donors, we’ve raised over $13 million dollars and awarded over 290,000 hours of in-home care relief to Alzheimer’s family caregivers through our North American Caregiver Respite Grant Program. In addition to providing caregiver respite, HFC organizes online support groups to build caregiver community and connectivity, engages young people across the country to become Alzheimer’s advocates, funds prevention-focused and brain-health research, and teaches people how to care for the health of their brains today, so they can reduce their risk tomorrow.”",11/2/20
ama-dr-stacy-sims,Dr. Stacy Sims Answers Members’ Questions on Training and Menstruation,"With regards to HRV, menstrual cycle phase training is something to consider, where you look to do more mobility, functional strength, and recovery work in the late luteal phase (4-5 days before your period starts).
Q. Can you recommend anything to help me balance my recoveries during the 7-10 days before my period, so that practice isn’t as difficult, and I feel less tired?
Sims: The recovery metrics in the late luteal phase will always be in the yellow or red as it is compared to the follicular phase. There is a change in the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which affects HRV, showing reduced recovery in the luteal phase. To help counter the symptoms, however, we need to address the systemic inflammation that comes with the peak then drop of hormones right before your bleed starts.
In this we look at using 1g omega 3 fatty acids (which helps counter prostaglandin E2, the inflammatory cytokine turned “up” by estrogen). Magnesium and zinc are used heavily in the building of, and shedding of, the uterine lining. If you have no adverse responses to aspirin, one 80mg (baby) aspirin counters the inflammatory receptor sites (Cox-1 and Cox-2) and is irreversible (thus keeps those receptor sites muted).
Q. I would like to understand the science behind losing my period during training seasons and how to get it back!
Sims: When you lose your period in hard training it is a sign of a misstep between energy intake and expenditure. Basically, you are not eating to support normal existence (think laying on the couch watching Netflix) and layering on training. You may be eating enough calories, but the timing in and around training might not be there.",12/29/21

ama-dr-stacy-sims,Dr. Stacy Sims Answers Members’ Questions on Training and Menstruation,"Perimenopause, Menopause, and Training
Q: Is there any way to predict hormonal changes during perimenopause or is this just a few years of rollercoasting?
Sims: This is, unfortunately, the offshoot of the changing ratios of estrogen to progesterone in perimenopause. Some cycles there is ovulation, others there is not. This creates times of estrogen dominance, and others of a more balanced hormone profile.
What I usually recommend for women in perimenopause is to track symptoms, sleep, how they are feeling and to change more to 2 weeks “on” with maximum 6 HITT sessions, filling in the other days with heavy resistance training (3-4 per week) and recovery modalities. Then one week “off” where the focus is fully on super slow, low-intensity aerobic work and mobility, functional strength.
Q. I am past having a cycle. Is there still anything I should consider regarding hormones, training, and nutrition?
Sims: If you are now in the post-menopausal phase of life, now is the time to drop the long slow distance and to focus on SIT, HIIT, and heavy resistance training. These training protocols help do what the hormones used to do with regards to blood sugar control, anabolic signaling for lean mass development, and overall blood vessel compliance.",12/29/21
ama-dr-stacy-sims,Dr. Stacy Sims Answers Members’ Questions on Training and Menstruation,"If you do not fuel for what you are doing, your body stays in a breakdown (catabolic) state, this signals the hypothalamus that there is not enough nutrition to support life function and training stress; thus there is signaling to stop gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), stopping the luteinizing pulse and surge, which reduces ovulation, and thus estrogen and progesterone production.
This is called functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (from low energy availability). The first step to getting it back is to see your GP for a referral to an endocrinologist. You need to find out how low your hormones are. In conjunction, fuel for what you are doing! Eat! Especially after all training!
Q. What metrics on WHOOP might be important for someone struggling with amenorrhea?
Sims: What we know from looking at women with amenorrhea vs those who do not, is that there are more sleep disruptions and wake up times due to hypoglycemic episodes; and we see dysfunction in HRV. Meaning that there is significant variability from day to day, not phase to phase.",12/29/21
ama-dr-stacy-sims,Dr. Stacy Sims Answers Members’ Questions on Training and Menstruation,"Advice to Male Coaches
Q. What’s the best advice you could give male coaches to help them support their female clients better?
Sims: One of the biggest elephants is actually broaching the topic of menstrual cycle status as a male coach. To help with this, we know including simple questions in general wellness check-in is successful. It comes across as a simple health question. Understanding if your female athlete is naturally cycling (and what are the patterns), on any birth control (hormonal or not), perimenopausal, or post-menopausal can enhance the coach’s ability to dial in training loads and improve the performance potential at any life stage.
But, it has to begin with an open conversation to understand where your athlete is. And taking the angle of health = performance is the best means of breaking down the taboo.",12/29/21
ama-dr-stacy-sims,Dr. Stacy Sims Answers Members’ Questions on Training and Menstruation,"Training and the Menstrual Cycle
Q. Can you elaborate on cycle-syncing workouts and nutrition?
Dr. Stacy Sims: In the low-hormone phase our bodies are resilient to stress. This is the time to do high-intensity workouts, heavy resistance training, and recover well. Around ovulation, estrogen is anabolic by itself, thus with the estrogen surge, another high-intensity, heavy resistance training session is the way to go.
After ovulation, with metabolic shifts and the increasing levels of progesterone and estrogen, it is time to dial it back a bit into more steady state/aerobic type work, and moderate resistance training. In the last few days leading into your next period, this is the time to recover — absorb the hard training from the previous 3ish weeks, and look to do more technique, mobility, and functional strength work (not take the days off, unless you want to).
Nutritionally, in the low hormone phase, we can access carbohydrates pretty well, so in recovery, think about increasing carbohydrate intake to help restore glycogen in the muscle and liver. After ovulation, there is a metabolic shift where your body relies more on blood glucose and cannot access liver and muscle glycogen (estrogen and progesterone reduce the ability of the body to release it).
Progesterone’s job is to break down protein, carbohydrates, and fats to provide building blocks for the uterine lining that is being built. So, your body is in a constant breakdown state. In this state, you want to increase your daily intake of carbohydrates across all meals to “level the hormone playing field” to have carbs available for training and general movement. It’s very important to boost your protein intake to hit around 30g per meal, and 30g post exercise, to stop that continuous breakdown state.
Q. What is your advice for planning training on bleeding days?",12/29/21
ama-dr-stacy-sims,Dr. Stacy Sims Answers Members’ Questions on Training and Menstruation,"Sims: Physiologically, your body is primed to hit it hard, but psychologically our own lived experiences can impact how we feel about training/exercising on bleeding days. If you are experiencing heavy cramping and bleeding, just move–movement helps reduce the inflammation causing the cramping.
If you are hesitant to hit it hard, due to experiences or the prevailing thought that women should not train hard during their periods, try a few short bursts (sprint interval training). Something like 5-8x 20 seconds all out, 2 minutes cruise between, then call it. The super-intense work will increase post-exercise anti-inflammatory responses, release endorphins, and because it is short it is not as taxing mentally or physically as doing a full structured workout.
Q. Is caffeine helpful with cramps like it can be for headaches, or not so much?
Sims: Not so much. The cramping associated with menses are super strong uterine (muscular) contractions to expel the dying tissue. It is not like a headache that is more due to blood vessel constriction.",12/29/21
ama-dr-stacy-sims,Dr. Stacy Sims Answers Members’ Questions on Training and Menstruation,"Birth Control and Training
Q. Do you have any advice for how to train and support your body as you come off birth control and start having a natural cycle?
Sims: Track!! It usually takes around 3-4 months for your body to find its natural cycle rhythm again after coming off oral contraceptives. Tracking how you feel with HRV, and other recovery metrics will help you find a good pattern to dial in days to hit it hard and days to dial it back.
Read about the WHOOP Health Monitor and how WHOOP tracks your recovery.
Q. I recently switched to a low progesterone/low estrogen birth control pill (from Nexplanon), and I noticed that my HRV numbers have tanked, but they are also more consistent. Is this expected?
Sims: First to note, when you are using the pill (any dose), you are not having a natural period, but a withdrawal bleed. The hormones in the pill downregulate your own hormones through ovarian suppression, and these hormones also have a systemic effect, which is what we found in the recent article we published on the differences between natural, oral contraceptive, and progestin-only birth control.
As the synthetic hormones build up (e.g., each week of the active pills), there is a greater impact on the ANS, increasing sympathetic activating, and reducing parasympathetic control. This is what you are seeing with your HRV change. There is less parasympathetic activation, thus a baseline increase in your resting heart rate, respiratory rate, and a decrease in the variability between heart rate (hence decreased HRV); but it is more stable, because you have a stable hormone profile with the oral contraceptive.
The implant is a slow release of progestin, with an initial suppression of follicular development and estrogen production. After about 6-8 months, this suppression reduces, thus ovulation can occur–evident in the difference between the oral contraceptive HRV and the Nexplanon HRV (more variability of the ANS).",12/29/21
ama-dr-stacy-sims,Dr. Stacy Sims Answers Members’ Questions on Training and Menstruation,"Recovery and the Menstrual Cycle
Q. I would love to know the science behind why recoveries are significantly better during your period.
Sims: In the low-hormone phase, there is less hormone-driven sympathetic drive, thus our bodies are more resilient to stress. After ovulation, with the rise in progesterone, there is a sympathetic dominance, reducing the ability to get into a parasympathetic state. Training during your period is one of the best ways to use your hormones to your advantage! Women can access carbohydrates well and hit high intensities and recover from that training stimulus quickly because of the resilience to stress.
Our immune systems are also more resilient before ovulation—all of this is the biological “eye” of getting the body to the best possible condition to support a fertilized egg. Don’t let the myths perpetuated by the historic marginalization of women get to you! If you feel like hitting it hard, go for it! Your body can handle it and your training potential will thank you.
Q. I would like to find out more about how the different phases of the menstrual cycle affects HRV and sleep. And whether there is anything we can do to mitigate the effects?
Sims: In the low hormone (follicular) phase HRV is highest, REM and SWS are easy to attain, and sleep efficiency is great. But after ovulation, as progesterone rises, there is a change. Progesterone stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, thus increasing resting heart rate, respiratory rate, reducing HRV, and reducing the ability to get into the parasympathetic state needed for REM and SWS.
Estrogen also comes into play during the luteal phase, by working with progesterone to suppress REM and increase wakeful episodes. To help in the luteal phase, especially the late luteal phase, good sleep hygiene practices are essential.",12/29/21
ama-kristen-holmes-heart-rate-variability,AMA Recap: VP of Performance Kristen Holmes on Heart Rate Variability,"Does an increased HRV month over month mean you’re actually getting fitter? And vice versa, does a decreased HRV mean you are less fit? As a crossfit athlete, I go through cycles where I am focused more on strength than cardiovascular training and wonder how I can interpret my HRV during these different cycles. – Stephanie A.
A recent study by Daniel Plews and colleagues found that training phases of high intensity (e.g., above the second lactate threshold) suppressed HRV, while phases of lower intensities (e.g., below the lactate threshold) increased HRV. When interpreting an HRV trend over time, it is key to understand how different types of training will impact HRV in different ways, and as a result not always yield a higher HRV and the end of a training block.
Phases involving moderate intensity aerobic work are likely to cause an increasing HRV trend, while phases of high intensity conditioning with minimal low intensity work will cause a decrease. The absence of low intensity aerobic work results in an absence of the stimulatory effects that this training type has on parasympathetic activity. Additionally, the high intensity training will be more disruptive to homeostasis as a result of greater metabolic demand. In this situation, a progressive decrease in HRV can occur despite no meaningful increase in levels of fatigue.
So, you shouldn’t be alarmed if you observe a decrease in your HRV trend when limiting moderate aerobic work. The best way to test whether your training block was effective is to take a “deload” or taper week, crush lifestyle (long walks, clean food, lots of water, meet sleep need, connect with friends, engage in breathwork, ROMWOD, etc) and see what happens to HRV.",4/14/21
ama-kristen-holmes-heart-rate-variability,AMA Recap: VP of Performance Kristen Holmes on Heart Rate Variability,"Why do some people of the same age have significant differences in HRV? – Fredrik F.
From an article on our blog titled What is a Good HRV? It Varies for Everyone:
“The most important thing to know with HRV is that it is an incredibly personalized metric that differs greatly from one individual to the next. When attempting to figure out what is a good heart rate variability for you, a number of factors such as age, gender, fitness level, lifestyle, environment and genetics must be taken into account. … For the most part, younger people have higher HRV than older people, and males may have slightly higher HRV than females. Additionally, elite athletes (endurance athletes in particular) tend to have greater heart rate variability than non-athletes. However, what represents a healthy HRV varies for everybody. There are many exceptionally fit people who have heart rate variability that is lower than the norm.”

### Do certain types of medications, for example anti-anxiety medications, affect HRV? – Anthony Philippe S.
In principle, be aware that medication (in general) is one of the most common artificial influencers of heart rate variability. It is important to understand that because most medications treat symptoms instead of the underlying disease or illness, these medications might artificially increase HRV while masking the deeper autonomic function and health of an individual.
In regard to medication, higher HRV values do not automatically mean that you are healthier. If you are taking a medication and your HRV is significantly lower or higher than your demographic, you should consider that your HRV might be artificially skewed. In a study by O’Regan et al, results suggest that reductions in HRV can be driven by the effects of antidepressant medications.",4/14/21
ama-kristen-holmes-heart-rate-variability,AMA Recap: VP of Performance Kristen Holmes on Heart Rate Variability,"Why do some top athletes have low HRV? Are there ever any weird situations where one branch (sympathetic vs parasympathetic) dominating and resulting in lower HRV can actually be beneficial? – Chris K
Great question! Hang with me, this will take a minute. The assumption that HRV alone can predict physiological readiness to perform relies on a direct linear relationship between HRV and R-R interval length–and therefore a direct relationship between HRV and fitness. In most early studies investigating HRV and performance, the subjects observed were only recreationally fit and noted that this assumption does not generalize to elite athletes with a history of a high training load.
For elite athletes with lower resting heart rates, decreases in HRV have been observed. This has been attributed to two processes. The first is a decrease in parasympathetic activity that has been observed to occur with reductions in training load (i.e. tapering). This may also be connected to increased sympathetic activity that comes from pre-competition stress. The second process, known as “parasympathetic saturation,” reflects the saturation of acetylcholine receptors at the myocyte level. A heightened vagal tone then causes longer parasympathetic control and therefore decreases HRV. Generally speaking, the relationship between RHR and HRV is quadratic rather than linear.

ama-kristen-holmes-heart-rate-variability,AMA Recap: VP of Performance Kristen Holmes on Heart Rate Variability,"Why is HRV a significant metric in tracking fitness/wellness compared to other physiologic measures? – Oksana C.
Daily measures of HRV can help you learn things about yourself that you didn’t know before, such as how much sleep you really need, how travel affects your recovery, and just how many glasses of wine is one too many! Like any metric though, it is not the complete answer. By recording subjective indicators in the WHOOP Journal you can build a contextual picture that will enable you to see what works best for you, and you can keep applying those marginal gains for sustained performance for years to come.
### Is it bad if HRV decreases after a rest day? Shouldn’t rest improve it? – Rajeev M.
It isn’t bad. It just means that your body is still working to adapt to the stress you put on it. “Rest” in theory will improve HRV, but remember that in addition to exercise, HRV is also influenced acutely by hormonal reactions, sleep, metabolic processes, breathing, diet, social connection, cognitive processes, and mental stress. So even though you are doing your best to “rest,” these other factors could be slowing your adaptation. Be patient, focus on lifestyle factors you can control and HRV should bounce back. More on this later…

### What are the most common misconceptions about HRV? – Fern Y.
1) That you can’t modify it. You can (see Question 1 above for my top 3 tips).
2) HRV doesn’t tell me any more than my resting heart rate (RHR). Wrong… Although an elevated RHR has been used as an indicator of pending overtraining, it is a blunt instrument, and by the time it is elevated the damage often has already been done.
3) Daily changes in HRV reflect the previous day’s training volume. A hard session will affect your HRV, but things are rarely that simple, and if they were you wouldn’t need HRV. Sleep, non-activity strain, and psychological stress all influence today’s capacity.",4/14/21
ama-kristen-holmes-heart-rate-variability,AMA Recap: VP of Performance Kristen Holmes on Heart Rate Variability,"What are your thoughts on meditation to improve HRV? – Richard T.
When you are highly alert and want to be calm, meditation (if you are good at) can be an effective intervention. To me, meditation is very non-specific and for most people difficult to do. I prefer interventions such as Resonance Frequency breathing as it has been shown to be the most effective at mediating HRV. Physiological sighs (double inhale and long exhale) have also been shown to calm the nervous system.

### What role do calories play in HRV or overall recovery? Regardless of vegan, paleo, meat-based eating approaches, I’d love to know if operating at a deficit to change body composition reduces recovery. – Grace P.
Too few calories, or too many calories, is generally bad for HRV. A simple way to improve HRV is to eat meals at regular times and within a restricted feeding window (8-10 hours). Research over the past decade has revealed an intimate relationship between eating in sync with circadian rhythms and metabolic processes. Generally speaking, eat when it is light out, avoid eating when it is dark out, and aim to fast for at least 12 hours overnight (your body needs at least that to function properly).

If you’re not already familiar with the basics, we highly recommend reading our Ultimate Guide to HRV.
### If I could only do three things to improve my HRV, what would you recommend? – Alex T.
1) Sleep well & consistently. Getting all the sleep your body needs is a great start, but equally as important is making an effort to go to sleep and wake up at regular times each day. Sleep consistency will boost your HRV by helping to sustain your circadian rhythm, and also enables you to spend more time in REM and deep sleep.
2) Pick your moments to drink alcohol. We’ve found that when WHOOP members report consuming alcohol, their HRV drops by an average of 22 milliseconds the next day and can suppress your heart rate variability for 4-5 days.
3) Get outside in the natural light within 20 minutes after waking up in the morning (and prior to 9 am), and watch the sky change from light to dark in the evening. Natural light triggers biological processes involved with regulating sleep/wake times (see sleep consistency above), energy levels and hormone production. This will also improve alertness, mood and vitamin D production, ability to lose weight, and increase capacity to train, to name a few!

Because there are so many factors that influence HRV and it is so variable during the day, it is a difficult marker to interpret (see Sam’s question below for a more in-depth answer). Hopefully in the future we will show HRV as a feedback mechanism during breathwork sessions.
### Why does WHOOP calculate HRV Primarily during your last SWS/deep sleep stage each night? – Sam P.
Slow wave sleep (SWS, also known as deep sleep) is a stable state that, in contrast to wake (or even other stages of sleep), is unaffected by internal and external factors. It is a reproducible state that allows a reliable determination of HRV. Deep sleep towards the back-end of sleep is when your body is most at rest and provides the cleanest conditions to take a reading that best reflects how it has adapted to the previous day’s stressors. Taking your unweighted average across all sleep would include a lot of variance as well as conditions that are not as ideal for calculating HRV, leading to less reliable data and a baseline that’s not as meaningful.
### Can I expect my HRV to go up significantly as I get in better shape? – Laurent R.
Yes, baseline HRV should improve as you become more fit. That said, be sure to observe the HRV trend in the context of sport and lifestyle demands and behaviors (i.e., training load, relationship load, diet, sleep, etc). This context will help you better determine the meaning of the change and then you can adjust training or lifestyle factors if necessary according to the goal of the current training phase.

app-feature-improve-sleep-efficiency,"Sleep Efficiency: What is It, How Do You Stack Up & How Can You Improve?","Average Sleep Efficiency
Let’s start off by answering a frequently asked question: What’s normal? We pulled the 1-million most recent sleeps recorded by our WHOOP users and plotted them below:
The graph above shows that the average Sleep Efficiency on WHOOP is 94.4%, meaning that for a typical 8-hour time in bed, the average WHOOP user is getting 7 hours and 33 minutes of actual sleep. This value is consistent with what academic sleep literature suggests given that the typical WHOOP user is young and fit, two characteristics which are known to be correlated with increased Sleep Efficiency. For a great review of the topic, check out this 2016 article by Drs. Michael Scullin and Donald Bliwise.
Since typical Sleep Efficiency varies quite a bit across demographics, we share some of the breakdowns:
Among WHOOP users, age is highly correlated with Sleep Efficiency, and displays an expected decline as users move from the youngest to oldest age groups. In fact, WHOOP users lose an average of about 1 percentage point of sleep efficiency per decade of added age.
Females on WHOOP sleep more efficiently than males on WHOOP in the youngest and oldest age groups, and sleep marginally less efficiently in their 20s, 30s, and 40s. Interestingly, female Sleep Efficiency is dramatically better than male Sleep Efficiency in our oldest age groups.",2/25/19
app-feature-improve-sleep-efficiency,"Sleep Efficiency: What is It, How Do You Stack Up & How Can You Improve?","Sports, Exercise, and Sleep Efficiency
Day Strain and Sleep Efficiency have an interesting relationship, shown below, in which Sleep Efficiency peaks roughly around a Day Strain of 14 and declines for the lowest and highest Strains. For those readers not familiar with WHOOP, a Strain of 14 is roughly what we expect when a well-trained athlete runs 10k at a moderate effort.
Academic literature confirms that this pattern should be expected, as it’s been studied in both younger and older individuals. While most of the literature focuses on the differences in Sleep Efficiency following no-exercise vs light exercise days (the rise in Sleep Efficiency as Strain increases from 4 to 14), there is also literature supporting the decline in Sleep Efficiency seen when exercise intensity is greatest (the sharper fall as Strain increases beyond 18). One 2011 study demonstrated that following extreme exhaustive exercise, catecholamine (stress hormone) levels are increased and may remain increased for as many as two days, a change that could certainly impact sleep quality.
After looking at Sleep Efficiency and the previous day’s Day Strain, we next looked at how Sleep Efficiency varies among different types of athletes, specifically, by their primary sport (the activity they log most frequently on WHOOP). On average, soccer players are the most efficient sleepers and within our 15 most-popular sports, walkers and elliptical users are the least efficient.
While the below graph may suggest something interesting about the physiology of those who are best suited for one sport vs another, it is worth mentioning that the actual Sleep Efficiency experienced by a given user is more strongly determined by age, gender, frequency and intensity of exercise, and individual behavioral choices than it is by their primary sport.",2/25/19

Use a weighted blanket.
Snuggle your dog. This one surprisingly came up multiple times, so we looked into it. According to one study, having dogs in the bed increased perceived sleep quality by providing feelings of comfort and security. Interestingly, that same study found that sharing a bed with a human decreased perceived sleep quality.
Take a bath.
Turn off your phone. Several of our top sleepers weren’t willing to go that far but recommended turning it upside down so it doesn’t light up and disturb your sleep.

Make sure your bedroom is dark enough that you can’t see your fingers when you hold your hand out in front of you.
Remove or cover up all electronics with those pesky LEDs. While they seem insignificant, it takes as little as 80 lux for your brain to receive “daytime” signals that can inhibit sleep.
Consider investing in blackout curtains if the light is coming from outside.
### BANISH SOUND
BANISH SOUND
Ensure your room is quiet, or consider earplugs if you can’t remove the noise. One study showed that even relatively low levels of noise decrease sleep quality.
### TIMING IS EVERYTHING
TIMING IS EVERYTHING
Increasing blue light exposure during the day helps keep your circadian rhythm on track, making it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep at night. As a bonus, this will also help with daytime alertness and performance.
Conversely, cut out blue light exposure in the evening since increased alertness is no longer what you are after.
Consider blue light blocking glasses and/or blue light blocking filters for your screened devices. Better yet, turn off those screens completely at least 2 hours before bed.",2/25/19

THINK TWICE ABOUT WHAT GOES IN YOUR MOUTH
Cut out the caffeine at least 7 hours before bedtime. This not only includes obvious sources like coffee, but also less obvious sources like certain breakfast cereals.
Don’t eat too much too close to bed. Going to bed with a full stomach can decrease sleep quality and increase sleep latency.
Consider sleep-promoting foods and drinks like cherry juice and herbal teas, such as chamomile.
### SET THE MOOD
SET THE MOOD
A nighttime ritual helps your body power down.
Consider meditating or journaling to clear your mind of thoughts that might be keeping you awake.
Set aside clothes just for sleep. Sleeping in that old t-shirt from college or the undershirt you wore to work sends mixed signals. Having “just for sleep” clothes helps set a tone your sleep hormones understand.
Maintain the sanctity of your bed; if you bring your work into bed with you (even just that one last email you have to write), you tell your body that bed is for work. Since you would never want to fall asleep at work, your body rallies to stay awake–very counterproductive.",2/25/19
app-feature-improve-sleep-efficiency,"Sleep Efficiency: What is It, How Do You Stack Up & How Can You Improve?","Regional Differences in Sleep Efficiency
Sleep Efficiency doesn’t just vary in expected ways, such as with age, but also shows some unexpected variation across geographic regions. We looked at the differences among our domestic and international users for our 12 most-represented countries.
We see in the graph above that European WHOOP users are generally sleeping more efficiently than are those of us in the United States and Canada.
## Sleep Efficiency Temporal Patterns
Finally, in conducting the above analysis, we found that Sleep Efficiency, at least within the WHOOP user base, displays cyclical variation.
The graph above shows the WHOOP average daily Sleep Efficiency for the last 4 months. There’s a 7-day repeating pattern in which Sleep Efficiency is higher during the work weeks than on the weekends. This pattern can also be seen by binning the data by day of week (below). One thing we found amusing was how the cyclical pattern, which is very strong throughout October and November, breaks down around Thanksgiving and again during the holiday season in late December through New Years.
If we look at time in bed and hours of sleep (below), we see almost the opposite pattern from what we saw with Sleep Efficiency–greater sleep duration and time in bed are experienced on the weekend days. This likely explains the above trend in Sleep Efficiency because, as is demonstrated in a 1996 article published in Sleep, when users sleep late, the extended portion of their sleep tends to be less efficient than the earlier part of the night. It is therefore likely that the beginning of the users’ sleeps on weekends start out roughly equally efficient to any other night, but as they extend sleep past typical wake up times, Sleep Efficiency decreases sufficiently to bring down the overall average for the night.",2/25/19

When you tap on your hours of sleep, either from the main overview page or the sleep page, you get an upgraded analysis of all the key details of last night’s sleep (if you don’t see this yet you will in the next few weeks).
## What’s New
To start, we added a very popular request from our members: Your sleeping heart rate graphic now displays the time of day you are asleep, as opposed to the duration of time you spend sleeping.
Additionally, you can see the percentage of time spent in each stage of sleep, along with your typical range for each (based on the past 30 days). Plus the trends over time in your restorative sleep for a closer look at how much you’re getting and when.
Tapping on any of the sleep stages gives you the full breakdown of that stage, as well as further analysis and a comparison to your recent average.
At the bottom of the page you’ll find your sleep metrics, in the same format as what’s featured in the health monitor with your baseline range for each. Included are wake events (formerly disturbances) per hour, sleep efficiency, respiratory rate, and sleep latency (the time it takes you to fall asleep–this only appears if you manually set the time you go to bed).

are-nfl-players-prone-to-overtraining,Are NFL Players Prone to Overtraining?,"Four days after the draft, Matt reported to Rookie Minicamp. He explained that the surreal moment was when he stepped on the field and saw his childhood heroes playing catch right next to him. He looked across the field and saw Dez Bryant, Jason Witten, and Tony Romo – guys that, up to this moment, he had only seen on TV.
One thing that Matt mentioned is that he looked forward to finally putting on the widely recognized “star” that made the Cowboys recognizable. But as he got to his locker, the helmet sitting there was blank and logo-less. Jason Garrett’s mantra is that you have to earn your star before you can wear it on your helmet.
If you haven’t yet realized this, Matt has unmatched fortitude. He’s someone who takes it upon himself to push his body and his physical ability to the next level. He’s always been this way, and if you asked him that question, he would agree. Matt’s a grinder – like most NFL players. However, that “grinding” mentality took a toll on Matt’s ability to play at full health his first season.
At Matt’s first practice, he tweaked his hamstring which caused him to miss most of his rookie training camp. During that recovery period, he spent every second trying to get back on the field. After hours and hours of extensive rehab trying to heal his hamstring, Matt finally got back to the field where he put his helmet on (with the star) and started the second preseason game for the Cowboys.
The Cowboys were playing the Rams and Matt, back to full strength, demonstrated to the coaches why they drafted him by having a stellar first preseason game.",10/3/16
are-nfl-players-prone-to-overtraining,Are NFL Players Prone to Overtraining?,"Matt and his identical twin brother Zach were – and are – inseparable. They talk daily and confide every detail about their life with each other. Their younger sister, Gabrielle, is 5 years younger than Matt and Zach and is an impressive volleyball player.
In high school, Matt was a standout athlete in football, baseball, track & field and basketball. His twin brother, Zach, and his sister, Gabrielle, were both right there with him – both talented standouts.
As a twin, the bond that Matt and Zach share is infrangible.
“Zach is my best friend. We were very lucky growing up with that kind of relationship. When looking back, the nice thing is, sometimes when you have a twin, one is a little better than the other in whatever they do. For us, we were the same. We’d take turns at getting better. One year I would get a little bit better, then the following year he would. My Junior year in football I was a little better than he was, and in our Senior year, he was a little better. No matter who was better at what point, we always supported each other. We were always each other’s best friend regardless if I had a terrible game and he had five touchdowns.”
Football wasn’t Matt’s first love. Early on, Matt had an affinity for baseball. Matt was on a prestigious baseball club from 6th grade to his sophomore year of high school.
“To be honest at that time the both of us thought we were going to be playing baseball forever. We loved baseball, but we knew we weren’t the best at it and we weren’t going to play anytime after high school, but we loved it.”
After countless baseball tournaments, and endless days perfecting his swing, football started to slowly enter Matt’s life.
When Matt was young, his father would show both Matt and Zach tapes of Emmitt Smith juking opponents and breaking tackles. In between baseball practices and games, they would sit in their living room and watch every second of #22’s time on the field.",10/3/16
are-nfl-players-prone-to-overtraining,Are NFL Players Prone to Overtraining?,"“It was crazy. It feels like it is a dream when I talk about it. Looking back, my dad, Zach and I talk about certain games and certain plays that happened. I had an interception called back; one of our linemen jumped offside. I had a couple pass breakups. I played pretty solid. But it wasn’t just me, we had a bunch of people step up that game. My brother had a HUGE sack on the second to last play that sealed the deal for us.”
After winning the National Championship, Matt began flying all over the country visiting and working out with various NFL organizations. The fact that he never missed a tackle or an assignment made scouts take notice. Matt met with the Chicago Bears, Dallas Cowboys, Houston Texans, and the New England Patriots. Each team flew him out for workouts and chalkboard sessions where they would test his mental understanding and intuitiveness of the game.
The day of the draft, Matt and his family rented a hotel room in Cheney. It was the only hotel in Cheney at the time.
His dad, mom, brother, brother’s girlfriend (now wife), sister, and his high school mentor all huddled around the TV as Roger Goodell took the stage at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City on April 26th at 8pm.
“I got the call. It was a Dallas number. I picked up and said, ‘Hello?’ The voice on the other end asked, ‘Is this Matt?’ I said, ‘Yup.’ He goes, ‘This is Jerry Jones.’ Just to get everyone’s attention in the room I said, ‘Hello Mr. Jones.’ It was the last pick of the 4th round and he said, ‘We have a pick coming up and we’re taking you. The coaches enjoyed your visit and they really liked working out with you. We think you have a bright future here.’”
“That was a moment I’ll never forget.”
After Jerry hung up, Matt was bombarded by reporters. His life was about to change.
Matt Johnson, Dallas Cowboys, #37",10/3/16
are-nfl-players-prone-to-overtraining,Are NFL Players Prone to Overtraining?,"If you’ve ever played sports, I can almost guarantee that at one point in your childhood you pictured yourself playing for your favorite professional team. Personally, I always believed that one day I would be the starting catcher for the Boston Red Sox. I used to drape an old paint tarp in my parent’s open garage door, dial the radio to Joe Castiglione, and throw baseballs into the loosely waving gray cloth that protected my dad’s tool bench from getting plunked. Baseball by baseball, Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter, I wore that old tarp out. However, after all those years, the Red Sox never called – the phone never rang. My dream of playing for the Red Sox never came true.
For Matt Johnson, this typical childhood story had a different outcome… When the time came, his phone rang.
Matt is a soft spoken, humble, family man, that during our interview never once boasted about his records or bragged about his achievements. With every compliment I sent his way, he deflected it to either his teammates or his family. As the conversation went on, I started to notice that everything Matt was saying was stated as “we” or “our.” The word “I” is absent from his vocabulary. It was refreshing having a conversation with someone who has every right to brag, yet never mentioned any of it.
His humble beginnings started in Tumwater Washington. While speaking with Matt, it’s abundantly clear that above all else his love for his family is fervid.
Matt’s father is a stern, yet supportive figure that permeates respect when he enters the room. He’s the type of man that does everything he can to provide for his family and make sure all their needs and wants were fulfilled. His mother is a loving role model that no matter what instills confidence and love in her three children.",10/3/16
are-nfl-players-prone-to-overtraining,Are NFL Players Prone to Overtraining?,"“The biggest area sports scientists are attempting to understand is athlete recovery,” says Gary McCoy, SVP of Applied Sports Science for WHOOP. “This is where WHOOP data is essential to the elite athlete. With Sleep-Lab accuracy, WHOOP is just starting to uncover the correlations between sleep and performance, recovery and injury prevention, and even recovery and athlete adaptation. WHOOP technology is the gateway to athlete diagnostic data that has never been seen before. However, WHOOP technology and data is not the hero in this evolution. The coach who accurately prescribes practice, conditioning, recovery, and rest based on this data, will be the architect of this athlete evolution.”
Matt is now back in Washington and lives with his wife and three Labrador Retrievers (one in each color). He is a trainer at a local gym and recently finished his science degree from Eastern Washington (he still had 4 classes left when he was drafted).
Matt is on WHOOP and uses the data to help monitor his recovery in order to make sure he works out on the day’s that he is best recovered.
Got a good recovery with @whoop and about to get this workout in! #optimalperformance

are-nfl-players-prone-to-overtraining,Are NFL Players Prone to Overtraining?,"After battling hamstring issues during the previous years, he suffered another hamstring injury in 2014 which kept him out of preseason. On August 27th of that year, Matt was placed on the Injured Reserve list again, before being released with an injury settlement on September 3, 2014.
It’s shocking to think that after everything Matt went through and after everything that he invested in the game, that a promising career like his came to a halt because of overtraining.
In most practices, the NFL uses GPS-based monitors on the shoulder pads of each player to measure how far and how fast each athlete runs. This measurement is also used in addition to how each coach perceives each athlete is “feeling” that day. Coaches base a lot of their decisions on gut, rather than data.
Off the field, Matt told us that each athlete, starting last year in training camp, measured their heart rate when they woke up with the general Health App on the iPhone.
“They would take their heart rate when they went to bed and when they got up. The NFL is starting to realize that you can’t guess at how well recovered their players are,” Matt said. Yes, this is true, and yes they’re moving in the right direction, but the NFL needs to do more to make sure their players are well recovered during the week. By utilizing WHOOP data, coaches and players can now create real-time training plans based on how well each athlete is Recovered during any given day.",10/3/16
are-nfl-players-prone-to-overtraining,Are NFL Players Prone to Overtraining?,"However, during the next week of practice, Matt tweaked his hamstring again, putting him out for much longer. Not knowing the cause initially, the Cowboy doctors eventually figured out that it was a back issue. Matt’s back was causing his left and right hamstrings to weaken. The team had high expectations that he would earn the starting Free Safety position his rookie year so they put him on the Active Roster for the first 6-7 weeks of his Rookie year. After his injury persisted, the Cowboys put him on Injured Reserve for the rest of the season. Matt’s only field time was that one preseason game against St. Louis.
The next year, Matt was ready to compete. During the entire off-season, Matt pushed his body and trained harder than ever before in order to make sure he was ready to win the Safety position.
“I figured, I’m a football player. Everyone is sore. Everyone is in pain. So I trained and trained. I wanted to prove myself. I wanted to play.”
Then the worst came. Matt broke his foot.
“It was beyond frustrating because I did everything I could to come into camp healthy and ready to complete, but if I knew what I knew now, I probably wouldn’t have trained as hard as I did.”
Matt’s referring to his training load. He admits that overtraining was the reason he got injured.
“My original thought is that if I’m getting hurt, it’s because I’m not strong enough, or I didn’t train enough. There has to be something that I can do that will help me improve. I guarantee that if I had the technology and knew about WHOOP when I was in the league, I would have had a chance to play more.”
It’s typical for professional athletes, especially NFL players who need to fulfill their “tough guy” reputation, to overtrain in order to compensate for the weaknesses in their game. In Matt’s case, his injuries were his weakness and working out harder to overcome these weaknesses was his presumed remedy.",10/3/16
are-nfl-players-prone-to-overtraining,Are NFL Players Prone to Overtraining?,"Without skipping a beat, Matt’s redshirt freshman year (his sophomore academic year) was instantly one to remember. He was second on the team in pretty much every defensive category and proved that he belonged on the field. The following year, during his redshirt sophomore season, he led the league in every defensive category.
Then in his Junior year, everything started to change… in a slow way.
For most athletes that move up the ranks, the game gets faster as the level of play rises. For Matt, the opposite happened. As he stepped into his Junior year, the pace of the game slowed. The running seemed slower, the passes were in the air longer, and the blockers lost their strength. Matt was living in this “bizarro world” where the game speed seemed slower.
It started to feel like high school again for Matt, and that familiar feeling of playing at the next level started to become a reality. It was at that point that he knew he could play in the NFL.
During the first six games of his Junior season, Matt didn’t miss a tackle and he didn’t miss an assignment. His coach would always joke with him, “Are you going to mess up today?”
I asked Matt what lead to that large jump in talent. Why did he all of a sudden excel in this sport? Matt credited his success to his two coaches, Tori Hunter and Nate Brookreson.
“Tori taught me all the little things about being a safety. He taught me how to make the right reads during pre-snap and post-snap. His biggest thing was ‘no wasted movements.’ Once you get to an elite level, any wasted movement is detrimental – you’re going to get beat. We also had a great coach in Nate Brookreson. He was the best trainer I’ve ever had. Every summer we would go into camp ready to go. I felt strong, I felt ready, and I felt prepared to take on my competition.”
The combination of coaches and talented players like Matt led to something special during his Junior year. Matt and the rest of his team won the Division 1 AA National Championship.",10/3/16
are-nfl-players-prone-to-overtraining,Are NFL Players Prone to Overtraining?,"Since Matt grew up in a pro-Cowboy household, it wouldn’t have been kosher to root for any other team. So by default, Matt rooted for the Cowboys.
“After watching Emmit with my dad, I developed an affinity for the sport,” Matt said. “Every play was so exciting. Everything could change with one play. From the strategy side, that’s why I liked it, but from the physical side, I loved being able to hit someone without getting in trouble. That’s honestly probably why I fell in love with the sport.”
After 4 years of high school, both Matt and Zach were recruited by some of the best football programs in the country. With top Division I coaches promising them, “We’ll do whatever it takes to get you guys here,” Matt and Zach had great opportunities to play at a powerhouse institution. During the deciding process, they both looked at the same schools – twins stay together. The decision came down to Oregon State, Washington State, and Eastern Washington. All three were great programs and could help them grow as players, but it was the small-town feel that made them gravitate toward Eastern Washington.
Stepping onto campus was more or less a culture shock for the two of them. Both being somewhat reserved made for a tougher than normal transition.
“It was different coming from Tumwater High School where the coaches preached no yelling, no cursing, and no fighting at practice – none of that stuff. Then when we got to college we were cussed at every step we took. It was a big jump coming from high school to college. But luckily Zach and I were there together. That made it easier.”
Then at preseason, during Matt’s freshman year, Eastern Washington and the NCAA Clearinghouse had a major mix up. Some of the coaches misfiled paperwork that caused the entire freshman class to redshirt. Both Matt and Zach’s playing time was put on hold.
After missing his true freshman year, Matt was eager to lace up his cleats and get on the field.",10/3/16
ask-me-anything-joe-holder-responses,Ask Me Anything with Joe Holder,"Last week, we invited questions from the WHOOP community for Joe Holder to answer. Many questions revolved around how to improve Recovery, advice on nutrition, and how to bounce back after being in the red. Read below to see Joe’s responses!
1. What’s your opinion on slow breathing post exercise to help accelerate parasympathetic reactivation? – @jacobprosser_jp
I’m a fan. This is an ongoing field of research but there seems to be a connection between controlled breathing strategies and a positive effect on the parasympathetic nervous system.
For background, and to keep it short, you have two main branches of your autonomic nervous system that work a little differently, the parasympathetic nervous system and sympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic nervous system helps keep us calm, that heart rate lower, and in healthy populations should be the dominant state in resting conditions. Sympathetic nervous system gets us a bit more riled up, accelerates our heart rate, and makes sure we have the juice during exercise or in intense physical + mental situations.
We want to adequately transition back to a PS state post workout so slow breathing can do this, while also giving us a chance to reflect on our workout + get ready for the rest of the day. I like to consider the breathing cool down as really just a warm-up for the rest of your day.
My simple go to choice from breathing is typically a 2:1 or 3:1 (inhalation vs. exhalation).
2. What practical steps do you take to replenish a day’s low recovery score? – @jeremys.music
Not eating too close to bedtime
Hydrating
Having a pre-sleep routine
Meditating
Seeing ways I can still get my work done and tend to my responsibilities, but remove superfluous stressors that don’t have much of a point (not leaving on time for things, watching TV, worrying about things outside my control)
Understand how it falls within my overall life, some days I expect lower recovery scores so I do not let it get in my head",3/12/19
ask-me-anything-joe-holder-responses,Ask Me Anything with Joe Holder,"I use the Recovery scores to guide me, but it is more of a screening tool rather than a diagnostic. It matters how that direct measure blends into my overall picture of my training. If I’m in the meat of say a training cycle, I can typically expect some lower scores as my body is trying to adapt to the stressors I’m imposing. I never really have red recoveries, but sometimes yellow. Even if it is lower than normal that doesn’t mean I’ll completely change my plan, you have to keep the longitudinal vision intact.
8. I’m currently playing American football and want to put on a healthy amount of muscle of which I know I need to be in a caloric surplus. However, I want to try and put on lean muscle whilst burning through the little flab I’ve got on my stomach, hips area. Any suggestions or tips on how I should go about doing this? My diet is pretty solid-more focused on type of training. – @jesseprincefraser
Here’s a brief skeleton of what I would suggest, although of course it is easier if I had a bit more details ha.
You need to have a base level of conditioning proficiency. The only way you’ll be able to handle the increased workload associated with the type of training you’ll want to do for this mass attenuation is to make sure your conditioning base is strong.
In your general prep phases incorporate full body exercises and complexes instead of isolation work.
Play your sport. You still want to make sure you have the ability to perform well even when you’re at a heavier mass.
Use carbohydrates to your advantage here. I would suggest finding an intra-workout and post-workout blend and adding that to your routine.
Suggest utilizing rep schemes that work on both strength and hypertrophy as this will probably have the best impact not just for looks but also your sport.
Don’t be afraid to take longer rest periods, especially if you’re combining rep schemes that mix up strength and hypertrophy. This can be a hidden trick that unlocks improving mass in many people.",3/12/19
ask-me-anything-joe-holder-responses,Ask Me Anything with Joe Holder,"3. How much time should I wait before working out after I eat? When should my last meal be, before going to bed? – @j_demember
This is a very person specific question but I typically suggest 90 minutes to 2 hours to have a meal before working out if possible.
Before bed I suggest 3 hours to allow your digestion to work through the hard aspects and to make sure your body can focus more on repair than digestion during sleep.
4. What are your thoughts on zinc and magnesium supplementation before bed? – @nickbrbot
I would always check with your doctor before starting to take any supplements, but the usage of the proper magnesium (I personally go with a bis-glycinate blend) has been shown to promote restful sleep and have a calming effect.
5. What are 3 supplements you would suggest to improve recovery? – @agathewave
Magnesium
L- Carnitine
Ginger (I’m very intrigued by the connection between the parasympathetic nervous system and digestion and think ginger, even in food form, can act as a supplement to improve this)
6. Being plant based, how do you keep a high intake of protein? What are some of the best plant based sources? – @diegoyory
I make a few shakes a day which helps me get my protein, but I wouldn’t say I am on a high protein sources. The hardest thing for me is often just getting enough calories during the day so I make sure to focus on eating complete whole food sources and then using supplementation to fill in any possible gaps. If you get enough calories you’ll end up getting (for the most part) enough protein.
7. Even on days when you have Red recoveries, do you still train as planned? – @stacyy.lee",3/12/19
ask-me-anything-joe-holder-responses,Ask Me Anything with Joe Holder,"After your general prep phases and then strength, put in a strong phase of intense conditioning work that is sport specific. This will go a long way in making sure that you “clean up” your new found mass.
9. What advice would you give to someone who wants to start their fitness/wellness journey but doesn’t have a support system/encouraging friends? – @food_fit_fork
Honestly, your friends may be more supportive than you think ! Be sure to let them know your goals and that you would really appreciate their assistance or encouragement. If that still does not work, don’t be shy to find support online. There are many groups online that have been created for this sole purpose. From there, you can also look locally at any groups that may be present in your town.
Last but not least, believe in yourself! Don’t let other people deter you from achieving goals that are worthwhile and healthy for your personal growth.
10. What are some strength training tips for runners? Running my 1st marathon and want to try and avoid any injuries. – @k8tschaller
Get a physical therapist or have a routine of prehab exercises. This is key.
Do single leg work and make sure to work in multiple planes of motion.
Have a quality hinge pattern and make sure that you keep your t-spine mobile. These two things often fix a multitude of issues in runners
During your general prep phase, make sure you have a small cycle focused strictly to strength training. Then go into your running centric work with strength as a slight after thought but still doing enough to make sure it doesn’t fade completely.
Being able to adequately absorb load is important so in the beginning incorporate some eccentric focused training.
Strength training should connect back to eventually making you a better runner so be sure to do exercise that have similar joint angles to running so hopefully there is crossover (step-ups, lunges, etc).",3/12/19

8. On your high straining days, what do you typically do to keep your energy levels high? @positivepapii
I’m naturally super high energy, sometimes almost problematically so! But I always look to how I fuel my body to keep my energy not only high, but clean! This comes from good and supportive nutrition, hydration (I drink around 3 litres of water a day), focusing on breathing properly and the words I use not only with others but with myself. Don’t underestimate the power of internal conditioning and what words you let run around in your head all day. Exercise is also obviously a big energy kick for me however, on my very high strain days I have to be careful not to exert too much energy in every direction to avoid burnout.

Every day is uniquely different. While we might have good sleep, hygiene, and healthy nutrition, there are many other stressors on the body. Training itself is an added stress, then there’s work, relationships, and the constant demands of living in busy cities. We need to be cognisant if too many areas of our life are trying to live in the fast lane at once. I know when my schedule is really crazy with work I have to dial down on my own training to ensure my recovery doesn’t start to get away from me. Start to dig a little deeper into your results and take some accounting on the days where your recovery is dropping, so you can make the necessary tweaks to stay on top of it.

6. Why does drinking alcohol affect your recovery negatively? @april_stl
6. Why does drinking alcohol affect your recovery negatively? @april_stl
Alcohol affects your recovery negatively by attacking your sleep. Alcohol is actually classified as a sedative. It starts by immobilising your prefrontal cortex, which is the part of the brain that controls our impulses and restrains our behavior, then carries on to sedate other parts of the brain. There are two major ways alcohol impacts our sleep, which is the biggest link to our recovery.
1) It drops you into an alcohol-infused sleep likened to a light form of anaesthesia. It is not continuous and is therefore not restorative.
2) Alcohol is one of the most powerful suppressors of REM sleep, our dream sleep state. When we continuously miss this very important part of our sleep, we get a backlog of pressure to obtain REM sleep (you can see your REM sleep stats in the sleep breakdown on WHOOP). As little as one drink can have a powerful impact on this.",3/22/19
ask-me-anything-kirsty-godso-responses,"Ask Me Anything with ""Energy Dealer"" Kirsty Godso","Absolutely! I never really had any idea how much strain I was clocking up by training other people in 1:1 sessions and especially classes. When I teach group workouts where I’m only doing 20% of the workout, my strain will often rank much higher than my personal workouts because I’m yelling and racing around making sure everyone is moving and dealing energy! Take 3 of those group workouts in one day, plus my own training and other work demands such as clients, calls, meetings and running a business, and you can see yourself empty at the end of the day.
My highest ranking day on WHOOP so far was on a low intensity workout day, but my strain ranked almost a 21 where the bulk of it came from cognitive stress when I was working through shipping logistics for my protein powder! Having this extra intel from WHOOP is a good kicker to make smarter decisions for my body and brain so I can keep performing well in all areas of my job. We have to listen (and watch) what our body is saying to us rather than just talking at it and demanding from it all the time.

#inthegreen",3/22/19
ask-us-anything-strain,Ask Us Anything: WHOOP Strain,"I have 3 activities in a day, but the total strain does equal the sum of each. Why? -@duffy_wan
We cover this in the podcast linked above, but strain does not operate on a linear scale. You can have multiple activities throughout the day, but they will not add up to a total day strain. Just because you have 2 relatively easy activities at 6 strain, for example, does not mean it equates to a 12 strain on your body. More likely, you’ll end up with an 8 or 9 strain in culmination with the rest of your day.
If I take an ice bath, do yoga or cryo, do I get strain reversed? -@notthefakedrew
Physiologically speaking, the cardiovascular strain on your body can’t be reversed once you’ve put your body through it. There is no way to retroactively reduce your WHOOP strain; it will only build throughout the day. However, activities such as naps, cryotherapy, or ice baths can certainly aid your recovery.
How do we accumulate strain even when we haven’t done a workout? -@adamgeering
Day strain is a measure of the strain you have accumulated over the course of an entire day. There are numerous factors beyond your workouts that affect the strain on your body, including stress, your commute, your job, yard work, chores around the house, etc. In fact, many WHOOP members have noticed that on particularly taxing days (being on their feet all day or a stressful day at work) their WHOOP strain is noticeably higher, even if they haven’t worked out.
I work out in the morning. Is there a way to use my strain to ensure I still have enough energy for the rest of the day without being overly exhausted? -@305jm9055
We’d recommend using the Strain Target feature in your WHOOP app. It will suggest an optimal strain range for the day based on your recovery. If you know your day will be particularly taxing, you can adjust your workouts accordingly based on what the strain target is telling you.
Why does my WHOOP sometimes record a strain of 3 or 4 when I first wake up? -@jwysokowski43",8/13/19
ask-us-anything-strain,Ask Us Anything: WHOOP Strain,"We’ve talked in-depth about strain on the WHOOP podcast and show notes, and we’ve covered topics such as the Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion and heart rate zones to help the WHOOP community better understand what it all means. If you haven’t had a chance to listen or read yet, we encourage you to do so to get the most out of your WHOOP data.
Below, we’ve selected 15 specific questions from WHOOP members about strain. Whether you’re a long-time member or you just joined, we hope you find this information valuable and relevant to your training!
I’ve had days where I hit 15+ strain and burn 2500 calories, and other days where I hit 4000 calories. Why? -@baby_drew77
There’s more than one way to get a 15 strain. For example, one day you could spend most of your time in a light training zone: active, but not overdoing it. Another day you could be resting in the morning with a period of hard to max training in the afternoon, which will rapidly increase your strain and calories burned. It’s important to note that the rate at which you build strain and burn calories does not always scale the same.
How many high strain days should you have in a row? -@geologist_who_wods
There is no strict guideline for how many days you should spend getting a high strain. What’s more important is how your body is recovering and adapting to training. If you have consistently high strain, but over time you notice you are struggling to recover adequately, then WHOOP recommends you reduce your strain to let your body rest and heal. There are many endurance athletes who regularly have high strain, but their bodies have adapted to that kind of cardiovascular training.
What’s the correlation between muscle strain and body strain? -@amiin_
WHOOP measures strain based on cardiovascular load and muscular load. When you use Strength Trainer, WHOOP can track your weights, reps, and sets to understand the demands you are putting on your musculoskeletal system.",8/13/19
ask-us-anything-strain,Ask Us Anything: WHOOP Strain,"Your WHOOP cycle begins when you fall asleep, then resets the next time you fall asleep (some other wearables operate on a fixed 24 hour cycle, which isn’t an accurate portrayal of your body’s routine). Therefore, you’ll wake up with a relatively low strain, since your body is still using energy and burning calories while you’re asleep.
Why does strain build faster some days than others when activity level is close to the same? – @josh_moses79
Strain can accumulate differently based on your body’s recovery. If you wake up in the red, your body will work harder to achieve the same performance results than if you were in the green. Additionally, because strain can be affected by things like stress and diet, no two days are exactly the same, even if you’re doing the same activities.
What information gives me my average day strain? Mine is about 15.8 -@sanzoeb
Your average day strain is a basic average calculation from your past 30 days of data on WHOOP. It is a good indication of your baseline and what your body is used to.
What factors make strain different from person to person? – @drbrandonbrown
Just like all of the data you collect on WHOOP, strain is personal to your physiology. Strain can be affected by things like fitness level, diet, hydration, stress, illness, injury, alcohol, health conditions, training loads, and more.
Why is it impossible to reach 21? -@atlrel
The strain scale is set based on the mathematical limit: if you were operating at your max HR for 24 hours, you would earn a 21. However, that’s physiologically impossible, so while you technically “can” get a 21, no one ever will.
How is HRV used to calculate available daily strain?
HRV does not factor into WHOOP strain, only into your recovery. HRV constantly fluctuates throughout the day based on internal and external stressors, which is why WHOOP measures HRV at night when your body is at rest for the most accurate, consistent reading.
LEARN MORE:",8/13/19
ask-us-anything-strain,Ask Us Anything: WHOOP Strain,"Muscular load measures movement and its underlying physics using the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors in WHOOP, and combines these signals with advanced biomechanics and mathematics. This metric includes both volume and intensity components.
Volume is measured similarly to traditional volume load, but it incorporates effective mass. It takes into account your body mass, but only includes the parts of your body that are moving and doing the work. For example, a full body exercise like a squat or clean and jerk will have more muscular load than a bench press.
Intensity quantifies how much effort or exertion you are giving to complete the lift. This includes the speed of the movement and the proximity to failure, or the fatigue profile of the set.
WHOOP then calculates the cardiovascular and muscular load of your strength training to give you one complete Strain score.
If I have a daily strain above 17, can I expect my recovery to tank the next day? -@raised_in_baseball
While your chance of reduced recovery the next day is elevated due to the high-strain day, one day of high strain does not guarantee a poor next-day recovery. There are many athletes who are well-conditioned and regularly achieve high strain and are able to bounce back quickly. Additionally, there are many other internal and external factors that affect recovery beyond cardiovascular strain, such as diet, sleep quality, psychological stress, and more.
Is the strain based on a fixed formula or does it have iterations to respond to trends? -@mars_mapper
The WHOOP strain algorithm is not fixed. It adjusts to your personal baseline, which is why two people can do the same workout and have vastly different strains. Your strain will adjust to changes in fitness level, so as your fitness improves the same workouts will create less strain.

ask-whoop-demographic-data,Ask WHOOP: Why Do We Collect Demographic Data At Sign Up?,"The WHOOP “secret sauce” comes from our ability to learn from all the data we collect from you and use it to personalize our algorithms. This enables every score to reflect what it means for you to produce the metrics you just produced.
For example, everyone needs a different amount of sleep each night to be fully restored, so 7.5 hours might be great for one person and insufficient for another. A completely personalized analytics experience has one downside–the need to calibrate. When you create your WHOOP account, our first task is to get to know you as quickly as possible. Rather than have every member calibrate from the same starting point, we use the demographic information you provide at signup to create the best possible “starting point” for your calibration. The better you fit our guess about what your data will look like the faster you calibrate, and using your reported sex and fitness level data allows us to predict better calibration baselines than we could without that information.
If you don’t fit the mould, well, no worries, we’ll still figure it out in a week or so. And, once you are fully calibrated, we actually no longer use fitness level in our algorithms.
Weekly Performance Assessment Comparisons
On the final page of the Weekly Performance Assessment, we compare each member’s data to other WHOOP members of the same age range and gender. We do this in order to provide the most relevant context to your data, and because many of our members requested this comparison and enjoy seeing it. However, comparison to peers is never incorporated into any of the scores or algorithms.
Research
Behind the scenes, we also use your demographic data for internal research. It helps our analysts know which populations we are serving well and where we need to focus future development. We also use demographic information to understand patterns in the data, like what we did for World Sleep Day last March.
What We Don’t Use It For",6/19/19
ask-whoop-demographic-data,Ask WHOOP: Why Do We Collect Demographic Data At Sign Up?,"When you create your WHOOP membership, we collect some personal data such as your height, weight, sex, and fitness level. Many of you have reached out asking what we do with this information, and because we recognize that disclosing personal information is potentially uncomfortable, we wanted to take a moment to clarify when and where we use it.
Calorie Burn Estimations
Our calorie burn estimates build on decades of research which has shown that short of measuring gas exchange directly, caloric burn formulas including sex, height, and weight are more accurate than those that don’t control for those things, and therefore are essential in delivering the most accurate estimates of caloric consumption possible with a wrist-worn device.
Even after controlling for height and weight, we see differences in caloric consumption at rest (basal metabolic rate) and during activities explained by biological sex. This phenomenon seems to be primarily driven by differences in muscle mass (those with greater muscle mass burn more calories than do those with less muscle mass) and differences in testosterone levels (testosterone increases basal metabolic rate).
While we know that muscle mass and testosterone levels vary meaningfully across individuals and that binary sex is an imperfect predictor of these two factors, for most individuals most of the time, including this information results in a more accurate prediction of caloric consumption than would be possible without it.
In order to get the most out of your WHOOP membership, we recommend that you periodically update your weight in order to keep these estimates as accurate as possible.

at-home-workouts-heart-rate,Exercises to Do at Home to Stay Fit and Get Your Heart Rate Up,"## Easy Workouts to Do at Home
During a regular training cycle, the most effective way to reach an athletic goal is to follow a plan that creates a specific stimulus and progressively works toward your desired result. But with all the uncertainty of the current global landscape, many of us are feeling higher levels of stress and daily strain, making now a great time to switch up your approach and focus on the process rather than the end result.
Even if you are stuck at home with limited equipment, there are still plenty of things you can do to exercise, stay in shape, and elevate your heart rate. Here are several simple and quick at-home workout moves to boost your cardiovascular health and keep your muscles toned (click links to watch video demonstrations).
## Squat Progression (lower body leg exercises at home)
These are some of the most foundational movements of all humans, and will help build posterior chain and midline strength. To take it to the next level, add in challenging tempos to your progressions, especially if you have limited access to equipment.
Air squats to a target (a table, chair, box or medicine ball)
Air squats
Jumping squats (this will really get your heart rate up quickly!)
Goblet squats (with a weighted object like a kettlebell or dumbbell)
Front squats (with double kettlebells, double dumbbells, a barbell or sandbag)
Thrusters (a front squat + push press over your head–also very good for a quick HR bump)",3/19/20
at-home-workouts-heart-rate,Exercises to Do at Home to Stay Fit and Get Your Heart Rate Up,"Burpee Progression (full-body workout at home)
As with push ups, there are variations of burpees that fit all skill and fitness levels. They are an outstanding way to get the entire body involved. If you have no equipment at all, try this one: Every minute on the minute for 20 minutes, complete 10 burpees (or the equivalent of 30-35 seconds of reps).
Get ups (simply lay down and stand back up)
No push-up burpee
Full burpee
Burpee to a 6-inch target above outstretched arms
Burpee box jumps
## Running
You likely need to get outside for this one, but obviously there’s no equipment necessary. Higher intensity intervals with shorter rest periods will get your HR up in a hurry. A combination of short, intense runs and longer, steady-state runs will help develop different energy systems while providing a nice change of pace.
High knees in place
Shuttle sprints
100m, 200m, 400m repeat intervals
## Jumping (cardio at home)
Continuous jumping is excellent for both spiking your HR (if you’re not proficient at the skill) or getting into a great steady state of cardio, alternative to the norms like running, cycling, rowing, etc. A pattern of high box jumps will burn the legs and the lungs equally, but watch those feet on the edge of the box when you start to get fatigued!
Box step ups
Box jumps (you can use stairs, a bench, table, etc)
Jump rope
Jump rope double unders

at-home-workouts-heart-rate,Exercises to Do at Home to Stay Fit and Get Your Heart Rate Up,"Push-up Progression (upper body workout at home)
Push ups can be a challenging movement for many, but there are types that fit all fitness and ability levels. Start with the scaled versions and continue to build through to the more difficult iterations. Work towards finding a variation that you can complete 5-8 unbroken reps fairly regularly for 5 sets as a starting place. In general, push-ups tend to bring your HR back down, you will likely experience muscular failure before achieving a long enough duration to keep your HR elevated.
Incline push up on a surface (like a box or table)
Kneeling push up
Strict push up
Hand release push up (where you pull your hands off the ground between each)
Deficit push up (with your hands on plates or dumbbells)
Weighted push ups (try a weighted vest or plates on your back)
If you can only do two things, a squat progression followed by a push-up progression is a great quick at home workout.
## Lunge Progression (movement in different planes)
Lunges can be a perfect combination of building cardiovascular fitness and muscular strength training at home. Adding weighted objects in a variety of positions will tax your body’s core and work to build your stabilizing muscles.
Standing split squat
Alternating forward walking lunges
Alternating reverse lunges
Alternating lateral lunges
Alternating jumping lunges (this one and everything that follows will elevate your HR rapidly)
Weighted walking lunges (with weight at your side)
Front rack walking lunges (using a kettlebell, dumbbell, barbell or sandbag)
Overhead walking lunges (with a kettlebell, dumbbell, barbell, sandbag or plate)",3/19/20

Athletes who reduced their workload when their recovery suggested their body needed rest were up to 32.4% less likely to get injured and also spent as many as 80 fewer minutes per week training–all while making similar improvements in their 5k times.

Our Founder and CEO Will Ahmed started WHOOP after being a college athlete who regularly overtrained. He realized that how he was feeling was not a reliable indicator of his body’s readiness to perform, so he set out to create a product that was.
He discovered that by tracking things like resting heart rate, heart rate variability, respiratory rate and sleep, we could unlock secrets our bodies are trying to tell us and better understand our ability to execute at a high level.
WHOOP uses this biometric data to calculate your recovery each morning–how prepared your body is to take on strain. Our strain metric quantifies the cardiovascular exertion put on your body, over the course of an entire day and for individual workouts and activities. Inspired by the Borg Scale, WHOOP strain is an objective measure of the impact of your exercise.
The app’s Strain Target makes exertion-level recommendations based on your daily recovery, then monitors your strain in real time as you work out to let you know exactly when you’ve reached your optimal amount.
Additionally, WHOOP features a Sleep Planner that factors in your strain from the day to suggest ideal bed and wake times in order to get the best sleep and maximize your recovery the next morning.

autoregulation-training-exercise,"Autoregulation to Improve Training, Exercise More Efficiently & Avoid Burnout","How Do You Train Smarter with Autoregulation?
A common method of autoregulation involves using something like the Borg Scale to rate your level of perceived exertion. This lets you quantify how hard you believe you are exerting yourself during exercise.
Autoregulation consists of taking stock of how you feel beforehand (as well as other variables like amount of sleep, nutrition, hydration, etc) rating your performance for the workout and assessing whether or not it met your expectations. A key aspect of this is keeping a journal or log of the details of your workouts and evaluations of them.
Over time you’ll begin to get a sense of the specific exertion levels various workouts require, and how this is impacted by the way you’re feeling that day. You can then use this knowledge to effectively dial back or ramp up your exercise volume and intensity based on what you believe your body is capable of.
## Autoregulation During Exercise Has Its Flaws
One common hindrance to autoregulation is the competitive nature of athletes. This drive inherently pushes many of us to overdo it–we constantly strive to set new personal bests and perform better than we did before. Intentionally putting forth anything less than your best effort can be difficult to swallow, even with the knowledge that it’s for your long-term benefit.
The subjectivity of it can also be problematic in a variety of ways. How do you know if you’re adjusting your training volume for the right reasons? Our brains may easily confuse “my body can’t handle more than this” with “I just don’t feel like it today.”
On top of that, the way our bodies are feeling is often misleading…",4/16/21
autoregulation-training-exercise,"Autoregulation to Improve Training, Exercise More Efficiently & Avoid Burnout","“Autoregulation” is a popular buzzword when it comes to fitness and training, but what does it actually mean and how can you work out smarter because of it?
## What is Autoregulation?
From a study by renowned scientist and bodybuilder Eric Helms, “autoregulation adjusts variables at an individualized pace per performance, readiness, or recovery.”
In another article, Helms wrote “autoregulation is simply a systematic approach to implementing something every trainer worth their salt knows is of supreme importance: the principle of individuality. … Autoregulation, simply put, is just a structured approach for embedding a respect for individual variation within a program.”
Basically what it means is that instead of following a strict training regimen, you should listen to your body and adjust your workload to fit what you’re capable of each day. Generally this is based on how you believe you are performing compared to previous workouts, or how difficult exercise feels in relation to what is normal for you.
## Why is Autoregulation Training Important?
To an extent, the concept of autoregulation training resembles the classic fable “The Tortoise and the Hare.” If you push yourself too hard, you’ll burn out (overtrain) and not “win” in the long run. Making fitness gains is “a marathon not a sprint,” so to speak.
It’s important to realize that you can’t actually get better every single time you work out, your body just isn’t built that way. Some days it is more equipped to take on heavy training loads than others and you won’t improve your fitness if your body isn’t ready to handle the stress you put it through.
Implementing methods of autoregulation into your training will better enable you to avoid injury and burnout, and allow you to achieve your fitness goals in a more efficient manner.",4/16/21
average-hrv-normal-heart-rate-variability,"What is an ""Average"" HRV? There's No Easy Answer","## Normal Heart Rate Variability
If heart rate variability (the measurement of the intervals between your heart beats) is a metric you’re not familiar with, here’s an explanation of what HRV is, and why it is such a valuable tool for athletes. HRV is also one of the primary components used to calculate WHOOP recovery.
One question we constantly get from WHOOP members is “What should my HRV be?” Unfortunately, there’s no easy answer as to what normal heart rate variability is.
It’s important to realize that HRV can vary widely from one individual to the next. For example, long-time WHOOP Member Scott Holtzman has an average daily HRV of 162. However, Holtzman is a professional UFC fighter (check out his feature story) who regularly works out three times per day. It’s not reasonable for most of us to try to compare ourselves to Scott.
On the other hand, ultra runner Robert Edminster is also an elite athlete. Edminster recently finished third overall in the Wasatch Front 100-Mile Endurance Run, one of the most grueling ultra races in the country. His average HRV last month was 47, among the lower 50% of all WHOOP users.
Age has an enormous effect on HRV as well–it falls off dramatically the older we get. Last summer, WHOOP Member Dave Hippensteel defended his title as the fittest 60-year-old on Earth. Hippensteel’s HRV is regularly in the low 40s.
Rather than worrying about what is “normal” or using other athletes’ heart rate variability as a barometer, it can be much more valuable to track your own trends in HRV.
Our Director of Software, Mark Flores, is a perfect example. Mark, who is 32 years old, has an average HRV over the last month of 33. “That’s gone down a bit since it got cold outside (this story was originally published December 18, 2017) and I started working out a little less,” he said.
Below is a three-month chart of Mark’s HRV data from when he first began working at WHOOP (and wearing a Strap) earlier this year:",12/18/17
average-hrv-normal-heart-rate-variability,"What is an ""Average"" HRV? There's No Easy Answer","You can see regular fluctuation in Mark’s HRV day by day, but also a clear trend upwards over time.
“Being a part of WHOOP and seeing how athletes use it has been tremendously inspiring for me,” Mark explained. “Since I first learned about HRV, I’ve been trying hard to increase it. My workouts used to be primarily weightlifting and yoga, but now I do cardio as well, which I hated until I saw the value of it in my data. I work out every day unless I’m sore or my Recovery is in the red, it usually ends up being about five or six days a week.”
Mark’s HRV went up and his overall fitness improved. “The cardio has helped my lifting and yoga too!” Mark added.

Below is a graphic depicting the average amount of time WHOOP members spend in each of the 4 stages of sleep on a nightly basis, as well as the percentage of total time each stage represents.
WHOOP MEMBERS’ AVERAGE SLEEP TIME & PERCENTAGE BY STAGE OF SLEEP
It’s worth noting that for the most part our members are people who are interested in tracking their physiological data 24/7 and improving their overall performance, so it’s likely they make more of an effort to get quality sleep than the general population as a whole.
Every human body is different, and the amount of sleep we need varies from person to person. The middle 50% of all WHOOP members average the following per night:
3:28-3:59 of light sleep (44-51%)
3:28-3:59 of light sleep (44-51%)
1:44-2:00 of REM sleep (22-26%)
1:44-2:00 of REM sleep (22-26%)
1:23-1:32 of deep sleep (17-20%)
1:23-1:32 of deep sleep (17-20%)
0:43-0:50 awake (9-11%)
0:43-0:50 awake (9-11%)
## How Much Sleep Should You Get?
Looking at the graphic above, if you subtract the time awake from the total, WHOOP members average 7:02 of sleep each night. The middle 50% range between 6:42 and 7:24.
However, there’s obviously a difference between how much sleep people actually get and how much they should get.
The WHOOP Sleep Planner tells you exactly how much sleep you need each night (based on strain your body accumulates during the day, sleep debt left over from previous nights, and any potential naps), and makes recommendations for exactly when to go to bed and wake up in order to optimize your sleep.

average-sleep-stages-time,How Much Time Should You Spend in Each Stage of Sleep?,"There are 4 stages of sleep that your body experiences each night (usually spanning 3-5 sleep cycles): Light sleep, deep sleep (also referred to as slow wave sleep or SWS), REM sleep and awake. For a more in-depth explanation of how this works, check out Understanding Sleep Cycles and the Stages of Sleep.
Below we’ll give a brief overview of the 4 sleep stages, then break down what’s normal for how much time you should be spending in all of them.
## The 4 Stages of Sleep
### 1. LIGHT SLEEP
1. LIGHT SLEEP
Light sleep occurs as you transition to deep sleep. It has minimal restorative impact and you can be easily awakened during it. Your body is more responsive to its environment in this stage.
### 2. DEEP SLEEP (SWS)
2. DEEP SLEEP (SWS)
Deep sleep, known as the “physically restorative” stage of sleep, is when your muscles and tissues repair themselves and cells regenerate. The body produces 95% of human growth hormone during this time. It is often difficult to wake up during deep sleep, and when you do you are likely to feel groggy and disoriented.
### 3. REM SLEEP
3. REM SLEEP
REM sleep is the “mentally restorative” stage, during which your brain converts short-term memories made during the day into long-term ones. The brain is also very active during REM sleep (REM stands for “rapid eye movement”), and your heart rate and respiratory rate increase. Additionally, it is when your most vivid dreams occur.
### 4. AWAKE
4. AWAKE
This is included as a stage of sleep because it is normal to be awake for several brief periods of time throughout the night while you are “sleeping.” Referred to as arousals (“disturbances” in the WHOOP app), it is common to experience as many as 10-20 over the course of a night’s sleep. They only last for minutes at a time and you’re generally not conscious of them, but they can add up to significant sleep loss.

One in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. Additionally, 58% of women with breast cancer suffer from cancer related depression and 32% experience general anxiety disorder.
WHOOP and Barbells for Boobs, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, will work together in an effort to contribute to research being done in this space. The goal is to improve the lives of breast cancer survivors post-diagnosis, and to help to reduce the risk of breast cancer by emphasizing the importance of appropriate levels of sleep, exercise and recovery.
Barbells for Boobs’ mission states:
“We are a community taking action in breast cancer by providing support and education to incorporate physical activity as the foundation for breast cancer risk reduction, treatment, and survivorship. We are improving the quality of life and outcomes in individuals impacted by breast cancer.”",10/1/20

To begin our research, we are conducting a case study examining WHOOP data (sleep, resting heart rate, heart rate variability and more) from a number of cancer survivors in the Barbells for Boobs community.
Phase 1 of the study will establish the participants’ baseline metrics and observe trends. In Phase 2, based on the initial data various interventions will be recommended to each subject depending on where they need the most help. For example, we suspect many may be sleeping poorly, so behaviors will be suggested to boost the quality of their sleep.
In Phase 3, we’ll look for any changes (hopefully improvements) in the data based on the interventions made, and use this to lay the groundwork for more extensive research going forward.
From Kristen Holmes, our VP of Performance Science who will be facilitating the study:
“There are significant gaps in the research on how to implement sustainable lifestyle changes in this population. Our ultimate goal is to identify specific behaviors related to sleep, movement, stress management and recovery, that will improve the resilience and overall quality of life of these individuals. We have a real opportunity to use the data to develop a coherent ‘playbook’ that will focus effort and improve outcomes.”

I was only 19 years old then, and I wasn’t really in the mix for the run up to those games. But by 2010, I’d had a handful of years of international experience from World Cup, World Championships and X Games and I knew I could contend. Unfortunately, I came up just a bit short of making the team.
However, I got an opportunity to go to the 2010 Vancouver games as a staff member. I was a wax technician for my team, which is sort of the equivalent of a bat boy in baseball or a caddie in golf. I prepped all of my teammates equipment. It was really challenging when I was there, watching all my teammates competing for this life-long dream that I’d always wanted. But at the same time, I got to see what the Olympics were like from behind the scenes, it was a super important experience. Not only did it motivate me big time to train ever harder over the course of the next 4 years, I learned a ton about what it’s like to compete at the games.
In 2014, I managed to make the Olympic team and was fortunate enough to bring home a medal. I think a lot of that was due to the insight I gained in 2010.”

How did you find out about WHOOP?
“It was last summer, one of my teammates brought it to the attention of my coach. He took a good look and thought it’d be a great training tool. My coach and I are huge data nerds. We’re very much into all the latest tracking devices and I’ve always been really committed to fitness and training. WHOOP provided another way to try and gain an advantage by looking into our metrics.”

We spoke to Alex last month about his introduction to the sport, his fascinating journey to the medal podium four years ago, and how he incorporates WHOOP into his training. Unfortunately, Alex fell just shy of making the U.S. team for PyeongChang.
When did you first get into snowboarding?
“Growing up, skiing and snowboarding were always a big part of what my family did. We used to drive from Connecticut to Vermont every weekend with my aunts, uncles and cousins. I started skiing at age 2 and snowboarding at age 4–right about when it began getting some mainstream attention and popularity. I sort of came into it on my own though. My parents never pushed me into sports, I was always pretty self driven. I saw snowboarding and asked my mom if I could try it, so she got me a snowboard for Christmas.”
At what point did you start really taking it seriously?
“When I was 8 years old, there was an event at my local mountain that I asked to sign up for. That was my very first competition. I won my first event and caught the bug. From then on, I competed more and more consistently as I got older. When I was in high school, I was recruited to go to a ski academy in Stratton, VT. My sophomore year, my family picked up shop and moved to Vermont full time. Soon after that, I began competing professionally in half-pipe and slopestyle. As a high school senior in 2004, I was named to the inaugural US snowboard team. That was when I realized there was potential for me to actually make a career out of it. I started traveling and competing more internationally, and here I am today.”

There’s not enough time left to put in a major effort to make big gains, but you also want to do as much work as possible to maintain where you’re at. I’ve been home for the last couple weeks, getting a pretty hard training block in right now to do a little midseason tuneup. We’re about to fly to Europe for the last Olympic qualifying World Cup event, then we come home for a week before the team travels to Korea.
At this point in the season, it’s really all about maintenance. Right now I’m doing 2-3 days a week in the gym, and on snow 3-4 days a week if the weather cooperates. Basically just all the little work, making sure all systems are good to go.”
How do you handle all that travel?
“I’ve been fortunate to travel quite a bit over the course of my career, so I’m quite familiar with jet lag and how it can wreak havoc. That’s another thing I love about WHOOP, not only being able to track how my Recovery fluctuates through heavy training loads, but also what flying to South America or Europe does to it. I’m a big fan of sleep aids on the plane, I take melatonin when I travel across time zones to try and adjust my body clock as soon as possible.

Do you have a tip for best fighting jet lag?
Whenever I arrive overseas I always like to get a light workout in the day I arrive. Whether it’s a 30-minute run, or some light core yoga, anything to just get a little bit of a sweat on and get my system awake and going. Sometimes we travel to places where we don’t have access to a gym, and then maybe it’s taking a long walk or a hike in the mountains to shake out the jet lag. I mention that because it’s applicable to everybody. It’s not hard to do and it makes such a huge impact in terms of adjusting your body to the right time zone as quickly as possible.”

It really helps me when I’m working with my strength coach to plan appropriately if I have a race coming up. One of the first things I noticed over the course of the summer was how my Recovery would dip dramatically after a few continuous days of hard training:
I’ve gotten much better at not overextending myself in the run up to an event or an important on-snow training block. WHOOP allows us to tailor my workouts and taper appropriately, so that I can be firing on all cylinders when it matters most.”
What kind of training do you do?
“The cool part about boardercross is that it uses so many different systems. Even though our races are only about a minute long, you still need a really high aerobic capacity. It’s an incredibly high anaerobic workout–our heart rates get upwards of 180, 190, close to 200–but you also have to be able to do 4 or 5 runs in a short period of time to make a finals, so endurance comes into play when you repeat those efforts over and over again.
Power is also extremely important. When we’re in the gym, we’re doing very well-rounded training. We have something called a power block, which is a lot of Olympic lifting. We also do power endurance stuff similar to what people consider CrossFit. I think of it as ‘high-intensity intervals.’ We do lots of low-intensity long-term endurance stuff too. We call that ‘A1,’ things like riding a bike for anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours. It’s really varied.”

The Program will integrate WHOOP™ wearable technology to deliver data-driven interventions to support individually optimized programming results.
The Battle Cancer Program (BCP): Post cancer treatment has traditionally focused on clinical interventions and missed the host of research backed concurrent benefits offered by lifestyle interventions and the biological impact of movement and exercise on recovery*.
The aim of the 12-week program is to engage people who have experienced cancer in a meaningful, structured, and progressive exercise rehabilitation program, supported by medical research and evidence, that builds physical confidence and independence, and a belief in a better quality of life and health for the future. The environments that house the BCP are inspiring and inclusive, and most importantly non-medical.
The BCP adheres to the best practice in terms of physical rehabilitation yet is distinctly different to the common means of assisted recovery through exercise. Firstly, the BCP is housed within the world’s best gym facilities and delivered by the most highly skilled and experienced fitness professionals operating within the global sector. Secondly, the focus of the exercise sessions is to instill life-long compliance with exercise as a behavior, and not merely as a means of short-term intervention. The BCP is a new beginning for those who choose to enroll and the first step towards believing and achieving new standards of health and fitness.",2/4/22

Now in 2022 with WHOOP onboard, Battle Cancer hopes to utilize the power of 24-hour biometric data to enhance and optimize results for participants.
About the role of WHOOP: Each participant will wear a WHOOP 4.0, a wearable device which monitors sleep, recovery and daily effort around the clock, during the entirety of the training cycle, offering real-time, quantitative personalized data. This will allow participants to avoid second guessing how they feel and encourage them to train if their recovery score, calculated from the previous 24 hours data including HRV, resting heart rate and sleep performance, is satisfactory.
Strain is another key feature, unique to WHOOP, which will be integral to participants’ approach to training. The value measures the cumulative cardiovascular load a participant’s body takes on in 24 hours, as well as giving a score for individual activities and includes data from internal stressors.",2/4/22

Devon took on this challenge in an effort to raise money for FitOps, an organization that helps veterans find careers in fitness as coaches and trainers. His goal was also to increase awareness for veteran mental health and suicide prevention. When Devon was 16 years old, his father took his own life.

Timing your meals effectively helps promote “circadian synergy.” I do my best to eat with the sun. Skin health, and our overall health, is not just about what we eat–of equal importance is when we eat. I try to eat while it’s light, and limit what I eat during hours when it is dark (with a hard stop at 7 pm). I see in my WHOOP data the earlier I eat dinner, the better I sleep and the better I feel and look the next day.⁣",12/18/20

Circadian rhythm disruption has been implicated in a wide variety of dermatologic conditions. By understanding and adopting basic behaviors that contribute to circadian alignment, we can then start to create a foundation that enables our underlying biological processes to function in the most optimal way.
In principle, the less friction we create for our body to do what it wants to do on the inside, the more benefits we will observe on the outside.",12/18/20
beauty-sleep-circadian-synergy-skin-health,Beauty Sleep: The Connection Between Circadian Synergy & Skin Health,"More Key Behaviors to Improve Skin Health
### Reduce Sugar Intake
Research indicates that elevated glucose levels can speed up the aging of the skin and create conditions that lead to acne. The biggest culprit that creates an obvious elevation in glucose levels is, no surprise, sugar. Excess sugar in the body appears to speed up processes associated with:
poor function of structural proteins like collagen & elastin
thinning of skin
reduced blood flow
decreased pigment production
a degradation in cell turnover and replication
Excess sugar also can cause inflammation. Chronic low-grade inflammation produces enzymes that break down collagen and elastin, resulting in more visible fine lines and less elasticity.⁣
### ⁣Buffer Stress with Rest
Stress can spike insulin levels (just like eating sugar can). When we allow stress to build without giving ourselves time to rest we end up releasing too much cortisol. This biochemical imbalance interferes with your ability to fall asleep at night and will also fragment sleep, leading to less time in deeper restorative stages and more time in light and awake stages.
The effects of stress are particularly correlated with acne breakouts, as well as dull, dry and tired looking skin. Building in moments of rest (diaphragmatic breathing is a great option) after acute stressors is a key skill that will help drive quality sleep, which will in turn lead to healthier, younger looking skin.",12/18/20

Water solves for a lot. Want to boost metabolism? Have some water! Proper hydration can boost your body’s ability to burn fat. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism found that consuming water (about 17 oz) increases metabolic rate by 30% in healthy men and women. Want to improve your focus? Drink some water! Your brain needs a lot of oxygen to function at optimum levels, so drinking plenty of water ensures that it’s getting all it needs.
Want better looking skin? Again, water! It replenishes skin tissue and skin cells, plus it improves your skin’s elasticity.",12/18/20
beauty-sleep-circadian-synergy-skin-health,Beauty Sleep: The Connection Between Circadian Synergy & Skin Health,"Is Beauty Sleep a Real Thing?
Your skin contains circadian clock genes, which play a role in the regulation of the circadian rhythm (Zanello et.al., 2000). Transepidermal water loss, keratinocyte proliferation, skin blood flow, and skin temperature have all been shown to have circadian variations. It makes sense that when these natural rhythms become disrupted, we will see it on our face (literally!).
Below is a quick outline of behaviors that impact the activation of necessary processes which can influence skin health:
### Consistent, Quality Sleep
“Beauty sleep” is 100% a real thing. When your sleep and wake times are irregular, it makes getting quality sleep (enough time spent in REM and slow wave sleep) that much more difficult. Inconsistent and low-quality sleep has a wide range of effects on many underlying biological processes, including hormone production and release, stress levels, inflammation, and even your eating habits.
All of those can have a substantial impact on the health of your skin. The signs of not optimizing sleep show up in the form of fine lines, uneven pigmentation, and reduced elasticity–all of which mean more wrinkles.
### Align Your “Clocks”
Consistent sleep and wake timing, as well as ensuring a cold, dark, and quiet environment are key. These habits and environmental conditions optimize time in deeper stages of sleep (when the body releases a majority of human growth hormone), a necessary ingredient to produce collagen. Poor quality sleep also raises cortisol levels which interfere with collagen production. ⁣
### ⁣Natural Light⁣
Exposure to natural light in the early morning hours sets our circadian rhythm/internal clock and enables quality sleep. We need the sun’s bright blue light in the morning to become alert and active. At night, darkness, or at least the absence of blue light, jump-starts the brain’s (and consequently the skin’s), sleep and recovery mode. ⁣",12/18/20
beauty-sleep-circadian-synergy-skin-health,Beauty Sleep: The Connection Between Circadian Synergy & Skin Health,"Your circadian rhythms are driven by a daily biological clock that persists even in a constant environment. This biological rhythm has a selective advantage in nature, allowing organisms to ‘anticipate’ sunrise (or sunset) rather than just react to these events. All of us are familiar with this rhythmic aspect of our life, whether it’s the regular timing of waking up in the morning, the rise and set of the sun, or hunger cues at normal intervals during the day.
We’ve also experienced what it feels like when these regular and predictable environmental patterns get disrupted by things like travel across many time zones (jet lag), social commitments that extend past our natural bed time (social jet lag), or a new baby (or puppy) in the house.
These are usually relatively short disturbances in the grand scheme of things, but if they persist for long periods of time they can be detrimental to our biological functioning. In turn, they compromise our overall health and well-being. One of the less talked about consequences of chronic misalignment is the impact on our skin health.",12/18/20

behind-the-scenes-with-an-nba-performance-coach,Behind the Scenes With an NBA Performance Coach,"“As a young performance coach, I started off doing it out of the back of my trunk, traveling from park to park, gym to gym, just trying to get as much experience as I could. I never thought I’d ever be doing anything like this. I’m tremendously excited and blessed to be in the position I am today.”
Mike Guevara, or “Coach Mike G,” as he’s often called, was born in Oakland, CA. He officially claims to be from the Bay Area, but as the son of a 20-year army veteran he moved around for most of his childhood. Growing up in Colorado, Georgia, Louisiana, Alabama and even Germany was challenging socially, but he says it helped him develop many essential skills for his profession. “I wouldn’t change a thing,” Mike told WHOOP.
Despite being undersized for his sport and not particularly fast, Mike was able to earn a football scholarship to play wide receiver at Ferris State University. Making up for what he lacked in raw talent with hard work and pure will is what he calls “the story of my athletic career.”
After graduating from college, Mike let go of his farfetched NFL aspirations when he “came to the realization that being 5’8” and 165 pounds wasn’t going to cut it.” Instead, Mike became determined to help other elite athletes reach their goals.
“Through trying to chase the dream of playing professionally I developed a really keen passion for strength and performance training.”
Mike used his degree in exercise science to obtain an internship at The Factory Training facility in Westlake Village, CA. From there he began assisting on NFL and NBA combine preps. His first big break came when top-ranked tennis player Victoria Azarenka started training there. She needed a strength and conditioning coach, and after two days of a one-week trial period Mike sold Azarenka on bringing him on tour with her full time.",2/17/17
behind-the-scenes-with-an-nba-performance-coach,Behind the Scenes With an NBA Performance Coach,"“That was an enormous opportunity for me,” said Mike, “to travel with such a high-profile athlete. From there everything just snowballed and I was able to generate a nice private business. As soon as people see you working with a No. 1 player everyone wants to work with you.”
Today, Mike is the personal performance coach for an NBA All Star. The two met years ago when the player was a rookie development project at The Factory:
“He gravitated towards me even though I was the assistant at the time. He and I just clicked. When I got higher up in the company I was the one he wanted to work with. You can know everything there is to know about strength and conditioning; you can be the best coach, but if you don’t have chemistry with the people that you’re working with it doesn’t really matter.”
Mike first discovered WHOOP when he heard that some other NBA players were wearing it. “I always try to stay cutting edge and be on top of all the tech out there,” he said. “I’ve tried just about every device available.” Mike began using WHOOP last year and has worn it ever since:
“It doesn’t come off my wrist. Other wearables are good within the sport and within practice, but what about the rest of the time? What about recovery? Many previous devices I’d worked with were too sporadic and not very accurate. The way WHOOP measures heart rate variability is very impactful for me as a coach. It’s an incredibly consistent HRV monitoring device that reflects what you do over the course of an entire day. You can really see physiological patterns and changes.”
Mike has his All-Star client on WHOOP as well, but admits it was difficult to get him to wear it at first:",2/17/17
behind-the-scenes-with-an-nba-performance-coach,Behind the Scenes With an NBA Performance Coach,"“With pro athletes, you have to be extra patient. It can take them a while to get around to trying new stuff. They’re not thinking about that, they’re worried about other things. Sometimes I’d have to say to him ‘Where’s your band at? Where’s your band at?’ But now that he understands the value of it he’s been great about wearing it. I use analogies like crazy to explain things like like HRV and resting heart rate. I’ll say ‘If your resting heart rate is 65, that’s like a car idling at 5000 RPMs. You’re just overactive, there is something going on within your system.’ When you use analogies with people the lightbulb goes on.”
The WHOOP Sleep analysis and Recovery are what Mike finds to be most useful for coaching his athlete:
“If it shows he didn’t get enough sleep, or quality sleep, I’ll ask him to pay the sleep debt off by taking a nap. If we’re ever in the red we implement recovery strategies–more than we would in the yellow or green–several different types of protocol that I believe in. Recovery is such an important thing and we’re hitting it from all angles. With objective data you can really influence people’s behaviors.”
“He’ll say to me ‘Dude, when I look at how much sleep I need I put serious effort into making sure that I get it because WHOOP says so.’ That’s very powerful.”
It’s not just NBA players and superstar athletes who Mike recommends WHOOP too:
“Whenever I’m passionate or I believe in something I want to work with it. It’s about educating people to understand why knowledge is power; what’s going on inside your body matters. The impact this knowledge can have on your performance as a human being is tenfold. If you want to be elite, you have to have elite data. It doesn’t matter if you want to be an elite athlete, an elite CEO, an elite worker, it’s all about what you define as elite to yourself.”",2/17/17
benefits-of-meditation,Benefits of Meditation: Improve Awareness and Focus Attention,"How to Start Meditating to Improve Attention
Think about your attention like the lens through which you view the world. If the lens is out of focus or constantly bouncing from one scene to the next, we lose our ability to hone in on that which is most important to us. We begin to train our mind to only focus on tasks for moments or minutes at a time. Do you ever stop to notice how you are training your attention? Again, the way in which we train our mind matters just as much as how we train our bodies.
Meditation allows us to notice where we pay attention. Here are two simple techniques to practice:
### BOX-BREATHING (A BREATHING MEDITATION)
Begin by closing your eyes. Breathe in through your nose or mouth and count to 4 slowly.
Hold the breath inside while counting slowly to 4 again. Try to relax the muscles in your face.
Slowly exhale for 4 seconds.
Repeat steps 1 through 3 at least 3 times.
### MANTRA MEDITATION (A REPEATED-PHASE MEDITATION)
Begin by closing your eyes. Breathe in through your nose or mouth and repeat silently the word of your choice. For example, “Be.”
Breathe in through your nose or mouth and repeat silently another word of your choice. For example, “Here.”
Repeat steps 1 and 2 at least 3 times.",5/9/20
benefits-of-meditation,Benefits of Meditation: Improve Awareness and Focus Attention,"## Meditation and Training the Brain
We now have substantial scientific evidence that says we can. Wellness habits, such as meditation, promote our brain to change and rewire itself through a lifelong process termed neuroplasticity.
Essentially what this means is that we are not stuck with the brain that we have. Research in neuroplasticity shows that how we think and act shapes and changes our brain over time. This is why training the mind is equally as important as exercising the body.
A consistent meditation practice will lead to small improvements in our ability to focus, resulting in significant adaptations of the mind.
## Why Meditate?
Arguably one of the most rewarding parts of meditation is its ability to improve our attention. When we spend more time cultivating attention towards the present moment we are able to see life with more clarity, which allows us to recover from negative emotions and situations more quickly. Spending less time stressing leaves us feeling more energized and improves concentration, in turn leading to increased productivity and efficiency.
Upon starting a meditation practice, you will notice right away that the mind is often completely distracted by the past or future. Awareness is the first step in developing a more focused attention span. In meditation we are essentially taking one step backwards and observing thoughts objectively. If we observe our thoughts, by definition we are not those thoughts. But, how can we train our attention when we are constantly bombarded by information?",5/9/20
benefits-of-meditation,Benefits of Meditation: Improve Awareness and Focus Attention,"Attention Management: How to Create Deliberate and Concentrated Attention
“Attention management offers the ability to consciously direct our attention in any given moment, to be more proactive than reactive, and to maintain control rather than inadvertently relinquish it. It’s about regaining control over your attention and thereby taking control of your life. Attention management empowers your productivity.” – Maura Thomas
Attention is both a valuable and limited resource. What we pay attention to affects both our conscious and subconscious mind. The things we observe every day, whether consciously or not, subtly influence what we think about the world and ourselves.
For example, have you ever hopped onto Instagram or Facebook and moments later found yourself aimlessly wandering into a shopping cart? When we surrender our attention to whatever shines brightest, we give away our free will to an unconscious program.
With so much information and data readily available, who can blame us for bouncing from one thing to the next? A study by the World Economic Forum puts this into context by explaining that “the entire digital universe is expected to reach 44 zettabytes by the end of 2020. If this number is correct, it will mean there are 40 times more bytes than there are stars in the observable universe.” With that amount of information flying around, it is crucial for us to develop an ability to focus our attention so that we can choose what to put it towards.",5/9/20
benefits-of-meditation,Benefits of Meditation: Improve Awareness and Focus Attention,"When Should I Practice? Morning Meditation vs Night
Choosing a time to meditate is entirely up to you. Many meditators enjoy starting the day with morning meditation since the mind is fresh and less distracted by work and responsibilities. Before bed can also be a great time, especially if you tend to stress or clench your jaw while sleeping. By choosing a specific time, you begin to condition your body to habitually commit to the practice every day.
That being said, potential issues arise if we wake up late or fall asleep before practicing, which is why the most important part of practicing is consistency. If you know that you are going to work late, try to get your meditation in at lunchtime, even if it is just 2 minutes. Maintaining consistency with your practice will strengthen your ability to deal with any situation, no matter what life throws at you.
Start to challenge yourself to practice meditation when you’re feeling mentally fragmented–some of my most valuable meditations come from forcing myself to sit and meditate when it is the last thing my mind wants to do.",5/9/20
benefits-of-meditation,Benefits of Meditation: Improve Awareness and Focus Attention,"Meditation Benefits: How Do I Know if I’m Making Progress?
Historically, one of the most difficult parts of meditation is that the effects could only be detected through careful observation. Oftentimes my clients would feel like their practice was not progressing, which would lead to discouragement and lack of interest.
However, with products like WHOOP we are able to use data-driven feedback as a tool for progress management. It is important to reflect on your improvements so as to keep the mind engaged in your practice. Although most results are not as immediately obvious as improved heart rate variability, here are some signs of progress with your meditation that can create noticeable changes in your daily life:
Greater ability to focus on one task at a time
Increased metacognition
More time spent in the present moment versus daydreaming
Less time spent ruminating on future fears or past regrets
Reduced stress
Increased compassion for others
Finding it easier to let go of grudges and not stay angry
More aware of the thoughts that are on your mind
By logging meditations as activities in the WHOOP app, you can self-experiment and track how they impact your physiological data as well. I notice higher daily recovery scores, better sleep, and improved metrics like resting heart rate and HRV when my meditations are consistent!

### STEP 1: SET A REALISTIC AMOUNT OF TIME TO PRACTICE MINDFULNESS EVERY DAY
A lot of my clients struggle with maintaining a consistent practice because they create an unrealistic expectation for how much time they can commit to. Maybe it’s just one minute each day to start. Try that for 30 days and then move on to two minutes. That’s not to say that you cannot practice for longer, it’s just a way for you to succeed in forming the habit. I also suggest choosing a specific time to practice every day. Almost like brushing your teeth, you will begin to automatically crave this dedicated time. Eventually you’ll be able to use other techniques throughout your day to cultivate the skill of mindfulness.
### STEP 2: COMMIT TO THE PRACTICE
In the beginning, your time seated can often turn into daydreaming, problem solving, planning, or entertaining a variety of other mental distractions rather than remaining consistently engaged with the mindfulness technique. It is important to let go of all to-do lists and problems so that you can fully immerse yourself into the moment. Challenges and distractions are inevitable, but in committing to the practice you will begin to see them as opportunities for growth rather than obstacles to your success.
### STEP 3: LET GO OF EXPECTATIONS
Although setting goals and dedicating time is crucial in developing your practice, it is important to avoid expectations of where you think you should be. There is really no such thing as a bad meditation. Simply getting yourself to practice is, in and of itself, an accomplishment.

benefits-of-mindfulness,The Benefits of Mindfulness & How to Practice It,"Mindfulness and the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)
The ANS regulates our visceral system (the guts) and all basic functions of the body–it is the center of survival responses. It is composed of the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches and operates automatically, without our control. But, this does not mean that we can’t have influence over its function.
Given that our brains developed with the goal of survival rather than happiness, it is crucial for us to implement a daily practice of mindfulness. When we are able to calm the mind, we are able to see life from a place of clarity. We can then observe ourselves going through life and respond with intention, rather than react from fear.
## Why Practicing Mindfulness is So Useful During These Times
Both clinical research and neurobiologists have observed that many mindfulness techniques are extremely useful with respect to emotional difficulties, chronic pain and behavioral disorders. Mindfulness allows us to manage everyday physiological stress by reminding us to be aware and pay attention to the moment. When we stress about the future or ruminate about the past, our bodies do not know the difference–we release the same stress hormones as if we were literally being chased by a lion on the tundra, causing an increase in grey matter in the amygdala (fight or flight part of our brain).
Since our sympathetic (fight or flight) nervous system can be ignited simply by thought alone, it is imperative that we learn to let things go that we cannot control. On a scientific level, we see the effects of chronic stress manifest as lower heart rate variability (HRV), higher amounts of cortisol levels and frantic high beta brain waves.",4/17/20

One of the reasons why I really love WHOOP is because it incentivizes mindful choices. You can, for example, meditate before bed and then see a tangible difference in your HRV (and WHOOP recovery) the next day.

You can also log meditations as an activity and track other behaviors (like mindful breathing) in the WHOOP Journal in order to better understand how they impact your body.",4/17/20
benefits-of-mindfulness,The Benefits of Mindfulness & How to Practice It,"Mindfulness has many definitions. Dr. John Yates describes it as “the optimal interaction between attention and peripheral awareness.” In order to fully comprehend mindfulness, it is pivotal to first understand the unique functions of attention and peripheral awareness.
“Attention translates our raw experience of the world into terms we can more easily understand, which we then organize into a picture of reality,” Yates says. It is the part of our brain that helps us to decipher different objects or concepts–for example, a bush from a lion. On the other hand, “peripheral awareness is more concerned with the relationships of objects to each other, and to the whole.” I like to think of mindfulness as a spotlight that brings focused attention and understanding to the present moment.
Since our brains developed primarily as organs for survival, we are skilled at recalling trauma and disappointment. Our minds are like magnets for bad experiences, and teflon for good ones. Anything bad that happens in our lives sticks, while the good tends to fade away. Think about it like this: You meet with your coworker for a review and hear about 10 things that you’re doing great, but only one area of insufficiency. What is going to keep you up at night? Not the 10 positive things. Although this mentality is useful when we are experiencing an actual threat, it can cause a lot of unnecessary suffering in day-to-day life.
Think about how often we wish for more time to spend with family, or for less time stuck in traffic. Yet when faced with our current situation, it is so much easier to focus on all of the negatives. It is only natural that a new tendency of anxiety and depression may arise in the current zeitgeist. However, the ability to notice when we are ruminating on something that we cannot change and then let it go is something that can truly benefit our autonomic nervous system (ANS) and overall well being.",4/17/20

Work on simply becoming entirely aware of sound as a sensation. Realize that sounds come and go on their own and no effort is required to hear them. They just simply arise, like waves, washing over your ear drums. Notice if you hop on the bandwagon of one particular sound. It may capture you, and before you know it it takes you on a ride with its story.
Immediately upon understanding that you’ve become lost in a particular sound, come back to this moment and then gently move on to the next sound. Eventually all of these sounds begin to create a symphony of mindfulness, tuning us deeply and intimately into this moment, by way of our ears.",4/17/20

benefits-of-sleep-masks,8 Benefits to Wearing a Sleep Mask,"One of the best things you can do to improve the quality of your sleep may also be one of the easiest–just wear an eye mask to bed. Below we’ll explore how sleep masks work, their potential benefits, what to look for in choosing one, and the positive impact they have on WHOOP members’ sleep data.
## How Do Eye Masks Help You Sleep?
The basic premise of a sleep mask is very simply to block any light from reaching your eyes. Exposure to light when you’re trying to sleep confuses your circadian rhythm, the body’s 24-hour internal clock that regulates sleep patterns.
“Our circadian rhythms are essentially set by light,” states Emily Capodilupo, VP of Data Science and Research, on the WHOOP Podcast. “If you have even very small amounts of light in your bedroom you’re pretty much telling your body it’s daytime, which means don’t sleep, and you actually inhibit the production of the sleep promoting hormone melatonin.”
## Who Should Try a Sleep Mask?
Chances are, almost everyone can likely benefit from going to sleep with an eye mask on.
“Light impacts my sleep and there’s quite a bit of evidence to support that,” says WHOOP VP of Performance Kristen Holmes, also on our podcast. “I wear a mask to filter out all the light and make it dark, dark, dark. To me, that’s been a game changer in terms of my sleep data. You spend more time in deeper stages of sleep and you’re just not interrupted by light, which is going to wake you up.”
In particular, a sleep mask may be useful for anybody who:
Suffers from insomnia
Is a light sleeper
Works night shifts or has to sleep during the day

In order to get the most out of a sleep mask, it’s important to find the right one for you. Here are some key characteristics to look for:
Make sure you find it comfortable, easy to wear, and that it doesn’t bother you if you have sensitive skin
Check to see that it blocks out ALL light
Avoid masks that feel too tight–an adjustable strap may be useful
Get one that fits your sleeping style (for example, one that won’t slide off or put pressure on your face if you sleep on your side)
## Track the Impact of Wearing a Sleep Mask with WHOOP
With the WHOOP Journal feature you can log when you wear a mask to bed, as well as many other behaviors that can have an effect on how well you sleep. Along with detailed sleep tracking, WHOOP uses the data to give you actionable insights as to which things positively or negatively impact your sleep.

When WHOOP members report wearing a sleep mask there are substantial improvements in their sleep and next-day recovery. On average, their total time asleep increases by 27 minutes, they see a 2% gain in REM sleep, and their recovery is boosted by 9%.
Wearing a sleep mask improves WHOOP members sleep and recovery.
We found these stats to be generally consistent across all age groups, and for both men and women. Our analysis considered possible confounding factors as well, meaning we controlled for other behaviors to help you sleep (like wearing blue-light blocking glasses or reading before bed) that you might also engage in when wearing an eye mask.
Beyond more time asleep, increased REM sleep, and better recovery, here are 5 additional benefits of sleep masks:
Stop distractions and prevent you from viewing screened devices in bed. You’re not going to look at your phone or turn on the TV if you’ve got a mask on.

3. I-Y-T WITH RESISTANCE BAND OR TRX
These are great golf exercises to help build strong shoulders. Facing the high attachment, grab onto both handles of the TRX. Start in the full lean back row position–the closer to the attachment, the harder the exercise. Perform I’s, Y’s, T’s and W’s.
Start by bringing both of your arms (elbows locked) straight out to your sides with your thumbs pointing up, forming the letter “T” with your body. Next, try to bring both arms (elbows still locked) up above your shoulders to form the letter “Y.” Then, with shoulders and elbows bent to 90 degrees (forming the letter “L”), rotate the back of your hands to the sky keeping your shoulders bent. Finally, with your elbows slightly bent, arms out in front of your body and your thumbs pointing up, raise your arms to the sky to form a “W.”
Repeat each position for the prescribed number of reps. Remember to start each motion by squeezing your shoulder blades together.",6/24/22

Below are some great exercises and strength training workouts to get started with to improve your golf game, swing speed, and how you hit the ball. They focus on the major muscles listed above, with links to video tutorials of how each is done.
Before you dive into the workouts, here’s a little more on the basics of stretching for golf, as well as why getting out on the golf course is a great form of exercise–for professional golfers, senior golfers, and everyone in between.
### 1. BOX SQUATS
1. BOX SQUATS
This exercise builds strength and power in the legs. Start by standing tall with a box or chair placed directly behind you. Perform a squat with your weight equal on both sides. Slowly go down until you are sitting on the box. Return up to the starting position and repeat. Decrease the height of the box or chair as you become more advanced.
### 2. CHOP
2. CHOP
This will help increase upper body strength, shoulder and spine range of motion, and overall core stability. To perform this exercise, you are going to need your functional movement trainer or a cable cross machine and a bar attachment (a triceps rope can be an alternative to the bar). Get into a half kneeling position with your down knee away from the machine or the door. Grab the FMT or bar with both hands on top of the bar and keep your posture as tall as possible.
Perform a chop diagonally across your body, keeping your hands and the bar close to your chest throughout the movement. Make a full shoulder turn as you chop, and slowly return to the starting position. Repeat the appropriate number of sets and reps.",6/24/22

4. TURKISH GET UP
Excellent total body exercises for strength and golf fitness. Start without weight, using just your shoe at first, then progress to weight. Lie down next to a kettlebell and roll to your left side facing it. The kettlebell should be within comfortable reach of your left arm. Grab it with your left hand and roll yourself onto your back bringing the kettlebell with you. Bend your left knee and place your foot flat on the ground. Press the kettlebell directly up in front of your chest, extending your arm completely.
Next, place your right arm down by your side to help perform the get-up. Now, the first motion is a curl-up crunch to get up to your right elbow. It helps to drive through your left heel as well. If you combine this with lengthening through your right heel, it will be much easier to keep your right leg straight and fairly flat on the ground.
Then, shift your weight from your right elbow to your right hand, keeping the bell directly vertical. From the “on the hand” position, you’re going to actively drive through your left heel into a bridge. The key here is getting hip extension as opposed to lumbar spine extension.
From the high bridge position, sweep your right leg back to a point where your right knee is on the ground underneath your body. Keep your lumbar spine neutral throughout.
Now, rotate your right lower leg so it’s straight and in line with your body, and straighten your trunk so you’re up tall. Once you’re in the “tall half-kneeling” position, it’s an opportune time to refocus with chest up, long spine, shoulder packed, etc.
Lastly, perform a split squat to stand tall, and you are at the top position. To return to the ground, just reverse the direction going back. Then repeat with your other arm.",6/24/22

best-stretches-before-running,The Best Stretches to Do Before Running,"As the world changes its work and fitness routines during a global pandemic, one tried and true activity has gained momentum above the rest: Running. Unlike most sports, running doesn’t require much. You need a good pair of running shoes, some sweat-wicking clothing, and a bit of mental fortitude. And of course, 6 feet of space between you and the next person running along the bike path.
While running is a simple, meditative sport, we mustn’t forget how important the smaller details are–most notably stretching. Warm up routines involving dynamic stretches and technical drills activate our muscles and help prevent injury. A 2007 Sports Medicine study showed that at least 30% of injuries coming through clinics are skeletal muscular, and that goes for both professional and recreational athletes.
Whether you’re a seasoned athlete looking to start running again, or you’re just looking for new ways to stay fit, the following stretching routine will get your blood flowing, activate your neuromuscular system, and help you focus on form and technique prior to your run.",4/16/20

Many runners want to know, “Why should I use WHOOP over my GPS watch?” The reality is, the two are not mutually exclusive, and it’s important to understand that WHOOP is not meant to be a GPS watch. Instead, WHOOP helps runners monitor their cardiovascular effort (strain), daily recovery, and sleep performance so they can avoid overtraining, prevent injury, and peak for their next racing competition. You can wear both as you look to track mileage and get the most accurate summary of your physiological performance.
For any runner looking to challenge themselves, improve fitness, and avoid injury, WHOOP can help with the following:
Manage cardiovascular effort: WHOOP heart rate monitoring shows which training zones you’re hitting, so you know if you’re pushing too hard on an easy run, or reaching anaerobic zones during your interval workouts.

What is dynamic stretching? Dynamic stretching focuses on joint mobility and movement, as opposed to static stretching, which focuses on isolating muscle groups and holding a stretch for up to 30 seconds.
Before each run, you should spend at least 15 minutes going through intentional warm-up stretches and drills. When you view your warm up as an essential, disciplined part of being a good athlete, you will reap the benefits and prevent injury in the long-term.

5. Get Exercise
Go for a run while you’re outside, go to the gym or do an at-home workout. Exercise increases endorphins and raises body temperature, which might be why those morning people are so chipper before we’ve gotten out of bed. Doing a 40-minute aerobic workout at any time of the day except right before bed will help you sleep better, thus enabling you to wake up easier.
### 6. Prepare For the Morning the Night Before
6. Prepare For the Morning the Night Before
Give yourself as little to do in the morning as possible by getting it all done the night before. Before you go to bed, prep the coffee machine, make the lunches and find the kids’ shoes. Get your work bag ready and put your keys and transit pass with it. Prepare so you only have to do the bare minimum the next morning.
Finally, if setting your blaring alarm makes you dread mornings, try a silent alarm.

7. WHOOP Sleep Planner and Haptic Alerts
Waking up to an obnoxious noise can have a number of unintended consequences. Loud audio alarms may cause high blood pressure and increased heart rates. They can also add anxiety to the existential dread of waking up. There are several benefits to a silent alarm, including decreasing sleep inertia.
WHOOP 4.0 includes an updated Sleep Planner with haptic alerts that wake you using gentle vibrations on your wrist for a more pleasant experience than a blaring alarm.
The Sleep Planner gives you three options to help you plan your sleep so you can wake at the optimal time based on your sleep needs. You can set the haptic alert for the exact time you need to get up, when you’ve reached your nightly sleep goal, or to wake you when you’re “in the green” and optimally recovered.

1. Create a Morning Routine
It takes time to build habits and create a routine, but starting small can help lead to larger changes. Here are a few minor tweaks that may help start the day.
Get up at the same time every day. The first change to try is waking up at the same time every day, even on your days off. You may not like getting up at 6 am on a Saturday, but rising early on your days off will help you feel less tired on workdays. It will also ensure you’re sleepy around the same time each night. Working on sleep consistency helps you reset your internal clock, so you aren’t feeling sleep deprived every morning.
Let the sunshine in. When you get up, open the curtains and let the morning sun revive you. You may notice you’re more tired on gloomy mornings. This is because the blue light of morning boosts alertness for the same reasons you want to avoid blue light in the evening. If you use blackout curtains or blinds in your bedroom, open them up in the morning and let in sunlight. If you don’t want to wake a partner, step outside into the sunlight for a moment or sit in a sunny room.
Water. Splash cold water on your face and drink water before caffeinating. Cold water causes an immediate sympathetic reaction meant to startle you away from a possible threat. Your adrenal gland releases adrenaline to jolt you into alertness.
Water may also help you wake up more than your choice of morning caffeine. Two 2019 studies show that hydration helps improve mental performance and that dehydration negatively affects short-term memory and attention. Drinking water in the morning after fasting for 8 hours may help boost mental performance even without caffeine.
Finally, a warm (not hot) morning shower may boost alertness by raising your body temperature gradually.",10/2/21
best-ways-to-wake-up-feeling-recovered,7 Best Ways to Wake Up Feeling Refreshed in the Morning,"Waking up is hard to do. Some of us night owls have always struggled to get the early worm. We prefer sleeping through the sunrise and drink our morning coffee in wonder at those people who are up before dawn for their morning run.
But, waking can be difficult for people who go to bed at a reasonable hour too. Feeling sluggish in the morning even after a cup of coffee is common. According to one 2020 study, 65% of Americans rarely wake up rested and energized and daytime tiredness negatively affects 75%of respondents’ productivity.
Getting enough sleep is one major way to tackle daytime lethargy and morning grumpiness (check out our best techniques to fall asleep fast). But feeling refreshed in the morning isn’t only about what you do the night before. You don’t need to be a morning person to feel energized when you wake up. Below are seven tips on how to wake up feeling rested, recovered, and ready for the day.
## What Happens When We Wake?
Waking is controlled by two processes, the wake/sleep homeostasis and your circadian rhythm. Homeostasis means the longer you stay awake, the greater your body feels the need to sleep. Your circadian rhythm, however, causes highs and lows throughout the day of wakefulness and sleepiness. Adults are generally most tired between 2-3 am and 1-3 pm (which is why we all want an afternoon nap). Getting plenty of sleep helps balance the lows with the highs.
Your circadian rhythm is controlled by an area of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), located in the hypothalamus. This area is sensitive to light and dark signals received from the eyes. The SCN triggers the release of cortisol and other hormones that wake you in the morning, as well as melatonin in the evening.",10/2/21
best-ways-to-wake-up-feeling-recovered,7 Best Ways to Wake Up Feeling Refreshed in the Morning,"2. Don’t Check Your Phone
2. Don’t Check Your Phone
Plenty of us wake in the morning with our phone alarms and immediately begin checking texts, social media, emails, etc. But, this may do more harm than good. Checking work emails or social media may trigger your stress response and put you on edge while you’re still half asleep.
Your brain has been busy all night moving through different states of sleep to file away memories and prepare your body for the next day. At that first alarm, your brain activity begins switching from delta waves of deep sleep to theta waves of drowsy wakefulness–you’re awake but not very good at processing information. Scrolling in the morning can force your body to skip over the theta waves and bull straight into wakeful, alert beta waves.
However, you need that theta state, it’s where we have ideas and visualize plans and actions.
So, when the alarm sounds, turn it off, get up and put the phone down.
### 3. Don’t Hit Snooze
3. Don’t Hit Snooze
Avoid hitting the snooze button on your alarm clock or phone. Pressing snooze and going back to sleep tells your body that it’s OK to begin another sleep cycle. If you do this multiple times, your brain and body will get confused. You may be groggier than you would be if you’d gotten up with the alarm in the first place. Set the alarm to a realistic time and just get up.
### 4. Go Outside During the Day
4. Go Outside During the Day
You don’t have to go outside when the rooster crows, but going for a walk or even sitting outside for 5-15 minutes (more in the winter) will get you some Vitamin D. This helps you absorb other minerals, boosts your immune system, aids the production of blood cells and strengthens bones. Sunlight also helps decrease anxiety by boosting serotonin, letting you stay calm and focus. Plus, there are all those benefits of morning sunshine we mentioned above.",10/2/21

Lawson battled through the treacherous cobblestones of Roubaix in Stage 09, aided by his first green Recovery in a week (75%) and his highest since the Tour began.
“That one was really rough on the body,” he told us. “I was mentally prepared to fight and help the team out today, but when the flag dropped my nerves got the better of me. My day pretty much turned into pure survival once the race started. While my shoulder was stable, I still felt every cobblestone that I rode over. It was suffering like I’ve never experienced before. I’m very happy to make it to the rest day tomorrow, and look forward to getting into the mindset of contributing to the team.”
What’s Lawson’s plan for the rest day prior to Stage 10?
“Tomorrow will be entirely focused on rehab and recovery, he said. “My body took quite a beating today, so we’ll have to pay a lot of attention to it tomorrow. Plus, I’ll just take a moment or two to really relax. The last nine days have been extremely stressful.”",7/5/18

Today’s Stage 12, from Bourg-Saint-Maurice Les Arcs to Alpe d’Huez, concluded with what many refer to as “the greatest climb in cycling.” “Legendary” and “iconic” are the words regularly used to describe the breathtaking 13.8-kilometer stretch featuring 21 switchbacks and an average gradient of 8.1%.
Riders also took on the Alpe d’Huez on the heels of two epic HC climbs earlier in the stage (climbs are categorized from 5 to 1, Category 1 being the steepest with the exception of HC, which comes from the French term “Hors Categorie,” meaning “above category”).
Yesterday, Lawson’s coach Jim Miller said the pain in his shoulder was causing him to struggle both with right hand turns and getting out of the saddle to accelerate uphill–neither of which boded well for what he faced today. Additionally, Lawson mentioned that the continued efforts were beginning to take their toll.
Yet somehow, Lawson once again overcame all the odds.
After logging Strains of 20+ in each of the last three days, Lawson astonishingly posted a 60% Recovery this morning heading into today’s brutal stage. He went on to finish 42nd overall out of the 153 riders remaining in the race, by far his best showing to date. He did so with a 20.7 Strain, also his highest of the Tour.
“Lawson reported he felt much more like himself again,” Miller told us. “He really felt good on the Col de la Madeleine and Col de la Croix de Fer [the stage’s two HC climbs].”
Amongst a string of spectacular performances, today’s took it to a whole other level. Lawson went from simply hoping to survive each day to actually thriving in the toughest stage yet.

There aren’t many chances left for the GC contenders, so this will be an action-packed final week.”
With six days remaining, Lawson remains focussed on his one clear goal–finishing.
“As it’s been for the first two weeks, it’ll be a big fight for me to make it to Paris,” he said. “At this point I can almost see the Eiffel Tower, but the hardest days are still ahead of me.

With 8 hours and 12 minutes of sleep last night, Lawson managed a 67% Recovery this morning. Through two weeks of the Tour, he’s done a remarkable job keeping his Recoveries out of the red:
“I would say it was a fairly controlled day,” Lawson’s coach Jim Miller said in reference to today’s Stage 14, “and probably not terrible for him in the back. Lawson told me last night that the peloton is smashed after the alps and everyone is pedaling squares.”
Lawson’s Recovery this morning was just 25%, no surprise after three straight days with Strains of 20.5 or higher.
“Today was a relatively routine day for the peloton,” he told us. “There were a lot of tired legs (including mine) after three incredibly difficult stages in the Alps. My main focus was just on making it to the finish safely, and without spending too much energy.”

Just 19 miles into today’s stage, Lawson’s heart rate dipped dramatically for an extending period of time, dropping as low as 94 beats per minute. What happened?
The race was stopped for roughly 15 minutes when farmers protesting a decrease in funding from the European Union threw bales of hay into the road. A police officer attempted to spray the protesters with tear gas, but winds blew it into the eyes of several riders in the peloton.
“One minute the race was full gas, and next thing we know we’re riding through hay bales across the road and police are forcing some people to the ground,” Lawson told us. “Then the pepper spray hit and no one could see or breathe for a brief moment. Fortunately, they neutralized the race and handled everything very well. It was one of the most bizarre situations I’ve ever been involved in during a race.”
Officially Lawson completed Stage 16 in just under 5 hours and 45 minutes, but he was on the bike today for well over 6 hours. “Tomorrow is going to be a tough one,” his coach Jim Miller said, “but he should get through the stage and be lined up for Paris.”

“Lawson made it to the second rest day and I don’t think anyone expected that following Stage 01,” his coach Jim Miller said. “Yesterday’s Stage 15 appeared on paper to be a bit of a transitional stage, but anyone who has raced bikes in the Carcassonne region of L’Aude knows how consistent the wind can blow in this area. The final two hours proved to not be easy at all.”",7/5/18

Fueled by his highest Recovery (48%) since Sunday, Lawson had his best finish yet in Stage 08. However, in Stage 09 tomorrow, 22k of cobblestones await on the ride from Arras to Roubaix. It’s a brutal stretch of roads for any cyclist to handle and not something most are accustomed to–let alone one competing with a fractured shoulder.
“Tomorrow is the big day,” said Lawson’s coach Jim Miller. “If he can get through it, then he has a chance at going to distance.”

Lawson completed Stage 07 today, spending more than six hours on the bike. It was a long, mostly flat stage referred to as “boring” by a number of riders. With a full week of the Tour now in the books, here’s a look at Lawson’s Strain and Recovery through the first seven days:
The only day Lawson didn’t post a Strain pushing 20 was during Monday’s team time trial, which lasted less than an hour. He seems to have found a bit of a groove, keeping his Recoveries consistently in the yellow despite the enormous amount of Strain he’s taking on.
Lawson has managed to pull this off in part by drastically improving his nightly sleep performances:

biometric-data-tour-france-lawson-craddock,Fitness Monitor for Cycling Shares Biometric Data of Tour de France,"“My biggest focus yesterday was on my recovery,” Lawson added. “I’ve been seriously lacking sleep since I crashed, so I made it a priority to get as much as I could last night. I got to bed immediately after dinner, and was able to get about 9 hours of quality sleep before being woken up for doping control. This was a huge factor today, I felt considerably better than the previous days. I was even able to get out of the saddle every so often for the first time, and I could feel my body starting to really respond to the treatment I’ve received. I’ll take today as a small victory and hope that this trend continues!”
Lawson managed 9 hours and 40 minutes in bed last night, a major improvement over the past several days. It may have been the difference in helping him hang on and see another day. He’s willing his body to do just enough to stay in the race, while also trying to heal in the process.

Lawson gutted out another strong performance today, hanging with the peloton for most of the stage. Here’s what his coach Jim Miller had to say about the challenges Lawson faced in fighting through his shoulder injury:
“The second half of today’s race was very fast and relentless. For Lawson, this spelled trouble as he continues to recover from his fractured scapula. In the event there is sudden braking, which there always is, he doesn’t want to be unable to brake and crash again. In the back of the peloton he feels its accordion effect much more than the riders near the front do. That means Lawson does roughly twice as many little deceleration/accelerations as he would if he were positioned near the front. Because of his injury he’s also unable to get out of the saddle and stand up to accelerate, so as he decelerates and accelerates he has to do it all with just his legs. As the day, and for that matter the week, wear on, this will really begin to take a toll.”",7/5/18

In 2017, a bout with overtraining derailed Lawson’s competitive season. He shared his story with us, and with the help of WHOOP gained a greater understanding of strain and recovery that let him get back on the right track in 2018.
Now, Lawson returns to cycling’s biggest stage, the Tour de France. We’ll be there every step of the way, with daily updates of his Recovery, Strain, Sleep, HRV and more as he competes in one of the most grueling events in all of sports.
### Houilles – Paris Champs-Élysées
He’s done it.
Today, Lawson Craddock officially completed the 2018 Tour de France.
“I’m blown away that Lawson finished this race,” his coach Jim Miller told us. “I didn’t give him a huge chance of this happening. Hats off to him and his resilience. I don’t think there is any question how bad he wanted this and how much it meant to him.”
“WHOOP was an important part of his season,” Miller added, “returning from a horrendous 2017 and ultimately earning a spot on the Tour team.”

After a “low” Strain day yesterday, Lawson’s Recovery bounced back to 65% this morning. It was enough to help him get through the last big test the Tour had to offer–three major climbs with an elevation gain of nearly 16,000 feet.

For the first time in nearly a week, Tour riders didn’t have to deal with excessive mountain climbs. In today’s sprint stage, Lawson came out hard and did his best to hang with the leaders for as long as he could.
“It was a great day for Lawson,” his coach Jim Miller told us. “He got off the back and was part of a group early in the race that attempted to bridge to the break. I knew he had been thinking about giving it a go, so it was nice to see him try.”
Through the first half of the Tour Lawson did an incredible job keeping his Recoveries up, but as the race grinds on it’s clear from his data that the heavy Strain load is starting to take its toll (the 73% Recovery on July 24 was following a rest day):
“Tomorrow is the beast,” Miller added, “if he comes through that day then he’s home free.”

Today’s stage was quite short, just over 40 miles in length. However, it featured three massive climbs, including one right out of the gate, something riders are not generally accustomed to.
Here’s what Lawson’s coach Jim Miller had to say about it:",7/5/18
biometric-data-tour-france-lawson-craddock,Fitness Monitor for Cycling Shares Biometric Data of Tour de France,"Yesterday, Lawson mentioned that his efforts were beginning to take their toll on him physically, particularly as his body tries to heal itself under the stress of intense competition. You can see this trend in his daily HRV:
“The first week definitely wasn’t what I envisioned it would be,” Lawson told us. “I’ve spent the better part of the week rehabbing my shoulder from crashing on the first day. My body’s ability to recover from the Tour de France has taken a back seat to my fractured shoulder blade. But even though it hasn’t been a great situation, every step has been more or less the best-case scenario. I’ve come leaps and bounds in regards to my injuries, and this has given me great hope going forwards. These next two days before the rest day will be crucial in my fight to reach Paris.”
After a second consecutive night of 8+ hours of sleep, this morning Lawson had his best Recovery (46%) in four days. He fought through another long day of riding, spending 4 hours and 53 minutes on the bike and posting a Strain over 18 for the sixth straight day.
“Following yesterday Lawson was really upbeat,” his coach Jim Miller said. “He was able to get out of the saddle, the pain has reduced quite significantly and overall he feels that he’s heading in the right direction. However, he did acknowledge that the effort is starting to take its toll. With a couple of sprint days coming up, he should be in good shape for now. The real test is what to do with Stage 09 and the cobblestones. That’s a question I think Lawson’s medical team will need to discuss and answer over the next few days.”

“I’m doing better.”
“After yesterday, I was quite worried about today,” Lawson told us. “The last 100 kilometers were really tricky with small roads, twists and turns, and loads of climbs,” he said, brutal things for a cyclist to handle while trying to compete with a fracture bone in his shoulder.",7/5/18
biometric-data-tour-france-lawson-craddock,Fitness Monitor for Cycling Shares Biometric Data of Tour de France,"Despite his most strenuous ride of the Tour yesterday, Lawson still managed a yellow Recovery this morning after getting nearly eight hours of sleep. He needed it.
“It was a nasty day,” his coach Jim Miller told us. “The stage had 11,000 feet of climbing, over which Lawson posted a 261 TSS and a 308w NP for 4 hours and 10 minutes. And with all that, he still finished 26 minutes behind the stage winner. It is hard to convey just how good these guys are.”
“Lawson told me that his real problem right now is handling the accelerations uphill,” Miller added. “He can’t really get out of the saddle and generate a ton of power, and he’s also struggling with right hand turns. The muscle group in his injured left shoulder is responsible for controlling that movement. But he is very motivated to finish this tour now, so we can expect that he is going to make the gruppettos (check yesterday’s Stage 10 journal for an explanation) every day.”
As more and more riders fail to make the time cut and get knocked out of the race, Lawson keeps soldiering on.

Following a much-needed rest day, Lawson awoke this morning with a 70% Recovery, in the green for the second time in the past three days.
“While I’ve made improvements in my recovery, I’m still quite sore from the Roubaix stage,” he told us. “Today was a rough day for me. I felt better than expected on the first climb, but that feeling was short lived. I suffered over the second mountain pass, but once we hit Col de Romme I was cooked. I struggled mightily to maintain contact with the gruppetto, and forced myself to only look at the next kilometer.”",7/5/18
biometric-data-tour-france-lawson-craddock,Fitness Monitor for Cycling Shares Biometric Data of Tour de France,"It will be quite a test for Lawson to compete tomorrow. He posted a 20.3 Day Strain after a red Recovery, and incurred a good portion of that Strain with a fractured scapula. Sleeping tonight with his shoulder injury may be difficult. His body will also be trying to heal itself, on top of recovering from his efforts. No doubt he’s drained mentally and emotionally as well. The deck appears stacked against him, how will his body respond to the challenge?
Whatever tomorrow holds, we’re rooting for you Lawson. We’re in awe of the work that got you here and the grit you showed today. Good luck tomorrow.

“I’m definitely looking forward to getting the Tour started tomorrow,” Lawson told us. “It’s really in the days leading up to the Grand Depart that you realize the magnitude of this particular race. While all you want to do is lay on your bed and relax, your days are quite stressful with a packed schedule including press conferences, interviews and team presentation. It’s almost a relief when you wake up on race day and realize the real reason why you came to France. And then the real stress begins… I can’t wait!”",7/5/18
biometric-data-tour-france-lawson-craddock,Fitness Monitor for Cycling Shares Biometric Data of Tour de France,"“It was pretty much the best case scenario,” Lawson added. “At the end of the day we finished 6th on the stage, a great result for us. It gives me a lot of confidence going into tomorrow.”
Yesterday, Lawson said he was very nervous about the TTT and wasn’t sure he’d be able to keep up during one of the Tour’s fastest stages. Miller noted that a few nights of bad sleep could really set a rider back. Amazingly, Lawson was able to will himself across the line today after getting just 55% of the 10 hours and 55 minutes of sleep his body needed last night. Can he buck this trend heading into Stage 04?
“Tonight will be more of the same in terms of trying to recover,” he said. “Once we get to the hotel it will be straight to Rabin to continue the work on the soft tissue, and then dinner to refuel for the remainder of the race. Every day is going to be a new challenge for me, but the support I have received from everyone has motivated and inspired me beyond words.”

“The next few days won’t be easy by any stretch, but I know I’m in good hands.”
As a pro athlete, there’s nothing more heartbreaking than spending your life training for a moment, only to have it go completely opposite of how you planned. For Lawson, yesterday was not about the physical pain of the injuries he sustained–it was about the mental hurdles he had to overcome in order to push forward.
“I’ve dealt with pain my whole life,” Lawson told us, “and have been able to make a career out of it. It was the mental aspect of seeing the X-rays to confirm I had fractured my scapula that was the toughest to deal with. Seeing the separation of the bones on that black and white screen felt like someone had just put a knife into my heart.”",7/5/18
biometric-data-tour-france-lawson-craddock,Fitness Monitor for Cycling Shares Biometric Data of Tour de France,"Miller added that Lawson was able to make it to the final 36k before he started “yoyo-ing” off the back of the peloton. He came off for good at 22k to go, losing 3 minutes and 48 seconds.
“Considering what he’s dealing with, it was a great ride. It really shows how well prepared he was coming into this Tour,” Miller said.
Lawson was able to get his Recovery back in the yellow this morning, aided by 6 hours and 12 minutes of sleep, the most he’s gotten since the Tour began (although still a ways off from what his body needs). Check back tomorrow to see if he can keep trending in the right direction!

Despite the continued pain of the fracture in his shoulder, another rough night’s sleep and a 30% Recovery this morning, Lawson performed remarkably in Stage 03, helping his team EF Education First – Drapac p/b Cannondale to a sixth-place finish (39’21) in today’s extremely fast team time trial.
“Lawson did so much more than anyone expected of him today,” said his coach Jim Miller. “The thing about Lawson is he doesn’t like to let anyone down, so he clearly gave as much as he had to give. He ended up riding 32k [of the 35.5k] with the team, with a NP of 405w and had 14 peak powers above 700w. That’s solid without a fractured scapula, but even more impressive given what he was working with. He really should not have been able to do that, it was unbelievable.”
“This morning was another rough one,” Lawson told us. “I woke up stiff as a corpse and took a while to loosen up. Between waking up and the start I pretty much spent all my free time with either our chiropractor, Matt Rabin, or our doctor, Kevin Sprouse. They helped loosen up the muscles surrounding my shoulder as much as possible and that ended up making the biggest difference during the TTT. While I still wasn’t pain free, I was at least able to manage the pain and this allowed me to contribute to the team.”",7/5/18
biometric-data-tour-france-lawson-craddock,Fitness Monitor for Cycling Shares Biometric Data of Tour de France,"Unfortunately for Lawson, the first stage did not go as planned. He awoke with a red Recovery after a subpar night’s sleep, pinned an unlucky No. 13 to his jersey before the race, and later suffered a hard crash in the first feed station.

“Stage 01 was all going according to plan until the feed zone,” Lawson told us. “A rider dropped a full bottle in the middle of the road, and with our tires being only 25mm wide it might as well have been a hand grenade when I hit it full on. I rocketed off the road, hit a spectator, and flew over the bars into a ditch. I ended up getting back on the bike, and suffered all the way to the finish. After doping control (part of the job…) and X-rays it was revealed I had a fracture in my scapula. Not an ideal start to the Tour de France. Our doctors say that it is stable, and as long as I can ride safely and not put others in danger than I might be able to continue. I will give it my best go today and fight as much as I can.”
Lawson credited his teammates for being incredibly supportive in helping him finish. Notice in the video below he’s wearing his No. 13 upside down, something cyclists do to avoid bad luck when they draw that number.

“I’m not just going home at the first sign of adversity,” Lawson said. “So I’ll see how I feel tonight, how I sleep, how I feel in the morning and get on the bike and see if I can manage it.”",7/5/18
biometric-data-tour-france-lawson-craddock,Fitness Monitor for Cycling Shares Biometric Data of Tour de France,"Last night, Lawson did everything he could to prepare for Stage 02. Armed with a world-class medical team and supportive teammates, he focused on the facts: He was fit, he knew his body, and he knew what he needed to do to recover.
This morning, he woke up in the green with an elevated HRV of 109 and a low RHR of 41, both solid results relative to Lawson’s usual baselines. While that may seem surprising for a guy who just raced 120 miles and sustained injuries, according to WHOOP physiologists, the markers are not unexpected and the sign of a well-trained body waiting to do its work.
“It was an encouraging sign to see my HRV and recovery bounce back today,” Lawson added. “Especially when I knew what I was in store for. One thing that I have noticed since tracking my HRV with WHOOP is that I often have a delayed reaction in terms of recovery. I can finish a hard training block, take a day easy, and still have a poor recovery. It’s not usually until I jump back into training or racing that my recovery scores will jump up. This has been very useful info when it comes to planning my training with my coach, Jim Miller, heading into a big event.”
Lawson’s Sleep Performance, obviously impacted by the discomfort of his injuries, was poor. According to Miller, this is something they will have to keep an eye on, as “A couple nights of that and you put yourself in a big hole.”
Lawson completed Stage 02 today with a 4:26 race time, a Strain of 20.5, 275 NP and 221 TSS. He now looks ahead at the daunting task of tomorrow’s Team Time Trial–a flat out 100% effort to help the team AND get himself to the finish line within the day’s time cut.
We’re honored to follow his journey as he competes, and we’re amazed by his resilience.

boost-immune-system-with-sleep,Making Sleep Your No. 1 Priority Can Help Prevent & Overcome Illness,"Track Your Sleep and Other Behaviors with WHOOP
In a recent study done by the University of Arizona and published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, WHOOP was proven to accurately measure sleep and identify sleep’s various stages. Having a tool like WHOOP to quantify how much REM sleep you are getting and how much sleep debt your body is experiencing could be critical to managing health.
In preparation for World Sleep Day 2019, we polled 100 of the best sleepers on WHOOP and asked them for their best sleep tips and tricks. Their advice ranged from snuggling your dog (a personal favorite) to maintaining a reliable pre-bed routine, to using various supplements and products.
While the advice of champion sleepers is definitely worth a read during this time in which sufficient sleep might be more valuable than ever, it is important to pay attention to what’s working and not working for you personally. WHOOP members can use the new Journal feature, launched earlier this week, to track a wide and customizable list of potentially sleep-influencing behaviors (including the immune system boosters listed above) in order to understand on a personal level what drives green recoveries, peak sleep performance and better overall health.",3/14/20
boost-immune-system-with-sleep,Making Sleep Your No. 1 Priority Can Help Prevent & Overcome Illness,"Sleep as a Natural Way to Improve Immune System
Another study, published last year in the Journal of Experimental Medicine and led by Stoyan Dimitrov, showed that a good night’s sleep can boost the effectiveness of T cells, a specialized white blood cell responsible for activating the immune system to fight infection. T cells do their job with the help of a special immune system protein called integrins, which allow the T cells to bind to their targets.
Dimitrov and his team showed that integrin activation happened at a higher rate during sleep than during wake, suggesting that the immune system is better at identifying threats while you’re asleep than while you’re awake.
Most people who come down with COVID-19 experience mild symptoms, but in severe cases it causes pneumonia. While there are many kinds of pneumonias, a Harvard study led by Dr. Sanjay Patel found that in a sample of almost 57,000 women, getting fewer than 5 hours of sleep vs more than 8 hours explained a 70% difference in the incidence of pneumonia. It is important to note that they were not specifically looking at pneumonia associated with COVID-19, however the reduced immune system functioning that made these short-sleeping women vulnerable might be a valuable cautionary tale.
## Other Ways to Boost Immune System
Additional things you can do to boost your immune system beyond getting more sleep include:
Eliminating alcohol
Increasing your intake of zinc and Vitamins B6, C, and E
Exercising regularly
Managing stress and anxiety
Eating a healthy, whole-foods diet
Hydrating well
Making changes to benefit your immune system and improve your sleep will certainly not guarantee you avoid the coronavirus, but they will undoubtedly improve your overall well-being during this uncertain period.",3/14/20
boost-immune-system-with-sleep,Making Sleep Your No. 1 Priority Can Help Prevent & Overcome Illness,"Why Lack of Sleep Weakens the Immune System
When we sleep, our bodies repair and restore vital systems that help keep us alive. This includes muscular, skeletal, and cellular repair during our REM stages of sleep. If we are not getting adequate REM sleep, our bodies will not recover and we will be more susceptible to illness.
While examining the relationship between sleep and response to cold virus exposure, the lead author of the UC San Francisco study explains that partial sleep deprivation reduces immune parameters critical to fighting infections. Other studies have also demonstrated that the active immune system is extremely energy-dependent, and the reduced energy demands during sleep allow us allocate additional energy resources towards the immune system.",3/14/20

As world-wide anxiety builds around the spread of coronavirus, one behavior that has been proven time and time again to reduce the incidence and intensity of disease is getting sufficient sleep.
In honor of World Sleep Day, and because sleep may be particularly important during a potential pandemic, we’ll dive into the science behind the relationship between sleep and immunity.
## The Connection Between Sleep and Immunity
While the COVID-19 disease and the novel coronavirus that causes it are new and therefore relatively poorly understood and understudied, research by Dr. Aric Prather out of UC San Francisco on another type of Coronavirus – the common cold – demonstrated that “people who sleep six hours a night or less are four times more likely to catch a cold when exposed to the virus, compared to those who spend more than seven hours a night in slumber land.”
Although people may naturally assume that a relationship exists between sleep and immunity, the study was able to show just how strong this relationship is–much greater than the relationship between the risk of developing a cold and alcohol consumption, smoking, or other markers of health including BMI and self-reported stress.",3/14/20
borg-scale-perceived-exertion-rpe,Overview of the Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion,"## What Is the Borg RPE Scale?
How do you know if you’re working out too hard, or not pushing yourself hard enough? A metric commonly used by coaches, athletes and trainers to track the intensity of exercise is the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) Scale, or Borg Scale for short.
## Origin of the Borg RPE Scale
Swedish professor Gunnar Borg first introduced the concept of perceived exertion in the 1960s. Simply put, perceived exertion is how hard you believe your body is working at any given time. Borg continued to study it through the 1970s, and in 1982 he published a paper containing his RPE scale. Here is the original RPE chart that appeared in that paper:
## How Does it Work?
The Borg Scale asks you to rate your level of perceived exertion during any activity from 6-20, with 6 being no effort at all and 20 being your all-out max. What number best describes your effort?
Your RPE is defined by several things you experience while exercising, including increased heart rate, faster breathing, sweating and overall fatigue. It’s important to focus on the combination of everything and do your best to disregard any one specific factor, like pain in a joint or muscle.
Why is it 6-20? Borg developed his RPE scale to represent an estimate of what your heart rate is when you multiply the number by 10. For example, if you go for a light jog and rate your exertion a 13, your heart rate is likely in the neighborhood of 130.",6/18/19
borg-scale-perceived-exertion-rpe,Overview of the Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion,"Training with the Borg Scale
Borg’s RPE scale was not intended simply for athletics. Among other things, it can be quite useful in terms of occupational health and safety for workers performing physical labor. However, it has become most popular in the fields of sports science and sports medicine, and is often used to help put together training regimens.
Here’s an example of how an athlete might plan a week’s worth of exertion while training for a big event. In this case, Monday and Thursday are the rest days, with Friday being the day to really push it:
What makes the Borg Scale particularly effective for monitoring exercise intensity is that it’s a relative scale applied specifically to you. To measure your training progress, use the Borg Scale to gauge how much effort it takes to perform a certain workout or activity. As your fitness improves, your RPE for that activity will decrease, a sign you can make your workout more challenging.
## Go Next Level with WHOOP
Using a proprietary algorithm inspired by the Borg Scale, WHOOP quantifies the strain your body takes on each day, and during your individual workouts. Every morning, our recovery metric tells you how prepared your body is to take on strain so you can avoid overtraining. And with the new Strain Target feature available with the WHOOP Strap 3.0, you’ll know in real time as you’re working out whether to push harder, if you’ve reached your strain goal, or when you’re overdoing it.",6/18/19

To his credit, Bob jumped into this journey with full commitment. First, he started riding a stationary bike daily for 45 minutes. His average day strain increased from 6.7 in February to 8.8 in October (see heat-map graphic below). Bob also got a better handle on his sleep. It gave him real peace of mind to track this and learn he was sleeping sufficiently and getting good quality sleep. Finally, he and his wife started eating specific foods for brain health (like blueberries, leafy greens and dark chocolate) and cut out processed bread and added sugar.

Additionally, Bob’s average daily WHOOP recovery has risen from 45% to 63%. He’s also down 20 pounds and quite a bit in body fat percentage, and he’s feeling much more like himself again.

brightening-holidays-combat-diabetes-alzheimers,How WHOOP is Brightening Our Holidays in 2020 and Beyond,"A WHOOP Membership & 20-Page Letter
For his birthday, I gave Bob a 6-month membership to WHOOP. He’s someone who enjoys numbers and is very much a logical thinker, but also does not love to be digitally connected. I figured he would appreciate the non-invasiveness of WHOOP. Along with the gift, I wrote Bob a 20-page letter. My message was two-fold:
One, memory loss and diabetes are not inevitable, and no one is powerless in the face of their progression. My goal was to communicate, in very clear terms, how simply he could get his health back on track. No fad diets, hiring a trainer or medication were necessary. In fact, all the anxiety and stress he was experiencing due to the pre-diabetes diagnosis and his “senior moments” could be tempered by following Dr. Isaacson’s 4 recommendations for chronic disease prevention and management:
Cardiovascular exercise
Improved sleep quality and duration
Better nutrition
“Knowing your numbers”
And two, our surroundings inform your behavioral biases. I detailed how, while many Americans, including his family, friends, co-workers and acquaintances, are largely detrained and sedentary, that was not how life “should” be. To make it really resonate, I specifically wrote about a few mutual friends with unaddressed (but preventable) health issues.
In short, I told Bob that he needed to break the negative intergenerational health cycle in his family and that WHOOP could help. With a daily objective and unobtrusive feedback loop on the exact behaviors he needed to change, he had a chance to really take control of his health, without overcomplicating it or stressing himself further.",12/9/20
brightening-holidays-combat-diabetes-alzheimers,How WHOOP is Brightening Our Holidays in 2020 and Beyond,"At Thanksgiving last year, in 2019, I found out that a very close family friend was pre-diabetic. I also already knew that he was struggling with some typical age-related memory impairments. Since my grandfather, the head of our family, had just passed away in the same year (having suffered from Alzeimer’s Dementia [AD] and diabetes as well), the thought of losing another person with whom I’d shared holidays and vacations growing up made me realize what was at stake.
I immediately resolved to do my best to help him avoid the same fate as my grandfather. To respect my friend’s privacy, I’ll refer to him as “Bob.”
My first thought was to do as much research as possible on chronic illness. As a wellness consultant and a personal trainer, I was already very much focused on how my clients spent the other 23 hours of their days, beyond just our exercise sessions. I learned how lifestyle choices, in combination with genetic factors, increased the risk of developing both metabolic disorders like diabetes and memory-related illnesses like AD.
I’d also recently gotten into WHOOP, and had caught a podcast with Dr. Richard Isaacson on Alzheimer’s. It touched on personal stories of close family members suffering from memory loss, and discussed the broader, widespread nature of the disease. After learning that a staggering 46 million Americans have Stage 1, pre-symptomatic AD, and that proper sleep and exercise can significantly hamstring its further progression, I was extremely motivated to communicate this to Bob.",12/9/20

brooke-wells-crossfit-open-workout-21-1,Brooke Wells Answers 6 Questions on 2021 CrossFit Season,"## Brooke Wells on Upcoming Season & CrossFit Open Workout 21.1
We asked WHOOP member Brooke Wells, the 5th-place finisher at last year’s CrossFit Games, six questions about the season ahead and the first Open workout, 21.1:
1. What are your feelings about starting the 2021 season? Are your emotions a source of fuel or something you try to quiet?
“I am so excited for the 2021 season!! Ive made some changes this year to make sure it’s my best year yet and take every possible step I can to reach my potential. It’s going to be good! I try not to base any training off emotions because emotions fade. I am very disciplined and determined.”
2. How have you prepared for the first Open workout?
“I don’t think anyone was too prepared for wall walks, haha. But I’ve been focusing on the bigger picture, as in the Semifinals and the Games and mostly training through the Open to do my best on those events, as well as enjoying the Open process with my gym fam and community.”
3. What were your immediate thoughts when seeing the programming for 21.1?
1 wall walk 10 double-unders 3 wall walks 30 double-unders 6 wall walks 60 double-unders 9 wall walks 90 double-unders 15 wall walks 150 double-unders 21 wall walks 210 double-unders
“I just laughed because Castro always has something up his sleeve, haha. But honestly, I knew right away it was going to be a very challenging workout on the shoulders!”
WHOOP member Brooke Wells does wall walks in CrossFit Open workout 21.1.
4. Can you give us some insight as to what goes through your head when you’re doing a workout like this?
“Honestly just focusing on maximizing being my best on the workout. It’s fun to do with the Fittest on Earth, Tia–but I also have to stay in my lane. I just take each movement and rep one at a time instead of getting overwhelmed with the entire workout.”

calculating-max-heart-rate,Understanding Max Heart Rate and Why It Matters for Training,"## WHAT DOES max heart rate MEAN?
Your max heart rate is the greatest number of beats per minute your heart can possibly reach during all-out strenuous exercise. Maximum heart rates vary from one person to another, and while they are not an indicator of physical fitness, knowing what your max HR is can be very useful when deciding what types of workouts or training you want to do.
Below we’ll explain how to figure out your max heart rate, what to do with it, plus answer some frequently asked questions about it.
## How to Calculate MaxImum Heart Rate
There are a number of formulas out there for calculating max heart rate. The easiest and most commonly used one is to simply subtract your age from 220. So if you’re 40 years old, your max heart rate would be 180 bpm. However, this method is flawed for a variety of reasons. It’s less accurate for both younger and older people, and also does not consider variables specific to you–most importantly genetics.
Other more detailed formulas for estimated maximum heart rate exist as well, like the Tanaka (208 – 0.7 x age) and the Gulati (206 – 0.88 x age, for females). While they may be more accurate for different ages, they also fail to take into account the fact that every human body is different and some people are just born with higher or lower max heart rates than others.
A better solution is to wear a device like WHOOP that tracks heart rate continuously and will determine exactly what your own personal max heart rate is.
## Why IS Max Heart Rate IMPORTANT?
Calculating max heart rate is necessary for heart rate training and understanding what your heart rate zones are. Once you know what your max HR is, you can then monitor your heart rate while exercising and track what percentage of your max you hit during certain workouts and activities.",5/26/22
calculating-max-heart-rate,Understanding Max Heart Rate and Why It Matters for Training,"Max Heart rate FAQs
### How long can you stay at your maximum heart rate?
How long can you stay at your maximum heart rate?
Since your max heart rate is attained by the most strenuous level of physical exertion your body is capable of, it is only sustainable for very short periods of time. For the average person, this likely falls somewhere between 10 seconds and 1 minute.
Very good athletes can often perform at their max HR for 2 minutes or so, while the world’s best may be able to for 3-4 minutes.
### Does max heart rate increase with fitness and is it good to have a high max heart rate?
Does max heart rate increase with fitness and is it good to have a high max heart rate?
No. Max heart rate in itself is not an indicator of fitness. It does not rise as your fitness improves or if you exercise regularly, nor is it a sign that you are more fit than someone else if you have a higher max HR than they do.
However, as discussed above, as your fitness level increases you will be able to maintain your max heart rate for longer periods of time.
### What factors affect max heart rate?
What factors affect max heart rate?
It’s primarily determined by genetics, and tends to decrease gradually with age.
### Is it possible to exceed your max heart rate?
Is it possible to exceed your max heart rate?
No, if you do it simply means you hadn’t previously recorded your true max HR.",5/26/22
calculating-max-heart-rate,Understanding Max Heart Rate and Why It Matters for Training,"What is Your Max Heart Rate? Find Out With WHOOP
When you first put on a WHOOP, we use a formula based on demographic information you provide to create an initial estimate of your max HR. From there, WHOOP monitors your heart rate 24/7 and adjusts accordingly based on your own HR data to reliably measure what your max heart rate is. Additionally, WHOOP offers you the option to manually input your max HR as well.
WHOOP also uses your heart rate data to quantify the strain your body takes on for individual activities and over the course of the entire day. Each morning, our recovery metric (calculated using heart rate variability, resting heart rate, respiratory rate and sleep) tells you how ready your body is to take on strain. Additionally, when you track your workouts with the WHOOP Strain Target, you’ll see in real time which percentage of max heart rate zone you’re in so that you can make most of your training.",5/26/22
calculating-max-heart-rate,Understanding Max Heart Rate and Why It Matters for Training,"Max Heart Rate and Exercise Intensity
Different percentages of your max HR represent various heart rate training zones, which are useful to target depending on what your goals are. For example, as you can see in the chart below, working out at 70-80% of your max heart rate is good for improving your overall level of aerobic fitness. Physical activity and exercise intensity at 60-70% of max HR is also beneficial to build endurance and lose weight, while exercise programs designed for active recovery should aim for 50-60%.

calorie-tracking-science,The Science of Calorie Tracking,"Where Calories Come From and Where They Go
Calories are a unit of energy. We get our energy from food and expend that energy in three ways: (1) staying alive (2) digesting food and (3) doing things.
### STAYING ALIVE (BASAL METABOLIC RATE)
The number of calories needed to maintain the basic functions of life – tasks like your heart beating, your eyes blinking, growing your hair and nails – is referred to as the “Basal Metabolic Rate,” or “BMR.” Your BMR depends in large part on your age and size. Women tend to have lower BMRs than men but this is mostly because they also tend to be smaller. Men and women of equivalent size and with equivalent lean muscle mass tend to have very similar BMRs. While you can increase your BMR by increasing your lean muscle mass, for the most part, this value is relatively consistent from month to month.
### DIGESTING FOOD (THERMIC EFFECT OF FOOD)
It turns out there is no such thing as a free lunch. If you want to digest your food, you will need to spend some calories in order to break it down into usable components. This physiological phenomenon is sometimes called the “Thermic Effect of Food” and collectively refers to the calories used to digest, absorb, and dispose of food. Some foods require more calories to process than others. For example, high fiber brown rice has a higher thermic effect than does its low fiber counterpart, white rice. Overall, about 10% of our total caloric intake is used to process food, but this varies significantly by diet, especially by the percent of protein in the diet. One study showed that 20-35% of the calories consumed as protein are used up digesting that protein.",11/11/19
calorie-tracking-science,The Science of Calorie Tracking,"So Where Does This Leave Us?
Regardless of what any calorie tracker is advertising, estimates of caloric consumption need to be understood to be just that, estimates. But, that doesn’t mean they aren’t useful. Heart-rate-based calorie estimates, like the ones provided by WHOOP, scale reliably with true caloric consumption, meaning that you can look at trends in caloric burn and trust that it’s accurately identifying relatively high and low calorie-burn periods. This reliability is key to its use, because it means that eating more or eating less on days when you burn more or fewer calories is still a reasonable way to action this data.
On the ingestion side, it is important to understand all the limitations on accurate calorie counting, even with the most diligent and intentional tracking practices:
Nutrition labels are estimates, not guarantees, and in fact are permitted to be up to 20% off and very rarely audited for compliance with this lax standard.
Calorie estimates from restaurants are statistically more likely to underestimate total caloric content than to overestimate them.
Caloric estimation guidelines for produce and whole foods are often decades old and may not reflect changes in nutritional profiles caused by industrial scale agriculture and modern farming practices.
The way we prepare food can alter its caloric density. For example, one study found that we derive more calories from cooked meat than we do from raw meat.
Difficult (if not impossible) to measure factors including the composition of your microbiome – that is the ecosystem of bacteria that live in your digestive tract – influence the proportion of food calories that actually get absorbed.
A more exhaustive review of all challenges with accurately counting calories can be found in a 2013 issue of Scientific American.
For all these reasons, WHOOP always recommends mindful eating – that is paying attention to portion sizes and checking in with yourself if you feel full.",11/11/19
calorie-tracking-science,The Science of Calorie Tracking,"Predicting Caloric Consumption
You probably already know that if you consume more calories than you expend you will gain mass (either muscle or fat), if you consume fewer calories than you expend you will lose mass, and if you match input to output your weight stays the same. Because of this seemingly simple relationship, lots of athletes are interested in tracking their daily caloric expenditure in order to manage their weight according to their goals.
What you might not know is how imprecise commercially available estimates of caloric intake and expenditure actually are. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that food labels are accurate within 20%, but studies have shown that food labels are more likely to underestimate caloric content than they are to overestimate it. Calorie estimates on menus were shown to be one of the worst offenders of caloric inaccuracy, as changes in ingredient availability and cooking style lead to inconsistency in the preparation of even common dishes. The FDA’s seemingly loose 20% error bounds are also actually necessary as whole foods have natural variation in their caloric density – everything from weather, soil quality, health of the plant, and ripeness contributes to how nutrient and calorically dense produce is. Therefore, not surprisingly, natural foods – like a salad – tend to differ from their advertised caloric contents by more than processed foods – like a candy bar – which tend to be truer to their nutrition labels.
What this all means is that, even if you weigh every gram of food that you put in your body, you couldn’t possibly count your caloric intake with smaller than a 20% error bound. Those 2000 calories you believe you consumed could easily have been 2400, an error bar approximately the size of a McDonald’s Double Cheeseburger.",11/11/19
calorie-tracking-science,The Science of Calorie Tracking,"Predicting Active Burn
Estimating the caloric expenditure of activity is far trickier business than is estimating BMR, and even less relevant third-party research has been done in this area. The most accurate way to calculate calories burnt during exercise is through a process called “indirect calorimetry” which measures gas exchange (oxygen and carbon dioxide). Since indirect calorimetry requires use of a device covering the nose and mouth, such a technology is not available in wrist-worn devices. Working within the limitations of a wrist-worn device, calorie estimates using HR have been shown to far out-perform those using acceleration (motion) alone.
The most commonly used heart-rate-based formula for estimating caloric consumption during activity, or so called “active calories,” was developed in South Africa in 2005. Despite being the best performing published algorithm of its kind, it has two primary issues – first it was fit only to exercise conducted at an intensity of 57%, 77% and 90% of Max HR and therefore untested above and below these intensities, and second it was found to explain only 73.4% of the variance in true energy expenditure. This means that a workout estimated to consume 1000 calories could have easily burnt 734 to 1266 calories – a massive difference if you are trying to use this information to modify your body composition. A 2017 study which did not include WHOOP confirmed this difficulty when it demonstrated that none of the commercially available wearables on the market at the time of the analysis could estimate workout calories within what the Stanford researchers had determined to be acceptable error.",11/11/19
calorie-tracking-science,The Science of Calorie Tracking,"Predicting Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)
Over 100 years ago, Arthur Harris and Francis Benedict came up with the “Harris-Benedict Equation” for predicting BMR from height, weight, age, and biological sex. While small changes to these formulas have been made in the century since, they still largely remain intact. However, their staying power should not be interpreted to be a sign of accuracy – the “Revised Harris-Benedict Equations,” which were developed in 1984 and are considered the most accurate BMR prediction using only height, weight, age, and biological sex, is still known to have only a 95% confidence level of ±213 kcal/day for men and ±201 kcal/day for women.
Using incorrect biometric data, like an out-of-date weight, can further add to the error between your BMR estimate and truth. So in order to maximize accuracy, it’s important to make sure data like your height and weight are up to date in your WHOOP app.
One common confusion is the difference between BMR and RMR (resting metabolic rate). BMR is, as mentioned above, the calories associated with maintaining the necessary functions of sustaining life (things like breathing) while RMR is used as an estimate of “ordinary” non-workout caloric consumption, and therefore includes all forms of “ordinary activity” (things like cooking breakfast). If you have ever used an online calculator that predicted your daily caloric needs and incorporated information like “How Active Are You” then that was an RMR calculator, not a BMR calculator. The practical difference is small, but in the WHOOP world, we use BMR and then account for things like the different caloric needs of someone with a desk job versus an Emergency Room nurse on their feet all day in our “Active Burn” calculation.",11/11/19
calorie-tracking-science,The Science of Calorie Tracking,Our active burn formula is inspired by the South African team’s methodologies and enhanced through our collection of millions of workouts worth of data across a wide spectrum of activities and intensities. In a recent update we modified our algorithm to better model the dynamics of the lowest-intensity exercises and to better integrate the active burn and BMR formulas by smoothing the transition between rest and exercise modes. This update primarily impacts periods of time in which your heart rate is between 30% and 40% of your heart rate reserve – the range from your resting heart rate (0%) to your max HR (100%) which is above resting/restful activities but below the level at which people typically exercise. This update has no impact on heart rates below 30% of your heart rate reserve and minimal impact on high-intensity exercise.,11/11/19
calorie-tracking-science,The Science of Calorie Tracking,"DOING THINGS (ACTIVE BURN)
Any level of activity beyond the basics of staying alive increases the rate of caloric consumption above the BMR. In general, the more you do, the more calories it takes to power that work. These calories are the ones you have the most control over and the primary reason why our caloric needs can vary so much from day to day. You can’t meaningfully change your BMR in a week, but add a 30-minute jog and you will increase your daily caloric consumption by anywhere from 250-550 calories.",11/11/19

Recently, we made an improvement to this algorithm, and are excited to share the science and research behind how we count calories as well as take the opportunity to look at the challenges and limitations with calorie counting so that you can best understand how you should be actioning this metric.",11/11/19
can-data-help-us-sleep-better,Can Data Help Us Sleep Better?,"I was recently honored with the opportunity to speak at the Sleep Technology Summit, a conference put on by the National Sleep Foundation exploring recent innovations and future projections in sleep technology.
While there, my conversations centered on two parallel themes, (1) can new technologies accurately measure sleep at a level worthy of displacing Polysomnography, the decades-old gold standard, and (2) why bother?
The first theme I was prepared for, we get asked this all the time and frankly, most of my job is working to enable us to truthfully answer “Yes.” However, given the audience of sleep professionals, the second major theme came as more of a surprise. Nonetheless, people were skeptical as to whether or not consumer sleep monitoring devices could offer their users value.

can-data-help-us-sleep-better,Can Data Help Us Sleep Better?,"Getting Personal
At the conference, it seemed like a wide-spread criticism of the wearable sleep-tech industry was that while vast amounts of data were being generated, the data doesn’t actually benefit the user. I think this is a fair criticism of first-generation sleep tech which generated “data” alone but is significantly different from what WHOOP is doing now generating “actionable data.” Data tells us that people on the western edges of their time zones go to bed later than people on the eastern edges, but it doesn’t tell you what to do if you’re a sleep-deprived western-edge dweller. WHOOP’s business model from day 1 was about personalized, actionable feedback born from the recognition that the elite athletes we target are who they are because they are outliers, and therefore are less likely than “the average person” to have “average” physiological responses.
For example, common lore is that it takes one day per time zone traveled to adjust to jetlag; a decent rule of thumb that doesn’t actually work for everyone and vastly oversimplifies the complex dynamics of our circadian rhythm. Before the Olympic trials, WHOOP identified Connor Jaeger as someone who took longer than he realized to adjust to time zone changes and recommended that he travel to Omaha ahead of his team. He did, and the rest is history; he not only qualified to compete in Rio that trip but went on to win an Olympic silver medal in the 1500 meter freestyle race.",9/29/16

In the summit’s opening event, I learned that the average person who reports an interest in improving sleep is in their 40s or 50s, presumably because that’s when a lifetime of bad sleep habits are catching up to them. Because of our focus on the relationship between sleep and athletic performance, WHOOP is positioned to educate a younger population on the importance of sleep. This means that we have the opportunity to improve behavior before health consequences emerge, something we hope translates to fewer sleep-related issues down the road.

can-data-help-us-sleep-better,Can Data Help Us Sleep Better?,"Navigating a “Medical” Problem with a Non-Medical Device
In one of my first conversations, the following question was posed: “As a non-FDA approved device, federal regulations prevent you from diagnosing sleep disorders. If you can’t do that, what good do you provide?”
As is tradition, I began my answer with “Great Question,” but the truth is, it was surprisingly parochial. There is tremendous room for non-medical sleep tech in healthcare that is fully kosher with the FDA as a case-finding and conversation-prompting tool. For example, imagine a doctor-patient conversation in which the patient expresses the following frustration: “I’m tired all the time, but get 8 hours of sleep per night.” As we reported earlier in a white paper examining the value of sleep stage tracking, 8 hours in bed usually only means about 7 hours of sleep, but the person-to-person variability in actual sleep efficiency is huge (standard deviation = 7.2%). This is important because people usually don’t know where they fall on this distribution, so two patients both honestly reporting that they believe they are getting 8 hours could actually be getting extremely different amounts of sleep. Furthermore, two people both getting similar amounts of total sleep could be losing sleep to different culprits – some people have trouble falling asleep while others have trouble staying asleep. But if our doctors knew more about how much sleep we were getting and where we were losing sleep, better-informed doctor/patient conversations could follow.",9/29/16
can-data-help-us-sleep-better,Can Data Help Us Sleep Better?,"Just One More Hour
In a retrospective analysis conducted this spring, we found that athletes who joined WHOOP averaging fewer than 7.9 hours of sleep per night added 52 minutes in bed per night by their 129th day on the platform. Previous research has shown that adding an additional hour of sleep per night positively alters gene expression for over 500 genes, including genes implicated in diabetes, cancer, inflammation, and stress. Another study linked an hour of additional sleep to a reduction in blood pressure in the hypertensive.

cardio-vs-strength-training,The Benefits of Cardio vs. Strength Training,"Exercise has an undeniable positive effect on overall health. Physical activity reduces the likelihood of developing chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, dementia and many different types of cancer. Regular fitness also boosts longevity. The CDC reports that increased physical activity could prevent 110,000 deaths in U.S. adults 40 years and up. As little as 10 minutes a day could make a big difference.
Cardiovascular exercise benefits your body by raising your pulse and breathing rate, and by increasing oxygen consumption, which over time improves heart and lung function. Cardio workouts, which include running, swimming, cycling, hiking, skiing, and dance, among many other options, also burn calories, helping keep your weight within a healthy range.
Strength training, on the other hand, employs a form of resistance, such as weights, body weight, and/or resistance bands, to build muscle, strength, and endurance. Strength training can also help increase bone density, burn calories, and increase metabolism.
These two forms of exercise work different systems of the body and each lead to extensive benefits, so incorporating both into your routine helps you unlock peak performance and maximize health benefits. According to research published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, cardio and strength training are most effective in reducing mortality risk when performed together.
Here’s a more in-depth look into the benefits of cardio and strength training individually, and tips for designing an effective workout routine that makes the most of both types of exercise:",5/8/23
cardio-vs-strength-training,The Benefits of Cardio vs. Strength Training,"Benefits of Cardiovascular Exercise
The benefits of regular cardio exercise are both immediate and long-term, and serve your body in numerous, unparalleled ways. From improving heart health and endurance, to promoting better sleep and helping manage chronic conditions, the impact of routine cardio workouts cannot be overstated. Here are some of the many ways you benefit:
### Promote Cardiovascular Health
Cardio fitness is one of the most commonly recommended strategies for improving cardiovascular health. It can optimize blood pressure and heart rate by boosting blood circulation, and by strengthening the heart muscle. Cardio exercise also supports ideal cardiac output and function.
### Improve Sleep
Regular cardio exercise can have a multi-pronged impact on improving sleep. Research indicates that moderate cardio exercise was linked with greater sleep quality and restfulness, as well as fewer nighttime awakenings and a reduction in the time it took to fall asleep.
### Help Manage Chronic Health Conditions
Cardiovascular exercise has a positive impact on more than just the cardiovascular system. Regular cardio has been linked to benefits for several other chronic health conditions.
For those dealing with diabetes, cardio may also decrease blood sugar levels and assist with insulin level management. It can also benefit those with asthma and chronic pain by decreasing the chance of asthma attacks and reducing pain levels.",5/8/23
cardio-vs-strength-training,The Benefits of Cardio vs. Strength Training,"Tips on Optimizing Your Fitness Routine
Cardio and strength training have the most significant impact on health when performed together as part of a balanced fitness routine. Here are some tips for programming an optimal exercise routine:
Follow Science-Based Recommendations — The same study that found that cardio and strength training was most effective in lowering mortality risk when performed together also highlighted guidelines for how often each type of exercise could be done to see results. A minimum of 1 hour of cardio and 1-2 strength training sessions per week effectively lowered mortality rate, though effects were more substantial with 3 hours of cardio a week.
Consider Your Goals — When deciding where to devote the bulk of your fitness efforts, it’s essential to consider your workout goals. If building muscle mass and strength is your main goal, you should spend more time on strength training while still performing some cardio. If boosting endurance and improving heart health are your main objectives, you should put more weight on cardio than strength training.
## Track Your Workouts with WHOOP
To truly optimize your fitness routine, you need to be able to measure the impact of your fitness efforts, whether they are cardiovascular or muscular. With WHOOP, you can quantify the demand that both cardio and strength training workouts put on you. When you use Strength Trainer, your Strain score calculates the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular load of you workout to understand the demands you are putting on your body.
Strength Trainer makes WHOOP the first wearable to comprehensively measure the impact of strength training workouts on your body. As you look to develop an optimal routine based on your fitness goals, Strength Trainer can help you adjust your routine accordingly.",5/8/23
cardio-vs-strength-training,The Benefits of Cardio vs. Strength Training,"Benefits of Strength Training
While strength training can feel even more physically taxing, the pay-off is enormous, and has positive effects on body composition, blood profiles, cognitive function, mental health, and even hormonal balance, which are explained in more depth in our related WHOOP podcast by our team of experts. Overall, strength training exercises lead to measurable, life-enhancing health benefits including:
### Increase Muscle Mass
Strength training increases muscle mass by stimulating muscle fibers, which can lead to greater muscle growth over time. It can also be a vital strategy for combating age-related changes in muscle. Muscle mass naturally decreases by around 5% each decade after age 30, but strength training can work against this decline.
### Benefit Bone Health
Bone mass starts to decrease by around 1% each year after age 40, increasing bone fragility. Research suggests that strength training can be useful for remedying this age-related change by reducing the rate of bone loss and by helping promote increases in bone mass.
### Reduce Stress Levels
Resistance and strength training has been linked to reductions in stress levels. According to research, regular strength training is associated with lower feelings of worry and anxiety. It’s also been shown to positively affect cognitive function, self-esteem, and depression. These results have been consistent with different types of strength training exercises and study participants.
### Strengthen the Joints
The benefits of strength training are not limited to increases in muscle strength — this type of exercise can also strengthen your joints. Strength training promotes overall joint health and can also address acute joint issues. Research has found that strength training can reduce joint pain, ease stiffness, and support optimal movement in those dealing with osteoarthritis of the knees and hips.",5/8/23

Cardio exercise also improves cognitive function, memory, and brain health. Cardio exercise has been found to improve the blood flow rate to the brain, carrying vital oxygen and glucose that boosts performance.
A study from the University of British Columbia found that cardio exercise was linked to improvements in spatial memory abilities and increases in an area of the brain called the hippocampus, which plays a significant role in learning and memory. It’s posited that cardio fitness may help combat the memory decline associated with aging and dementia.

case-studies-respiratory-rate-covid-19,Knowing Your Baseline: Case Studies in Respiratory Rate in Time of COVID-19,"The Science Behind Respiratory Rate and COVID-19
WHOOP measures respiratory rate during sleep using a phenomenon called Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia. The simple explanation is that when you breathe in your heart rate increases, and when you breathe out it decreases. Typically people average between 12 and 20 respirations per minute (RPM).
What stands out about respiratory rate compared to other metrics WHOOP tracks is that it’s remarkably consistent and rarely changes much from night to night. However, when it does change significantly, it is usually for a meaningful reason.
And while WHOOP is not a medical device, it is the first wrist-worn wearable to have the accuracy of its respiratory rate third-party validated.
When the pandemic initially began to take hold, we gave our members the ability to track COVID-19 in the app via the WHOOP Journal. We hoped to learn more about the disease from those who were eager to share their data. One of the first things that came to our attention was a frequent increase in respiratory rate prior to COVID-19 symptoms.
Our Vice President of Data Science & Research Emily Capodilupo detailed the science behind it on Episode 67 of our podcast, Respiratory Rate and COVID-19:
“COVID-19 is a lower respiratory tract infection. The infected cells are the alveoli, the point of contact in your lungs to your blood. As they get damaged, your ability to get oxygen into the blood and get carbon dioxide out becomes less efficient. In order to compensate, you have to take more breaths.”
As a result of what we discovered, we fast-tracked an upgrade to the WHOOP app that made it easier for members to monitor trends in their respiratory rates. A short time later, we also updated our recovery metric (a measure of how ready your body is to perform each day) to factor in changes in respiratory rate.

As you can see in the instances above, there is value in tracking your respiratory rate on a daily basis and being well aware of what your baseline metrics are. In fact, one WHOOP member who recently noticed substantial abnormalities in his data thought he might have contracted COVID-19, but after seeking medical attention was alerted to the fact that he’d actually had a heart attack. “Understanding my WHOOP data helped save my life,” he told us.
In the current state of the world, 24/7 knowledge of your physiological data is a very powerful thing.
With the pandemic ongoing and cold and flu season on the way, it becomes of even greater importance. It’s also worth noting that unlike COVID-19 (which is a lower respiratory tract infection) the flu and seasonal allergies generally impact tissues in your upper respiratory tract and do not cause major fluctuation in respiratory rate.
As we continue to learn more about the impact COVID-19 has on WHOOP data, we’re working hard to make our findings as beneficial to our members as we can. We’ve submitted research for peer review and publication on the utility of wearable technology in providing early warning signs of potential COVID-19 infections. While experts in the field evaluate the study, a complete preprint of the article can be found online.
UPDATE: Our paper Analyzing Changes in Respiratory Rate to Predict the Risk of COVID-19 Infection has been peer reviewed and published in the journal PLOS ONE.

After word of Nick Watney’s story broke, in an effort to further protect the health and well-being of everyone on the Tour the PGA quickly moved to procure 1,000 WHOOP Straps for any players, caddies, or other essential personnel who wanted one. By the following weekend, WHOOP was widely used across the PGA Tour.
Before the Tour de France, EF Pro Cycling made the decision to outfit all of its riders and staff with WHOOP to monitor their physiological data and support a return to competition on a public stage. Similarly, the University of Tennessee chose to provide WHOOP to all of its student athletes prior to taking the field again in the fall.
This line of thinking soon caught on outside of the sporting world as well. Other businesses and organizations, like Tory Burch for example, turned to WHOOP to help give their employees more insight into their well-being on a daily basis.",10/26/20
case-studies-respiratory-rate-covid-19,Knowing Your Baseline: Case Studies in Respiratory Rate in Time of COVID-19,"On the morning of Friday June 19th, 2020, pro golfer Nick Watney woke up preparing to play in the second round of the PGA Tour’s RBC Heritage tournament in Hilton Head, South Carolina. He’d felt a bit “sluggish” the day before, but thought it was just because he’d been up so early–3:50 am for a 6:56 am tee time to start the tournament.
As part of the Tour’s standard protocol, Nick had tested negative for COVID-19 upon arriving in South Carolina three days earlier. He felt fine when he got out of bed, and had no noticeable symptoms of any kind.
“I checked the [WHOOP] data and my respiratory rate had gone up. I’m usually in the low 14s [and it had gone up] to the low 18s,” Nick told us on the WHOOP Podcast. “I took a screenshot of it (see below) and sent it to my wife and said ‘This is very alarming,’ just because I had read when [WHOOP] had analyzed data from users that had come down with COVID. It was something that jumped out. Raised respiratory rate seems like a pretty consistent tell-tale sign.”
Nick immediately contacted PGA officials, got tested again, and withdrew from the tournament before his round that day when the results came back positive. He was the first PGA player to test positive for COVID-19, and without a keen knowledge of his baseline WHOOP data, Nick likely would have remained in the tournament and put numerous other people at risk.",10/26/20
case-studies-respiratory-rate-covid-19,Knowing Your Baseline: Case Studies in Respiratory Rate in Time of COVID-19,"Data Stories from WHOOP Members
As the pandemic winds on, more and more stories from the field have poured into our channels. Our members are constantly reaching out to us in the hopes that sharing their data may benefit others. Here are just a few of those examples.
Ashley Dwyer is a 31-year-old pharmacist and health coach in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. After learning she’d been exposed to COVID-19, she got a rapid test that came back negative. Three days later she observed her respiratory rate jump by two breaths per minute above her normal baseline:
“I immediately called out of work and went to get retested, PCR this time. I was positive,” Ashley told us. “If I hadn’t had my WHOOP, I likely would have continued working that weekend in the pharmacy exposing others.”
Matthew Cosgrove, 23, is a grocery store manager in Dublin, Ireland, which recently became the first European country to return to lockdown. Last month Matthew went on vacation and visited his parents. A day after learning his mother had come in close contact with someone who’d tested positive, Mathew noticed a spike of 3.2 RPM in his respiratory rate and also awoke with a recovery of 1%:
His parents first resisted his urging that they all needed to be tested, but were persuaded when he explained to them his understanding of his WHOOP data. All three tested positive, and Matthew told us that despite feeling a bit “tired and achy” that day, he had no other symptoms.
And finally, the screenshots below are from an anonymous NFL player who tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday, June 23, 2020. In addition to a dramatic leap in his respiratory rate, his heart rate variability dropped significantly and his resting heart rate rose well above his baseline:
Even with a professional athlete whose numbers quickly returned to normal, there was still the meaningful uptick in respiratory rate we see so often.",10/26/20
case-study-st-pauls-school,A Case Study at St. Paul’s: The Ability of WHOOP to Transform High School Sleep Habits,"Case Study at St. Paul’s
St. Paul’s was the perfect location to launch a study–and I’m not saying that just because I’m a proud alum. The boarding school provided a unique, controlled environment for our investigation. Based on a 2,000-acre campus in New Hampshire, St. Paul’s is by its nature inherently secluded. Unlike some independent schools, all of St. Paul’s students are boarding students and there are no parents on campus. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic helped standardize the student experience even further. While students were still able to participate in athletics, they were required to stay on campus during the school year.
Despite the ideal conditions, I was also hesitant. Although I had a very positive experience at St. Paul’s, I know that parents are often reluctant to send their kids to boarding schools in part because they are afraid their children will never go to bed or develop unhealthy lifestyles. Conventional wisdom says that an environment without parents would make it even less likely that a high school student achieves their sleep goals. Could WHOOP effectively encourage kids to sleep more even in the absence of their parents’ direct oversight? We sought to answer that question.
In January, we donated WHOOP straps to all students, faculty, and staff members at St. Paul’s. We had no conditions, and we didn’t provide any guidance to participants or encourage them to change or modify their behavior. While individuals’ data was completely private, we offered students the opportunity to share their data through WHOOP Teams.
In all, 375 students granted us access to their WHOOP metrics, and the results were astounding.",8/24/21
case-study-st-pauls-school,A Case Study at St. Paul’s: The Ability of WHOOP to Transform High School Sleep Habits,"What We Learned
By the end of four months, each student on average slept an hour more. Over the course of the semester, every month, their sleep improved: Initially 6:32 in January, then 7:11 in February, 7:23 in March, and finally 7:41 in April. Perhaps most importantly, the time students spent in REM and deep sleep both increased significantly.
While wearing WHOOP, students’ sleep quickly increased significantly.
In a sign of how powerful these changes were, the students’ “red recovery days”–a WHOOP metric that signals a body is stressed or fatigued and in need of recovery–decreased by 64 percent on average.
It’s not surprising that students’ increase in sleep was also accompanied by a 16 percent increase in their average heart rate variability, an indicator of the body’s ability to adapt to physical, mental, and emotional stress. Their average resting heart rate also dropped by three percent, from 58 beats per minute to 56 bpm by April.
Heart rate variability helps determine how ready someone’s body is to perform. As the St. Paul’s students used WHOOP, their HRV increased, highlighting an enhanced ability to respond to various stressors.
Additionally, students’ strain during the day increased by 13 percent on average as WHOOP coaching combined with their increased sleep enabled them to perform at a higher level while awake.
After four months, the students experienced significant improvements in their ability to recover and perform.
St. Paul’s goes to great lengths to make sure its students have the tools they need to properly recover. But it’s worth noting that during this study, neither WHOOP nor the school provided students with any interventions like blackout curtains or altered diets to influence their sleep habits. Since they attended a boarding school, the students also didn’t have their parents providing direct oversight of their sleep schedule. They simply wore WHOOP, monitored their own data, and experienced improvements across the board.",8/24/21
case-study-st-pauls-school,A Case Study at St. Paul’s: The Ability of WHOOP to Transform High School Sleep Habits,"Teenage years can be stressful enough, even when high schoolers get a full night’s sleep. I am glad that WHOOP could help a cohort of students at my old stomping grounds, and we’re focused on expanding our reach to even more young people, especially as they prepare for another school year to begin soon.

case-study-st-pauls-school,A Case Study at St. Paul’s: The Ability of WHOOP to Transform High School Sleep Habits,"One of the best parts about being the CEO of WHOOP is hearing how our platform helps our members. Increasingly, I’ve received emails and notes from parents of some of our younger WHOOP members telling me that WHOOP has transformed their children’s sleep habits, enhancing their performance in the classroom and during their extracurricular pursuits.
It comes as no surprise that high school students are in desperate need of sleep. While the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends that teenagers get 10 to 12 hours of sleep per night, a CDC report found that about two-thirds of American high school students reported sleeping less than 8 hours per night on school nights, even though sleep is crucial at this stage of development. Teenagers that fail to get enough sleep are at a higher risk of diabetes, obesity, and problems with attention. Stanford Medical School has labeled teenagers’ sleep deprivation an epidemic.
The notes I received from WHOOP parents piqued my curiosity. I wanted to investigate how much of a difference WHOOP could make in high school students’ lives. I decided to contact my own alma mater, St. Paul’s in Concord, NH, to see if the school might be interested in partnering for a case study.",8/24/21
cbd-affects-sleep-heart-rate-hrv,Does Taking CBD Actually Improve Your Sleep?,"How CBD Affects Sleep, Resting Heart Rate, HRV & Recovery
The changes are minor, but the data shows WHOOP members have better sleep efficiency and sleep consistency when they report using CBD. Additionally, their average sleep performance (the percentage of sleep they get compared to their sleep need) increases from 82% to 84% after logging CBD use.
WE FOUND CBD USE to have modest benefits on several SLEEP metrics, as well as RESTING HEART RATE & HRV.
CBD also has a slight positive effect on WHOOP members’ resting heart rate and heart rate variability, with average HRV rising by 1.3 milliseconds and average RHR dropping by 1 beat per minute. And while the difference is negligible, next-day recovery is 0.22% higher on average.
## See What Else Impacts Your WHOOP Data
The WHOOP Journal offers a great variety of options for things you can track, ranging from eating a late meal before bed, to feeling stressed during the day. You can then learn how these choices and behaviors affect your daily recovery and other WHOOP data from your Monthly Performance Assessments and in-app insights.",4/21/22
cbd-affects-sleep-heart-rate-hrv,Does Taking CBD Actually Improve Your Sleep?,"Use of CBD is one of many choices and behaviors you can track via the WHOOP Journal in order to better understand what impacts your physiological data. An analysis of journal responses from our members found that taking CBD leads to mild improvements in multiple sleep metrics.
## What is CBD?
CBD is an abbreviation for cannabidiol, which is a naturally occurring chemical compound. It comes from the Cannabid sativa plant, more commonly known as marijuana. CBD does not contain tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana that makes you “high.”
Common uses for CBD include pain relief, to curb anxiety or feel more calm and relaxed, and to help with sleep.",4/21/22
cbd-affects-sleep-heart-rate-hrv,Does Taking CBD Actually Improve Your Sleep?,"When and How Often Do WHOOP Members Track Using CBD?
For this analysis we looked at the anonymized data of WHOOP members who log using CBD on a regular basis (10 or more journal entries over the past 90 days).
We learned that 10.1% of female members actively track CBD, and 8.5% of male members.
We learned that 10.1% of female members actively track CBD, and 8.5% of male members.
In addition to it being more common with female members, we also found it to be more popular among older members. Of the roughly 9% of members who track CBD, there’s a 28.5% chance they will answer “yes” in the journal to using it on any given day. However, the average frequency of “yes” responses increases significantly with age:
20-29: 23.5% 30-39: 27.7% 40-49: 32.2% 50-59: 33.8%
20-29: 23.5% 30-39: 27.7% 40-49: 32.2% 50-59: 33.8%
20-29: 23.5% 30-39: 27.7% 40-49: 32.2% 50-59: 33.8%
20-29: 23.5% 30-39: 27.7% 40-49: 32.2% 50-59: 33.8%
For example, 20-29 year olds who track CBD on average use it about once or twice per week, while 50-59 year olds use it closer to 2-3 times a week.
As with marijuana, April is the most common month for CBD use, with members who track it logging it on 31.8% of all days.
However, unlike marijuana, which we saw has the highest usage rates on the weekends (implying recreationally), our members are most likely to use CBD during the week (on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays in that order), suggesting its intention is to aid performance, recovery, sleep, etc. That brings us back to the main question, does CBD actually help your sleep?

23:23 – The Impact of Alcohol. In Episode 42, Kristen and Emily detailed alcohol’s effect on sleep, recovery, and performance.
“Alcohol is a sedative, it’s not actually a sleeping aid. Sleep is an incredibly active process, our bodies are working really, really hard when we sleep, and if you have alcohol in your system, none of those very active processes can happen.”

“In most pandemics, about 40% of the population gets infected … so if we say 40% of Americans get infected, that is 120 million Americans or something. Let’s say on the conservative side that 0.3% of Americans die from that … that’s 360,000 deaths. That’s a top-3 killer in our society. It’s catastrophic, that many deaths. And it could be worse, maybe 60% of Americans get infected and maybe the case fatality rate is higher. It could be better. We don’t know and this is one of the frustrating things to try to communicate to the public that we cannot know for sure what is likely to happen. There’s a range of outcomes. What I can tell you is we need to take this seriously. This is not a drill.”

It’s about focusing on things outside of our immediate sphere of experience. … It makes sense why Mother Nature would design a chemical like this because otherwise why would we ever go forage for the food that would give us the reward?

“To me, stillness is when things slow down, when you get into a zone, when things are clear, when you’re not distracted by external or internal things. It’s the ability to concentrate, the ability to focus, the ability to be at peace with oneself. Stillness comes in a lot of forms. I think we can more clearly define it by what it’s not: It’s not inactivity, but it’s also not needless activity. This idea of stillness and this idea of being ego-free, I don’t think it’s antithetical to achievement, to success, or to great feats of prowess. … I actually think it’s more impressive to be successful and good and something and not a slave to it.”

ceo-7-features-i-love-in-whoop-4-0,WHOOP CEO: 7 Features I Love in WHOOP 4.0,"Earlier today at WHOOP Unlocked, our first-ever community event, we unveiled the next generation of WHOOP technology: WHOOP 4.0.
I have been thinking about this technology and building it for a decade and I can promise you that WHOOP 4.0 is the most advanced technology that we have ever released. I want to specifically highlight the seven features that I believe will transform your WHOOP experience.
## 1. Smaller Sensor, Compact Design
We heard from many members, particularly those with smaller wrists, that they wanted a WHOOP 4.0 that is less intrusive and more efficient. The WHOOP 4.0 is now 33 percent smaller. And it achieves this while bolstering new sensing and maintaining a five-day battery life. In fact, the WHOOP 4.0 sensor is the most advanced we’ve ever released with five LEDs, including green, red, and infrared light-emitting diodes for enhanced accuracy.
We know that WHOOP members love customizing their WHOOP. When we developed the 4.0, we wanted to create a system to easily change bands and unlock new color combinations and styles. Our solution is the Fast Link Slider. With the Fast Link, it’s never been easier to switch out the band. You’ll never need to thread your band again to wear a new color combination.
## 2. An Upgraded, Waterproof Battery Pack
We’ve completely elevated the battery pack that comes included with the WHOOP 4.0.
I know I’m not the only one who has previously ruined a battery pack in the shower. Good news: Battery Pack 4.0 is waterproof!
Battery Pack 4.0 slides on to your WHOOP and utilizes wireless charging, the first of its kind in a wearable, so there’s no need to take off your WHOOP 4.0.",9/12/21
ceo-7-features-i-love-in-whoop-4-0,WHOOP CEO: 7 Features I Love in WHOOP 4.0,"4. Sleep Planner
The WHOOP 4.0 is built with a new haptic technology, which allows Sleep Planner to wake you up through silent vibrations. It makes waking up more refreshing–and it allows you to wake up without disturbing your partner.
Sleep Planner now gives you three unique modes to allow you to perfectly customize your sleep:
Exact time – You can set a specific time for WHOOP to vibrate and wake you up.
Exact time – You can set a specific time for WHOOP to vibrate and wake you up.
Sleep goal – In this mode, Sleep Planner wakes you up when you reach a desired sleep performance score. If you want to reach 100 percent of a recommended sleep goal, Sleep Planner will tell you when you need to be in bed, will sense when you fall asleep, and will make sure you wake up when you’ve reached your target goal. It’s that easy.

The new Health Monitor may be the most important feature we’ve ever released.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we witnessed firsthand how WHOOP members used key WHOOP metrics, like respiratory rate, to monitor potential indicators of COVID-19. In our new release, we knew we wanted to put these metrics front and center. Through Health Monitor, members will have access to a dashboard with metrics including HRV, respiratory rate, and resting heart rate. Thanks to the WHOOP 4.0’s upgraded sensor suite, members will also see their skin temperature and blood oxygen levels. When your daily readings slide out of your target range, Health Monitor will alert you. This is just one way we help you understand the secrets your body is trying to tell you.
As part of Health Monitor, you’ll also be able share all of your data electronically. Right from the app, you can text or email a pdf of your 30-day and 180-day health reports immediately to your doctor, trainer, or loved one.",9/12/21

One of the most compelling features of WHOOP 4.0 is its versatility. For the first time-ever, we’ve created a new collection of apparel, WHOOP Body. WHOOP Body uses our new Any-Wear technology, which allows WHOOP 4.0 to be worn throughout the body.
We have two lines of apparel that we’ve just released:
The Training Collection, featuring sports bras, compression tops, leggings, shorts, and athletic boxers
The Intimates Collection which includes bralettes and everyday boxers
In all of these garments, the WHOOP sensor slides into a discrete pod that holds the sensor close to your skin and enables the WHOOP platform to seamlessly capture your data.
I’ve always said that wearable technology should be either cool or invisible. The WHOOP 4.0 has achieved both.
## 6. WHOOP Pro
In line with our commitment to empowering our members to more easily accessorize their WHOOP experience, we’re also releasing another membership experience: WHOOP Pro. This is designed for our members who love to accessorize their WHOOP.
Members can join WHOOP Pro for just $12 a month to receive:

I want to thank you all for being WHOOP members. I started WHOOP in a dorm room as a college kid. For many years building WHOOP was hard, lonely, and even painful. In the early days we didn’t know if what we wanted to build was even possible. What always pulled me through were the encouraging stories from WHOOP members and a deep sense that the technology we were building really mattered.
I now see WHOOP almost everywhere I go. I’ve met WHOOP members around the world. You send me stories about your data and your lifestyle transformations. We even commiserate together over missing our Sleep Need! Many of you have said that WHOOP changed your life. That motivates me.
Last week, I told the WHOOP team that this new injection of capital requires both a heavy dose of humility and the same sense of urgency and tenacity that got us here. We will face off head-to-head with the largest and most valuable technology companies in the world–some of which have no qualms copying us very directly. We will engage in highly ambitious research and development and release products for you on the cutting edge of health monitoring.
We are grateful for the opportunity to take on these new challenges. I ask that you keep sharing your stories with us and holding us accountable to our shared mission: To unlock human performance.
Thank you, Will Ahmed",8/30/21

This is just the beginning. We’re planning to grow to over 1,000 by the end of 2022. If you’re reading this and thinking WHOOP might be the right place to grow your career, please check out our Careers page.
## Expanding Internationally
WHOOP will become more accessible around the world and expand in countries throughout Europe, Asia, and beyond. We know that there are many of you around the world who are interested in joining the WHOOP community but haven’t been able to yet. We’re going to change that.",8/30/21
chargers-pro-bowler-darrell-stuckey-talks-whoop,Chargers' Pro-Bowler Darrell Stuckey Talks WHOOP,"“The first time I was on the field for a kickoff was 9/11 [in 2011] against the Vikings, and Percy Harvin took it to the house for a touchdown. I thought ‘Oh Lord, I don’t know if this is going to work out for me.’ But on the next kick, a punt, I beat the double team, laid out and made the tackle. I ended up getting Special Teams Player of the Day that game. It just goes to show you that at the end of the day you might make mistakes, but if you learn from them, you use them as a foundation to stand upon and keep breathing, keep grinding, keep digging, keep going forward.”
What prompted you to get WHOOP?
“I first started using WHOOP last October after one of my close friends, a Yankees Double-A baseball player, told me about how his organization used it that summer. He said ‘Have you ever heard of WHOOP?’ and I was like ‘WHOOP? What the heck is WHOOP?’ But it stuck in my head cause it was catchy. He kept saying ‘This thing is awesome. And it’s waterproof.’ I’d broken two Fitbits already just from sweat. Then my wife and my agent researched WHOOP and she got it for me as a surprise.”
How does WHOOP help with your workout regimen?
“The way in which you strain your body plays a big part in your recovery. WHOOP gives you tips and reminders on how your strain in back-to-back-to-back days affects your ability to recover. For example, today I did striders (I call them striders–100 yards, you’re opening up to ‘stride’ but you’re not going top speed, you do about 10 of them at 80%) since I’m kind of recovering from surgery still. My heart rate was up to 200. It looked like I was just coasting, but my heart was working hard because I hadn’t run in a while. In season my HRV was around 119-120. After surgery, 75 or 80.”",4/26/17
chargers-pro-bowler-darrell-stuckey-talks-whoop,Chargers' Pro-Bowler Darrell Stuckey Talks WHOOP,"“I think the biggest thing about the WHOOP is that it charges on your wrist. It benefits you so much more that you never have to take it off. It’s very convenient and it’s so it’s lightweight that you forget it’s even there. I taped over it and wore it in games a few times last season. The bicep band is also huge for putting it in a place that’s not vulnerable to be broken or hit. And I really like the options of bands. I’ll take off the one I exercise with sometimes and put on a nylon one or a Hydroband. I switch them out on the weekends so I’m not always wearing the one I sweat in.”
Finally, how do you feel about the Chargers moving to LA?
“I’ve been a Charger for eight years, and I still am a Charger. I’m glad it’s only an hour-and-a-half away from where our fans are so we’ll still have an opportunity to see those fans. I think it’s a journey that’s good for the team. Sometimes when a team has been in a rut for so long, it’s good to change the scenery. It’s definitely a lot better than being on a different team in a different city. Moving forward, we’re doing really well right now. The environment is a great one for us to succeed in and we’re all excited to see the new facility. I think it’s a good thing for us and the organization.”",4/26/17
chargers-pro-bowler-darrell-stuckey-talks-whoop,Chargers' Pro-Bowler Darrell Stuckey Talks WHOOP,"On Monday, WHOOP announced its partnership with the NFL Players Association to make the WHOOP Strap 2.0 the Officially Licensed Recovery Wearable of the NFLPA. Last year, Darrell Stuckey, a Pro-Bowler and five-time special teams captain with the Chargers, became one of the first NFL players to wear WHOOP. Stuckey shared his thoughts with us regarding the highlights of his career so far, his club moving from San Diego to Los Angeles, his training and recovery from offseason knee surgery, and what he thinks WHOOP can do for players across the league.
What do you remember about your first day in the NFL?
“I remember my first day of practice. Just being in the same room with players like Quentin Jammer, Eric Weddle, Antonio Gates, Philip Rivers, Shawne Merriman, it was surreal. Getting on the field and being across the ball from Gates, spending my first year guarding him in practice was amazing. And watching Darren Sproles, a guy who was from Kansas City like me, someone I’d seen break records in high school, was unbelievable. You’re at the highest level of a sport that you love, and when you get there the guys you grew up watching are still there, right in front of you. It’s just like–wow.”
What is the highlight of your career to this point?
“My second year in the NFL I got an opportunity to play on special teams. We were playing Green Bay, who was undefeated at the time. We almost beat them after being way behind. We kicked an onside kick to try to come back, and I recovered it. Then we drove and scored a touchdown. On the next kickoff I tackled the returner at the three-yard line. They went three and out, and we had a chance to win. That was my first big memorable moment early on in my career.”
And the lowlight?",4/26/17
chargers-pro-bowler-darrell-stuckey-talks-whoop,Chargers' Pro-Bowler Darrell Stuckey Talks WHOOP,"“My teammates and I can all do the same exact workout, but our strain levels would be different. What my body takes on as strain can be different from somebody else’s based on how our cardiovascular systems work. I could come in first every time if we ran, but my strain could be lower than someone who came in last.”
What do you do to sleep better?
“I have issues with sleeping and WHOOP helps me a lot. I’m competitive enough to know that when [my sleep troubles] affect my recovery I’m going to force myself to sleep more, to sleep better. As athletes, we’re competitive while we’re awake all day every day, but we’re not competitive while we sleep because we don’t see our sleep performance [until now].”
“I have trouble winding down. I’ve learned that if I stretch before I go to sleep–yoga stretches with deep breaths, stretches to cool down and get my body relaxed–I sleep a lot better. My body is groomed to go to bed and the next morning I don’t feel sore. I have better recovery days when I do that then when I just go right to bed when I’m dead tired, even if I don’t sleep as many hours.”
When did you have your worst WHOOP Recovery?
“It was February 11, when our third child was born. Our other two kids were sick throwing up all week and I hardly got any sleep. My wife’s water broke at 4 am and we barely made it to the hospital in time. Then I slept in the fold-out chair next to her hospital bed. My recovery after that was less than 10%.”
What do you like best about WHOOP?
“Everything, it’s collective. People don’t emphasize the necessity of recovery enough. We want to peak our performance and we want to be ready to go, but we don’t concentrate enough on recovery. And when we do, it’s not tangible to us. That’s what sets WHOOP apart. Most wearables out there you can’t keep on for 24 hours a day to give you that many answers.”
What else do you think guys around the league will like about it?",4/26/17
chief-technology-officer-whoop-4-0-accuracy,Chief Technology Officer on Improved Accuracy & Design with WHOOP 4.0,"Taking advantage of the expanded sensor capabilities and the huge dataset, our signal processing team developed new cutting-edge algorithms to boost the accuracy of our heart rate measurements. Compared to the WHOOP 3.0, the WHOOP 4.0 on average has a 10% improvement in accuracy across all activities we studied.
This marks just the beginning of what is capable with our new sensing system. Throughout the life of WHOOP 4.0, we will continue collecting data sets through WHOOP Labs and increasing the heart rate accuracy. These updates will come as firmware updates (where we can upgrade your hardwear while it’s on your wrist) alongside other improvements and new features to your WHOOP 4.0.",10/21/21
chief-technology-officer-whoop-4-0-accuracy,Chief Technology Officer on Improved Accuracy & Design with WHOOP 4.0,"We are very excited to share the amazing technology we have been working on for over 2 years: The WHOOP 4.0. For both existing members and new members, I’d like to provide with more of the details on the innovations inside and the design thinking that went into building the WHOOP 4.0.
As with all products and features we make at WHOOP, our members and the feedback they provide form the core of our research and development. There are 5 central themes that emerged from this feedback that we focussed heavily on with the WHOOP 4.0:
1. Continue to improve the excellent heart rate measurement accuracy of the WHOOP sensor 2. Reduce the size of the WHOOP to allow it to fit better on more wrist sizes and improve the aesthetics of the device 3. Allow members to change bands quickly and easily and simplify the process of finding the right tightness (and saving it that way) 4. Improve the durability of the battery pack and make it water resistant 5. Make the user experience (UX) of the hardware easier to understand",10/21/21
chief-technology-officer-whoop-4-0-accuracy,Chief Technology Officer on Improved Accuracy & Design with WHOOP 4.0,"The Fast Link™ Slider and WHOOP Body
Along with the mechanical changes to facilitate the decrease in size, WHOOP developed an innovative design and system to allow members to swap between their favorite bands in a much quicker manner. The Fast Link slider lets members find the optimal tightness of their band and never have to re-thread it when changing to another one.
THE WHOOP 4.0 FEATURES A FAST LINK SLIDER TO EASILY REMOVE the band FROM THE SENSOR.
The decrease in size and Fast Link system opened up a revolution in wearable technology–truly making wearables wearable throughout the body. The WHOOP 4.0 can easily be worn all over the body with our new apparel line, WHOOP Body. The first collection allows you to place the sensor in boxers, bras, shorts, performance leggings, and shirts, and we will continue researching and developing more sophisticated smart garments.
## Waterproof Charger
Another frequent piece of feedback we received was that the battery pack needed to be water resistant. Forgetting to take it off when getting in the shower or jumping in a pool was an all too common occurrence for WHOOP members (and members of our team too).
The major challenge in waterproofing the battery pack was the contact points that allowed charging to happen between it and the device. These are intricate electro-mechanical structures which have additional complexity due to the sliding nature of how it attaches. The solution we found was to enable the battery pack to charge the device wirelessly, thus removing the need for those contacts.
In fact, we were able to achieve the same IP rating (IP 68) for dust proofness and water-resistance for the battery pack as for the WHOOP 4.0 sensor. The battery pack itself charges over USB-C and a cable is included when you upgrade or buy a WHOOP 4.0.",10/21/21
chief-technology-officer-whoop-4-0-accuracy,Chief Technology Officer on Improved Accuracy & Design with WHOOP 4.0,"New Sensor and Improved Heart Rate Accuracy
Measuring a member’s physiology continuously, 24/7, with high accuracy and reliability is the top priority of our world-class signal processing team. With the WHOOP 4.0, we revisited our sensor configuration to further increase the signal quality and open the doors to more complicated signal processing techniques. This enabled us to elevate and refine our ability to measure a member’s heart rate and heart rate variability.
As one can see from the sensor, there are marked differences from the 3.0 to the 4.0–namely the inclusion of 4 photodiodes, or light sensors, (compared to 1 in the 3.0), 3 green LEDs (vs 2 in the 3.0) and the addition of both an infrared and red LED.
Additionally, the arrangement of the sensors and emitters has also changed. These modifications are not random, but rather the result of over 9 years of direct study and 2 years of focused effort on improving the WHOOP sensor. Over 70 different prototype configurations were developed in the process of making WHOOP 4.0, with each prototype informed by theoretical models and simulations and also backed by benchtop and empirical studies on human participants.
The results obtained are directly tied to the investment we’ve made in WHOOP Labs, which allowed us to make improvements by studying the properties of the signal quality on over 4,000 unique individuals generating over 20,000 data sets and 50 million heart beats! It is critical that WHOOP works on everyone, no matter the skin tone, anatomy of the wrist, gender, etc. Diversity in study participants was essential to ensure optimal performance in all conditions.
The final sensor configuration that produced the best results can be seen here:
THE WHOOP 4.0 SENSOR HAS 5 LEDS (3 green, 1 red, 1 infrared) AND 4 PHOTODIODES.",10/21/21
chief-technology-officer-whoop-4-0-accuracy,Chief Technology Officer on Improved Accuracy & Design with WHOOP 4.0,"Smaller Size
To better accommodate feedback from our growing member base and also advance the innovative design of the WHOOP sensor, we knew we needed to make the WHOOP 4.0 smaller than its predecessors.
Reducing the size of the WHOOP 3.0 was a daunting task, and we made it even more ambitious by including over 100 additional components on the circuit boards. This allowed us to introduce new features such as SpO2 monitoring and skin temperature sensing, as well as a haptics engine, a relatively large component. By pushing the boundaries of electrical engineering and printed circuit board design, along with innovative mechanical engineering to maximize the use of internal space, our team was able to cut down the size of the WHOOP 4.0 by 33% compared to the WHOOP 3.0. The end result is a sleek device that fits comfortably on wrists of all sizes.
## Next-Generation Battery
Making wearables smaller often means decreasing battery life since batteries tend to be the largest component by volume. However, this was something we were determined to avoid. WHOOP is always on the lookout for innovative partners that are developing next-generation technology. We knew that finding a partner to help us deliver more energy, so we could power our devices with more features, sensors, and components without compromising on form factor or battery life, would be essential.
More than two years ago, we found Sila Nanotechnologies and were inspired by their mission to develop the first major innovation in battery energy improvements in over 30 years. Both companies saw the promise of each other’s technologies and a natural synergy. We are proud that WHOOP 4.0 is the first product in the world to be powered by Sila’s new silicon-anode chemistry, which allows for a smaller battery than WHOOP 3.0 but with a much higher energy density–meaning we did not have to sacrifice battery life.",10/21/21
chief-technology-officer-whoop-4-0-accuracy,Chief Technology Officer on Improved Accuracy & Design with WHOOP 4.0,"Simpler User Experience
Finally, the UX for understanding the state of charge and various operating states of the battery pack and sensor were oftentimes confusing with WHOOP 3.0. We overhauled this system by using RGB LEDs and a simpler green, yellow, and red system for understanding state of charge.
Furthermore, the 4.0 battery pack was upgraded to include an accelerometer with the ability to track double taps and allow members to check on the charge of the battery pack on its own. A detailed breakdown of the states can be found here on our support page.
## …And More
While we’ve covered a lot on the hardware upgrades to WHOOP 4.0, this is just the tip of the iceberg. We also included new sensors to measure pulse oximetry and skin temperature, improvements to the Bluetooth Low Energy antenna for more reliable connections, and more. As always, we look forward to continuing to develop features on this revolutionary new platform!",10/21/21
chris-mazdzer,'Ultimate Sledding' - 9 Questions with Team USA's Chris Mazdzer,"Chris Mazdzer is a two-time Olympian who will once again be representing Team USA Luge at the 2018 winter games in PyeongChang. We had the opportunity to chat with Chris about his training, why he started using WHOOP, and what it’s like to slide down the ice at close to 90 miles per hour.
### So Chris, why luge?
“I grew up in the northernmost part of New York, 45 minutes away from Lake Placid. We have some serious winters there. When I was little, my dad would always build sledding hills in our front yard. I think that’s when I got hooked. There was a program for kids ages 8-13 for bobsled and luge, I signed up as soon as I was old enough. For me, the issue with bobsled was you only got to drive half the time. Plus, the line was always longer and it had a much slower turnover. With luge, I could get a lot more runs in–it was ultimate sledding. It quickly became my passion in the winter time. When I was 12 years old, I was put on the development team. A year later, they saw something in me and took me to Europe when I was 13. I’ve been traveling the world ever since.”",1/4/18

How do you improve your reaction time?
“In our start house in Lake Placid, we have a gate that opens up so we can practice getting quick starts. I also like to do a lot of different sports in addition to working out and what’s on our training regimen. I think it helps mentally to throw a variety of things at your body. Volleyball, soccer, mountain biking, riding a motorcycle, canyoneering, cliff jumping–I do everything. The more you do, the more you can improve how fast your body assess situations and reacts.”
Training Cycle: Set a goal, figure out how to achieve that goal, work on it, take two big steps forward, fail, take a step backwards, spend time figuring out what’s going on (pictured above), still fail, get frustrated, re-evaluate, make progress, build on that progress, conquer frustration, slap negative thoughts in the face, achieve goal, make new goal, repeat. #teamusa #roadtopyeongchang #roadtofrustration #lakeplacid #luge #filuge #puttinginwork #spandex #lifeofaluger

### What got you started on WHOOP?
What got you started on WHOOP?
“I’d played around with a few other wearable devices in the past, but this seemed a lot more encompassing. I really liked how WHOOP was based on Recovery rather than counting your steps and calories. As soon as I gave it a try, I loved it.”
### What does WHOOP do for you?
What does WHOOP do for you?
“The scary thing about the device is that it knows me better than I know me. I travel a lot and there used to be so many times I’d get off the plane and mentally feel 100% the next day, but then I’d notice myself dragging in the weight room and not know why. With WHOOP, I can see when my Recovery is down. That’s the thing that amazes me the most, WHOOP knowing how ready to go I am each day and how hard I can push. It helps you listen to your body better and it’s great to have those quantifiable metrics on how you feel.”",1/4/18
chris-mazdzer,'Ultimate Sledding' - 9 Questions with Team USA's Chris Mazdzer,"What kind of athletic shape do you have to be in for luge?
What kind of athletic shape do you have to be in for luge?
“That’s probably the hardest thing to get across to people. When we’re going down the track, it really looks like we’re not doing much of anything. But that’s because we have such good control of our body movements, and if we do move a lot it messes up aerodynamics and it’s harder to control the sled. I’d say it takes 6-10 years of practice to be able to confidently go down a luge track.
Physically, we have to be in shape to pull the start–we use our hands to pull off handles and then we’re paddling on the ice to gain speed, so it’s an upper-body explosive movement. Even though we’re not running, it’s still very power based. Then once we’re on the track, it’s complete finesse.”

### Tell us about the training you do.
Tell us about the training you do.
“We have a mix of explosive training and coordination. It really encompasses a lot of variables and balances a lot of different factors. For example, you obviously need a strong upper body for the start, but if you’re too big and bulky on the sled you’re not going to be able to drive it well. I try to do a bit of everything. So much of the sport is mental and you have to have extremely fast reactions to difficult situations. If you think about what you need to do, it can already be too late, you have to rely on instincts. When you come out of corners and you’re an inch off the wall, you have to stay perfectly relaxed. If you tense up, that’s when the sled is going to get out of control. Reaction-time training is key.”",1/4/18

That looks terrifying. And so does luge in general. Aren’t you afraid?
“Sometimes I still am nervous. But I think having that little bit of nervousness is necessary, it keeps you on your edge. That’s another reason why this sport takes so long to get good at. It’s not terrifying, but it’s uneasy and it constantly makes you push yourself to learn new things. You also move up the track really slowly with luge, you don’t start at the top until you’re ready.
We have a lot of control on the sled, but when we get out of control it’s really bad. We become projectiles more so than a bobsled or skeleton. It’s a steep learning curve and it’s our shoulders that take the brunt of it. There’s definitely pain and bruises and ice burn that comes from moving up the track. Often it’s not a pleasant experience. Sometimes there are tracks that you just won’t get and you know it’s going to be a rough week.”
After a pretty long and exhausting month I have finally hit a point where my spirit and motivation feel like breaking. I get so frustrated when it feels that I am putting 100% into something and I see 0 progress. Although the picture just looks like I hit a few walls the mental pain runs much deeper because it feels like the late night/early mornings over the past summer have been for nothing… but from this point we all have a choice. Give up, or wake up with purpose and continue to grind. Although this feeling sucks and I wish I could lay in bed for a single day, I know I need to continue because I have unfinished business. Showing up everyday is half the battle and currently it seems the only thing that I will always do right. There are so many people in my life that motivate me and I want to say thank you, because you help me show up everyday and not give up even though sometimes I want to. #ittakesavillage #roadtopyeongchang #thisroadsuckssometimes #justdoit #teamusa #thankyou",1/4/18

christian-harris-crossfit-open-workout-21-2,"Christian Harris Talks CrossFit Open & Workout 21.2, Shares His WHOOP Data","“I first did the workout on Friday, so preparation started the day before. I woke up Thursday feeling very sore in my glutes and hamstrings, so I started the day with a 45-minute active recovery flow, which included the bike and ski erg, and running. Then I mobilized and did a long stretching routine. The rest of the day I made sure I stayed hydrated and ate well.
I wake up early (5:03 am) to coach at 6 am, so in order for me to get a good night’s sleep I have to go to bed pretty early. The Open announcement at 8 pm throws a little wrench in the bedtime plan–I don’t get to bed until about 9 pm. After coaching the 6 and 9 am classes I started my warmup and got after 21.2. I was pleased with how I did, but after talking with my team we decided to re-do it together on Sunday to push each other to perform better.”
5. Can you give us some insight as to what goes through your head when you’re doing a workout like this?
“Slow is smooth and smooth is fast. When you are doing a workout with an increasing rep scheme it is typically a trap to want to sprint the first couple of sets, which will make you hit a wall later in the workout. Start smooth and try to pick up the pace on the back half of the workout.”
6. How will WHOOP help you sharpen your edges throughout the Open this year?
“During this time of year proper recovery is essential to good performance and WHOOP helps me in many ways to do that. One of the things I definitely make sure to keep an eye on is my strain-recovery balance on Wednesday into Thursday.

1. What are your feelings about the 2021 season? Are your emotions a source of fuel or something you try to quiet?
“I feel excited about the new format and I like that they are bringing it back to having stages throughout the season, which allows for a proper off-season. My mindset this Open season is different from how it has been in the past in the sense that my emotions used to be a source of fuel. After the 2020 season being canceled on the team side, I am trying to not put so much emphasis on letting the Open workouts dictate my emotions.

circadian-rhythm-sleep-consistency,Understanding Circadian Rhythm & Benefits of Maintaining It with Sleep Consistency,"Circadian rhythm is your body’s 24-hour internal clock, which regulates your sleep/wake cycle. Below we’ll explain how it works, what can disrupt it, how to maintain it and the benefits of doing so, plus how to figure out exactly what yours is.
## What Is Circadian Rhythm?
The word “circadian” is based on the Latin terms for “around” (circa) and “day” (diem), so your “around-the-day” rhythm dictates the cycles your body goes through–most notably when you wake up and fall asleep.
Your circadian clock is controlled by a part of your brain called the hypothalamus that responds to light. As it gets dark, your brain tells your body to begin producing melatonin, which makes you feel tired.
## How Does Circadian Rhythm Affect Sleep? Early Bird Vs Night Owl
Although sunlight and the light-dark cycle play a significant role in your circadian rhythm, some people have a natural predisposition towards feeling more awake and energized in the morning (referred to as “early birds” or “larks”), while others are more active and alert in the evening (“night owls”). Opinions on this vary and there is a wide range in between, but it’s generally assumed that more people fall closer to the category of “early birds.” It’s also true that with standard school, work and business hours, society functions more to their body clocks’ benefit.
Additionally, circadian rhythms tend to change and evolve with age. Children, teenagers, adults and seniors all have different times that their bodies want to get up, eat, go to sleep, etc.",6/5/21
circadian-rhythm-sleep-consistency,Understanding Circadian Rhythm & Benefits of Maintaining It with Sleep Consistency,"Disruptions to The Circadian Rhythm
Shift work with frequently changing hours, jet lag from switching time zones, certain medical conditions, or even simply choosing to stay up late one night are all things that can throw off your sleep patterns and circadian rhythm. In the long run, studies show this can negatively impact your health in a variety of ways.
Many of us often look to catch up on lost sleep on the weekends, unfortunately averaging 8 hours of sleep per night is not the same thing as getting 8 hours of sleep every night. In fact, “sleeping in” one or two days a week can actually disrupt your biological clock by creating an irregular sleep-wake rhythm.
## How to Find your Circadian Rhythm
How do I fix my circadian rhythm? Resetting circadian rhythm, or in truth finding out what your natural circadian cycle really is, is easy if you have the time. Simply go to bed when you feel tired, and don’t use an alarm to get up in the morning. Do this for several days, and eventually you’ll discover exactly when your body wants to be asleep.
## Maintain a Healthy Circadian Rhythm with Sleep Consistency
Exposing yourself to natural light in the morning and avoiding screens and other sources of artificial light in the evening prior to bed will help align your sleep cycles and reinforce your circadian rhythm (regular light and dark times are a key factor as well).
The most important thing you can do to maintain it is focus on your sleep consistency–going to bed and waking up as close to the same time each day as possible.
Sticking to consistent bed and wake times, tracked in the WHOOP app, helps maintain your circadian rhythm.
Your sleep quality will improve and your body will perform better when it can anticipate the onset of sleep every night. Much more on this below…",6/5/21
circadian-rhythm-sleep-consistency,Understanding Circadian Rhythm & Benefits of Maintaining It with Sleep Consistency,"How Circadian Rhythm Affects Health: Benefits of Sleep Consistency
A 2017 Harvard study discovered that students with consistent sleep and wake times had higher GPA’s than others, despite not actually getting more sleep. WHOOP used this as motivation to begin tracking sleep consistency, and the results we’ve found are staggering. Our data shows that better sleep consistency contributes to:
• More REM sleep, the mentally restorative stage of sleep
• Increased slow wave (deep) sleep, the physically restorative stage
• Lower resting heart rate
• Higher heart rate variability (HRV)
• Improved mental health
We’ve also learned that greater sleep consistency helps you fall asleep faster, and improves your overall sleep efficiency (the percentage of time in bed that you’re actually asleep):
WHOOP data shows that keeping your circadian rhythm aligned with sleep consistency also improves the efficiency of your sleep.
“I started doubling down on sleep consistency and I’ve seen a huge, huge improvement in the time I’m spending in deeper stages of sleep, and I’m actually spending less time in bed.” – Podcast 17: The Circadian Rhythm Sleep Hack
## The WHOOP Sleep Planner Incorporates Your Circadian Rhythm
WHOOP is 3rd-party validated to accurately track your sleep in great detail, including a breakdown of the amount of time you spend in each stage of sleep. The app’s Sleep Planner monitors your circadian rhythm and uses it to make nightly recommendations for exactly how much sleep you need, as well as precisely when to go to bed and wake up in order to maximize your sleep consistency and get the highest quality sleep possible.

college-football-and-the-dangers-of-overtraining,College Football and the Dangers of Overtraining,"These are just two recent examples illustrating a much broader issue, according to Dennis Dodd of CBS Sports:
“College football has never been more dangerous. This is not a hot take. It remains a fact, a reminder. Since 2000, at least 21 players have died basically from overexertion — not from a blow to the head or a hit that left anyone paralyzed.
They died because they were run/exercised to death in the offseason or in practice. Usually without pads or hitting. And not in games. Overexertion remains the leading cause of football-related death this century.”
When the topic of overtraining comes up, it’s often in reference to an athlete failing to peak at the ideal time, or suffering setbacks due to injury. Potentially life-threatening consequences rarely enter the conversation. What is it about the college football environment that lends itself to such perils? The Ringer’s Rodger Sherman offers this explanation:
“While few fans can name their team’s strength coach, he’s perhaps the most important person on a school’s coaching roster besides the head coach. An NFL strength coach doesn’t matter as much: Everybody on his team is already a grown man. A college strength coach has to turn high schoolers into grown men as quickly as possible. If you’ve got 19-year-olds who are as strong as another program’s 21-year-olds, you’re gonna win some games.”
The team mentality also plays a major role. College football rosters can have as many as 105 players. That’s 105 different bodies with 105 different physiologies, not all of whom are capable of handling the same level of Strain. If every athlete is asked to undergo the same workout, it may be just right for some, but too difficult for others–possibly even dangerous.
By monitoring each individual’s Strain and Recovery, coaches can avoid pushing players beyond their capabilities and much of the risk can be eliminated.",1/25/17
college-football-and-the-dangers-of-overtraining,College Football and the Dangers of Overtraining,"Earlier this month, three Division 1 college football players were hospitalized following a series of grueling strength and conditioning workouts with their team. One of the players complained of having very sore arms and was diagnosed with a condition known as rhabdomyolysis. Others also complained of discolored urine, a symptom of rhabdomyolysis.
Rhabdo, for short, occurs when damaged muscle tissue breaks down and enters the bloodstream, potentially causing kidney failure. Sports Illustrated’s Jamie Lisanti wrote:
“A lot of rhabdomyolysis cases are seen when people have taken a few weeks or months off and jump right back in, [Dr. Michael M.] Joyner [expert in human performance at the Mayo Clinic] says. Inexperienced exercisers need to use caution, but even skilled, elite athletes who are coming off a vacation or extended break from fitness—also known as detrained athletes—are at risk if workouts aren’t adjusted according to the current state of fitness.”
The players had just returned to school after a month-long winter break, during which they were left to work out at their own discretion. It had also been a full six weeks since the team had trained together.
From Chantel Jennings of ESPN.com: “A source told ESPN that the workouts consisted of circuits including 10 push-ups, 10 sit-ups, 10 body-weight squats and two planks (30 seconds each) on a timed count. … The source said the team had been split up into three groups — based on class schedules — and if one player in the group failed to make the time, the unit started over from the beginning of that rep.”
OregonLive.com reported some of the players tested for high levels of creatine kinase, a common indicator of rhabdo. However, there were also members of the team who felt the conditioning exercises were not out of the ordinary.
A similar incident occurred five years ago, when 13 players from one school were hospitalized with rhabdo after a strenuous workout on their first day back from a three-week break.",1/25/17

cornell-study-whoop-sleep-data-alzheimers-risk,Cornell Study Uses WHOOP Sleep Data to Monitor Patients at Risk for Alzheimer’s,"The Study
The Alzheimer’s Prevention Clinic provided study subjects who were at risk of AD due to a family history, most of whom (72.7%) were healthy and asymptomatic. The research team at Weill Cornell used machine learning to divide the study’s 34 subjects into two groups based on biometric data collected by WHOOP. They then compared the two groups’ performance on a battery of cognitive testing, as well as on blood lipid and inflammatory markers – two tests typically used to stage AD severity.
Interestingly, there was no difference in the data collected from blood testing but there was a difference in cognitive test performance. What this result seems to suggest is that non-invasive WHOOP data collected over time correlated with cognitive test performance better than did invasive laboratory testing.
Most significantly, the Weill Cornell research team found that Group 1 spent a larger proportion of their sleep in slow wave sleep than did Group 2, and scored higher on a cognitive test associated with the health of the prefrontal cortex. This result is further supported by research done by another group prior to the present study which also linked reduced slow wave sleep to atrophy of the prefrontal cortex. However, this was the first study to show that slow wave sleep identified by a wrist-worn wearable device correlated with performance on this cognitive test.",2/10/20
cornell-study-whoop-sleep-data-alzheimers-risk,Cornell Study Uses WHOOP Sleep Data to Monitor Patients at Risk for Alzheimer’s,"Future Implications
While this study was small and there is still more research to be done, what it suggests is that long-term tracking of sleep, and specifically percent of time spent in slow wave sleep, could reveal an early warning sign of AD that most people aren’t currently being tested for. According to the study’s authors, this could enable clinicians to begin risk reduction interventions earlier than they are currently able to.
This isn’t just exciting for us here at WHOOP, it’s also really exciting news for everyone concerned about cognitive decline. When asked about satisfaction with wearing WHOOP device, 88.9% of the study participants reported that after the 6 month study they wanted to keep wearing the device. While this is obviously a flattering validation of the comfort and usability of our product, it is also proof that using non-invasive technologies, such as WHOOP, is an effective and user-friendly way to monitor long-term changes in sleep trends and therefore in wellness.
Some research suggests that interventions to increase slow wave sleep could mitigate cognitive decline due to aging and AD. Savvy WHOOP members might be surprised to learn that slow wave sleep, which we generally talk about as being associated with physical recovery, is so significant in the AD pathway. While this might initially be unexpected, it’s not in any way contradictory of our understanding of slow wave sleep. Although AD impacts cognitive performance, the actual impairment is largely attributed to the physical accumulation Beta Amyloid plaques, and during slow wave sleep we physically clear out the plaques that accumulated throughout the day. If someone is not getting enough slow wave sleep, the plaques can accumulate faster than they are cleared, resulting in a net increase which can really add up over time.",2/10/20

You can read their full publication here, but we explain the key findings and what they mean for you and your WHOOP data below.
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases. While it remains incurable, AD develops gradually and medical intervention can slow the disease’s progression. In theory, the disease starts doing permanent neurological damage long before clinically significant symptoms present. So, if we knew that someone was in this early stage, disease halting interventions could be started, resulting in a person’s symptom-free years being extended and their quality of life improved.

WHOOP members who’ve been vaccinated have the opportunity to report the event in our Journal feature. We took a look at the first 1,200 members who reported receiving the first shot of the vaccine and what it did to their data:
Most WHOOP members actually showed no signs of decreased recovery following COVID-19 vaccination
21.6% of members showed significantly elevated resting heart rates (defined here as at least 10% above their 14-day baseline)
28.9% of members showed significantly depressed heart rate variability (defined here as at least 20% below their 14-day baseline)
To help give context to this data, following vaccination 23.8% of WHOOP members had a red recovery (less than or equal to 33%), which is nearly double the typical number of red recoveries we see in a random sampling (12-13%).
However, unlike what we saw in WHOOP members who came down with COVID-19, these declines were very short lived and the distribution of resting heart rate, HRV and recovery among those vaccinated was not statistically significantly different from random member data samples by the second day after vaccination.",1/26/21
covid-19-vaccine-effects-data,Impact of COVID-19 Vaccination on WHOOP Data,"Within only four weeks of the FDA giving emergency use authorization for the first COVID-19 vaccinations, more than 20 million Americans have already been vaccinated against the deadly disease. Many WHOOP members have reached out to us about their vaccine experiences and asked us to share data on what it does to their bodies. Below we’ll review some of the science behind vaccines and discuss data from WHOOP members following COVID-19 vaccinations.
## How Vaccines Work
The general idea behind a vaccine is to expose your body to something that looks like a harmful pathogen (disease causing organism) but is actually harmless. These harmless look-alikes are sometimes the pathogen itself in a dead or weakened form that makes it easier for our bodies to eliminate, or they can be a protein or carbohydrate taken from the pathogen.
Regardless of the vaccine type, the goal is to give your immune system a practice round–it easily defeats the look-alike, but from that exposure develops antibodies that work on the disease-causing pathogen. If we are later exposed to a pathogen that we’ve been immunized against, our immune system is able to quickly recognize it as something it has seen before and can mount a successful response before the disease takes hold. That is what allows us to be exposed without getting sick.
## Can Vaccines Make You Sick?
This is a common myth, you can’t actually get sick from vaccines. While you might get mild symptoms of being sick, those are actually symptoms of immune system activation and mean that the vaccine is working. When our immune system is activated, symptoms like fatigue, chills, headaches and mild fevers may happen, but they typically subside in a day or two.
The CDC is a great resource to learn more about vaccines against COVID-19 and other diseases.",1/26/21
covid-19-vaccine-effects-data,Impact of COVID-19 Vaccination on WHOOP Data,"Planning for Your Vaccine
CDC guidelines strongly recommend that everyone get the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it is available to them. Because some WHOOP members who have been vaccinated have experienced temporary declines in recovery, you can take advantage of this knowledge and plan lower-strain days after getting vaccinated (as your body may not be in a position to take on a lot of load).
You may also better prepare for your vaccine by getting extra sleep the night before. Research by Dr. Aric Prather out of USCF showed that if people are sleep deprived when they receive a vaccine they may be less likely to develop protective antibodies. Therefore, we suggest members meet their sleep need with the Sleep Planner set to “Peak” to maximize the effectiveness of their vaccine.
The data shared here is only from the first 1,200 WHOOP members to report a vaccine, so there is still a lot to learn. You can contribute to our understanding of the physiological response to the COVID-19 vaccine by letting us know through the Journal when you get vaccinated.

The averages we discuss below are the aggregate data from everyone who logged a CrossFit Training activity in the WHOOP app during the Open (3/12-3/15, 3/19-3/22 and 3/26-3/29).
## Sleep Performance and Recovery During the CrossFit Open
Average sleep performance dropped slightly after the Open began. In the week prior, it was 89%. Spanning all the dates over which the Open took place (3/12-3/29), it dipped to 88%.
The average recovery across days of Open competition was 56%. Suspecting it might decrease following athlete’s workouts, we took a look at the days afterwards as well. However, on 3/16, 3/23 and 3/30 (all Tuesdays), the average recovery was 59%. This likely has more to do with the days of the week–Open workouts primarily took place on the weekends, and in general WHOOP members have the highest recoveries early in the week.
## CrossFit Open HRV and Resting Heart Rate
Overall, the average heart rate variability throughout the Open was 65 milliseconds. It was 66 ms in the first week though, and not surprisingly fell as the Open progressed.

The average day strain in the CrossFit community was 11.3 during the Open. For workouts logged as CrossFit Training, the average activity strain was 9.8. That number varied somewhat across the different workouts. In the time period of 21.1 (3/12-3/15) it was 9.8, during 21.2 (3/19-3/22) it was 9.7, and for 21.3 and 21.4 (3/26-3/29) it was 10.0.
Across all CrossFit Training activities, the average heart rate was 126 bpm, with an average max heart rate of 170 bpm. Max HR was a bit higher during the 21.1 dates (171 bpm) than it was for the rest of the Open (169 bpm).
In terms of calories burned, the average for CrossFit activities during the Open was 346. That total rose throughout, from 335 during 21.1, to 339 in 21.2, to 363 in 21.3/21.4.",4/3/21

cumulative-day-strain-as-a-tool-for-ballplayers-in-spring-training,Cumulative Day Strain As a Tool for Ballplayers in Spring Training,"Access to this information might be highly beneficial to ballplayers in spring training (and beyond). A round of golf, for example, causes an average Strain of 8.9. Pitchers might think they’re taking time off to relax, but in reality it’s similar to working out. Even the seemingly inconsequential activities like shagging fly balls in the outfield take their toll. Knowing exactly how much strain they’re putting on their bodies each day could go a long way towards helping players stay healthy while preparing for the long season ahead.

cumulative-day-strain-as-a-tool-for-ballplayers-in-spring-training,Cumulative Day Strain As a Tool for Ballplayers in Spring Training,"While they rarely take batting practice, many pitchers enjoy chasing after fly balls in the outfield. I think it’s fun,” relief pitcher Drew Storen told the Post in 2014. “Standing around, that’s how you get to know everybody. It’s fun to go out there and act like you’re an outfielder.” Storen’s former teammate and fellow reliever Tyler Clippard added that he prefers not to get to the park too early:
“There’s nothing to do. For me as a reliever, I have to get all my working out and my stuff done after the game because I don’t want to fatigue myself in case I have to pitch. I’m a guy who gets here as late as possible because I’ve got nothing to do.”
Clippard’s point of not wanting to be run down before a game even starts is a good one–but there’s likely more to that strategy than he even realizes.
One of the key things WHOOP does is measure strain. Not just strain from specific workouts, but a cumulative level of Day Strain. Everything you do over the course of the day puts strain on your body, and WHOOP keeps a running total.
A new White Paper from the WHOOP Department of Physiology and Analytics entitled The Advantage of Continuous Physiological Monitoring details the value of using Day Strain (as opposed to just Strain from workouts) when calculating how much sleep a person needs to be properly recovered the next day.
An average cycling workout of 30-60 minutes earns a Strain of 9.2 on the 0-21 scale WHOOP uses. Weightlifting for that amount of time averages a 6.7. The paper examines a recent sample of WHOOP data that indicates users take on an average Strain of 9.3 from daily “non-workout” activities.
In other words, the monotonous things you do over the course of a regular day end up accumulating strain equivalent to another workout. Taking this additional Strain into account allows WHOOP to provide a more accurate and complete picture of Recovery.",2/27/17
cumulative-day-strain-as-a-tool-for-ballplayers-in-spring-training,Cumulative Day Strain As a Tool for Ballplayers in Spring Training,"While winter still has its grip on much of the country, MLB teams have headed south and west to Florida and Arizona in order to prepare for the upcoming season. Baseball’s Opening Day is still more than a month away, but clubs began playing exhibition games this past week.
Historically, spring training was viewed as an opportunity for players to work their way back into shape before the season began. However, with today’s athletes, that’s no longer the case. From Adam Kilgore of the Washington Post:
“Ballplayers report in peak physical condition, after a winter of refined workouts often overseen by professional trainers. And then, for the first 10 days of their season — before the month of irrelevant exhibitions — they shag batting practice fly balls or wait their turn to cycle into drills practicing bunt plays and rundowns.”
Kilgore notes that players spend a good portion of their spring training simply trying not to get hurt. He also quotes Washington Nationals infielder Ryan Zimmerman, who said “People are showing up more ready than they used to be, and we haven’t really changed anything. We haven’t adjusted to what the professional athlete does in the offseason now. I understand it. For me as a position player, it’s unnecessary.”
Beginning next year the MLB exhibition season will be two days shorter, but that won’t affect how players spend their days. Via Sports on Earth, here’s what one minor leaguer had to say about his spring training experience last year:
“There’s a ton of downtime, though. That’s the only thing that’s a little rough. It does get a little bit boring. You sit in the hotel all day. We eat a good amount. [Go to the] movies. Shop. A lot of pitchers golf. [But] there’s only so much shopping and eating that you can do.”",2/27/17
cycling-death-valley-impossible-route,A 700-Mile Bike Ride Through Death Valley Tracked by WHOOP,"## Cycling the Impossible Route
The “impossible route” mantra is about overcoming what you once thought was impossible. This is different for everyone, for some an impossible route is a volcano, for others it’s their first century (100-mile ride), and for some it’s simply riding that first mile. We set out to push ourselves to the breaking point and beyond with a goal of inspiring others to conquer their own personal “impossible route.”
I attempted this impossible route with my friend and professional mountain bike racer Jeremiah Bishop. It was a 7-day, 700-mile adventure through the heart of the Mojave Desert and Death Valley on rigid suspension gravel bikes (basically road bikes with bigger tires). We rode a well-known motorcycle course called the California Backcountry Discovery Route (CABDR), but nobody had ever attempted it on a bicycle before.
Tyler Pearce and Jeremiah Bishop on Day 1 of their “impossible route” through Death Valley.
Jeremiah and I decided that we needed to finish each stage under our own support (customary in mountain bike stage racing), which meant carrying with us enough water and food to get from the start to the finish each day. Below I’ll dive into my WHOOP data and show how my body was affected by dehydration, lack of sleep, and massive efforts on the bike for 7 straight days.
You can check out the full film on my YouTube channel.",6/4/21
cycling-death-valley-impossible-route,A 700-Mile Bike Ride Through Death Valley Tracked by WHOOP,"Day 1: Red Recovery & Immense Strain
I came into the adventure a little under fit and heavy compared to my normal race fitness and weight. The thought was to prepare my body for major caloric deficits everyday and leave room for fatigue to build up. If I’d come in super lean and race fit, the first couple of days could have been fine, but by Day 5 or 6 I’m certain I would’ve cracked.
So, with a ton of pre-adventure nerves, I got less than 6 hours of sleep the night before we began. The travel day to get to the start also played a major role in kicking this off in the red (a 29% WHOOP recovery on Day 1). We had driven 14 hours to Yuma, AZ, and with the added stress of getting everything ready for the biggest week on the bike I’d ever done, I was wrecked.
It took us 10 hours of ride time to cover 117 miles of deep sand and steep climbs that day. I burned almost 7,000 calories, and there was no way I could bring that back in during the ride.

cycling-death-valley-impossible-route,A 700-Mile Bike Ride Through Death Valley Tracked by WHOOP,"Day 4: Restorative Sleep
Seeing my body bounce back into the green (74% recovery) prior to the hardest day of the adventure was huge for my morale. Although my total sleep wasn’t much better than previous nights, my time in REM (2:02) was significantly higher.
Tyler got an excellent amount of restorative REM sleep prior to Day 4.
Day 4 was 125 miles that covered the most hostile terrain I’ve ever ridden. We went through the heart of Death Valley and right by the Ibex Dunes. I actually felt really good the whole day, which was key to even having a shot at finishing.
## Day 5: Recovery on the Rise
Sleep was still hard to come by, we got in late the day before and woke up early. But, I continued trending upwards in my WHOOP metrics. My recovery was 82%, and my RHR, heart rate variability (HRV) and respiratory rate were looking good.
Day 5 was spectacular. We had lots of road (a much welcomed “break” of smoother riding), we got to ride through scenic Titus Canyon, and both Jeremiah and myself were feeling great! However, the course was long (101 miles) and we had no ability to refuel, so we ended up needing to pull the plug early when we ran out of light, calories, and water.
On Day 5, Tyler’s recovery was in the green and he was feeling good.
## Day 6: Heart Rate Variability Peaking
Howling winds overnight made for some difficult rest, but I was able to sleep in a bit and catch up what I could. Being 6 days in and seeing my highest HRV (122 ms after having dipped as low as 29 ms on Day 2) of the trip was crazy. I knew there was an extremely tough ride coming, so having that 91% recovery in my pocket was a life saver.
We put in another 10-hour day on the bike (and 72 miles), with several moments where quitting felt like the only option. Somehow we pushed through and made it to the finish. With only one day left to go there was no stopping now!
Day 6 featured 10 hours of cycling across some brutal terrain, leading to a 20.6 day strain for Tyler.",6/4/21
cycling-death-valley-impossible-route,A 700-Mile Bike Ride Through Death Valley Tracked by WHOOP,"Day 2: Elevated Resting Heart Rate
Waking up on Day 2 with a recovery score of 5% was a bit of a worrisome sign. I did actually get more sleep than I thought I would, but with so much strain the day before it was clearly not enough to properly recover. My resting heart rate (RHR) also jumped from 52 to 64 beats per minute!
There was a significant spike in Tyler’s resting heart rate following a very strenuous first day of riding.
I struggled to get moving, basically just putting one foot in front of the other. It was another 10 hours on the bike which saw us cover 132 miles, most of which included deep sand washes that made riding super difficult.
The day ended with an hour-long climb and we both ran out of food and water. We barely made it to the finish, and immediately rushed to hydrate and get food back in us so we could get to sleep as fast as possible. I needed some quality sleep to hopefully get my recovery back on track if I was going to have a chance to complete the next day.
## Day 3: Data Trending In the Right Direction
I managed 7 hours of sleep, which was pretty good considering how late we got in the day before and how early we had to wake up. While my recovery was still in the red, at least it was moving in the right direction (up to 24%). My RHR was still extremely high though (63 bpm), but I hoped Day 3 would be an easy one.
An “easy” Day 3 led to Tyler’s WHOOP data Heading in the right direction.
Luckily my wishes were answered, and we had a blazing tailwind over a much easier course. I still felt like a sack of potatoes, but with “only” 5 hours on the bike and 70 miles to ride we ended with plenty of time to fuel, shower, and recover before the biggest and most challenging day of the trip.",6/4/21
cycling-death-valley-impossible-route,A 700-Mile Bike Ride Through Death Valley Tracked by WHOOP,"Day 7: Finishing in the Green
With my largest amount of total sleep yet (7:29), I woke up on the last day to another green recovery. My RHR was back down to normal (44 bpm) and my body had seemingly adapted to this level of strain (a string of 20.6s and 20.7s) every day. I actually felt better on the final day of this journey than I had in weeks!
Despite near-max strain For 7 straight days of cycling, Tyler had an impressive string of green recoveries to close out the epic ride.
Amazingly we smashed the last stage, flying through the 8-hour ride and 91 miles with no issues. Jeremiah and I became the first people to complete the CABDR on bicycles.
The final day was mostly smooth sailing… Until Tyler crossed the finish line.
We did it! It’s done! I was feeling a sense of euphoria like never before… Then…
I crashed in the parking lot of the finish line. I had ridden 701 miles over the hardest terrain in America only to break my femur in a Taco Bell parking lot.
Sooooo… Yeahhhh.
My recovery the next day was 27%, and it was almost two weeks before I got it back in the green.

data-saved-my-life-heart-attack,How Understanding My WHOOP Data Helped Save My Life,"Being a big golf addict, I’d read about a pro on the PGA Tour who had been able to recognize a deviation in his WHOOP data that led him to getting tested for COVID-19. Obviously, this is where my first thought went as well. There were plenty of people at the tournament and I could’ve been easily infected–I had to shake hands with the president for collecting my first-place prize, and so on.
And yet in my head I kept saying “You’re overreacting. Don’t be a hypochondriac. You probably just overdid it yesterday.” After taking another nap in the afternoon I didn’t feel that much better. In fact, the pressure I felt in my chest started to become constant, and at around 4:30 pm I began to feel dizzy and disoriented.
I checked my WHOOP data again and realized that my resting heart rate was through the roof. It’s usually right around 54 bpm, but on this day it had gone from 55 to 69. In addition to that, my heart rate variability dropped immensely from 53 to 27. In hindsight, I can’t believe that I didn’t think for one second about having a heart condition–my head was still stuck on coronavirus.
This is the moment I felt strongly that something was off and I decided it was time to consult a medical professional. First I called my brother-in-law who is a nurse, and he immediately told me to go to the emergency room. So I did.
I called ahead in advance (which is required by COVID-19 rules here in Switzerland) and went into the ER. After telling them about my symptoms, everything went really quickly. I waited about 5 minutes and got taken into a room, where already I had a doctor and 3 nurses waiting for me. They started setting an IV and ran an EKG test. This is obviously where it dawned on me that this was not a COVID test…",9/25/20
data-saved-my-life-heart-attack,How Understanding My WHOOP Data Helped Save My Life,"Most of you reading this title are probably thinking “This sounds a bit far fetched and exaggerated.” Others might be thinking it must be some sort of marketing stunt.
I’m here to tell you it means exactly what it says. If it weren’t for understanding my WHOOP data, I could be dead now.
I wouldn’t be able to write this story. My story. The story about how being in tune with my body and knowing my baseline WHOOP data may have saved my life. I don’t have a horse in this race, I’m not getting paid for doing this and I certainly don’t want anything for telling you what happened to me. I just want to share my experience with the world.
On Monday, August 24th, 2020, I suffered a severe heart attack. You might say “So what, that happens to plenty of people.” True, but I’m only 33 years old. Yes, that’s correct. I suffered a severe heart attack at the age of 33. As if 2020 isn’t the shittiest year already, am I right?
But let’s start at the beginning.
The day before the incident I played our golf club’s “Club Open,” and was not only able to win it, but actually defend my title for the second year in a row. Needless to say I was very excited and happy about it. I had my highest WHOOP strain to date (20.1 on a scale of 0-21), and my mood couldn’t have been better.
The next morning, I woke up with a slight pressure on my chest. Imagine someone sitting on your chest or having a kettlebell put on it. The pressure wasn’t constant, it came and went. I checked my WHOOP data from the night before and saw that my respiratory rate went up from 14.5 to 16.6. I recognized this as a potentially significant deviation from my baseline respiratory rate of 14.3, and knew that if this trend continued it could mean some sort of illness or distress.",9/25/20
data-saved-my-life-heart-attack,How Understanding My WHOOP Data Helped Save My Life,"After the EKG test spat out its results, I remember distinctly that my doctor said “Call the cardiologist and prep the OR.” That was when I finally opened my mouth and intervened. “Does anybody mind filling me in here??” The doctor replied with “Mr. Fritsche, it was very good that you came in. You had a severe heart attack and we will operate on you right away.”
Obviously, I was speechless and shocked. Never in a million years would I have guessed that at the age of 33 I’d have a doctor telling me this. Especially since I wouldn’t call myself an unhealthy person. I’m not overweight and I’m on the golf course at least 3 times a week. I watch what I eat, also.
After digesting the first shock of the diagnosis, I called my girlfriend (who was still waiting outside of the hospital thinking I’m having a COVID test), told her the news, and asked her to come in and inform my family.
The rest went by extremely fast. I got rolled into the OR where I had the procedure. The whole thing took maybe 40 minutes. It turns out my coronary artery was completely blocked.
My first night of recovery I spent in the ICU. I remember laying there and thinking “If I hadn’t had my WHOOP, I never would have known about my vitals dropping or rising. I wouldn’t have gone to the ER, and I would’ve spent the night at home.”
And according to my doctor, I would have died.
My cardiologist told me this after I recovered. He said “Mr. Fritsche, It was absolutely essential that you came in when you did. I had a case just today where a woman stayed at home for the night and came in the morning. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to do anything for her.”
So there it is. Thankfully I had my WHOOP data at my fingertips to be able to understand that something might be wrong, and could act accordingly. So you can imagine, I’m never EVER taking my WHOOP off again!",9/25/20
data-saved-my-life-heart-attack,How Understanding My WHOOP Data Helped Save My Life,"Below is my heart rate data from that day. My heart attack happened right around 4:30 pm. It’s also worth noting that my WHOOP recovery was just 2% that morning, despite the fact that I got a decent amount of sleep the night before.
That is my story.
I’m happy to report that my rehab is going very well, and I’m getting healthier by the day. I’ve even been able to get back out on the golf course! WHOOP has been great for tracking my rehab, as I can follow along as my metrics return to normal.

dave-hippensteel-fittest-60-year-old-earth,Training with the Fittest 60-Year-Old on Earth,"Hippensteel, the two-time defending champion in the Masters 60+ Division at the Reebok CrossFit Games, got into the sport at age 56 after a trip to see his daughter Heather in San Diego, CA. Heather, a former college diver at the University of San Diego, had quit her full-time job as an accountant to work at CrossFit Invictus and train with their competitive team. “When she told me about what she was doing I got really interested,” Dave said. “I went out to visit her and did some training. Then I got hooked.”
Most people don’t throw themselves head-on into a new sport in their mid 50s, but Hippensteel is not “most people.” A football player in high school, then a decathlete and springboard diver at Cal State Fresno in college, Hippensteel earned a graduate degree in dentistry from Temple University.
“I’ve always stayed active,” he said. “After dental school, I did triathlons off and on for about 20 years. I got into motocross when I turned 40, put a track in my front yard with a 90-foot jump and raced motorcycles for about five years. When I found CrossFit, originally I just wanted it to help me with my triathlon training, but I soon realized it was exactly the sport I’d been looking for. I’d always been strong for my size (5’8″, 160 lbs) and loved gymnastics, not to mention I had a real knack for it. CrossFit combines Olympic lifting with gymnastics skills, rope climbs, muscle-ups and other things like that. It was really a great match for me because I’ve always been a very versatile athlete, I just fell in love with it.”",10/5/17
dave-hippensteel-fittest-60-year-old-earth,Training with the Fittest 60-Year-Old on Earth,"“I started training seriously in 2012,” Hippensteel told us. “I put my sights on the next year’s Open, the first stage of qualifying for the Games. At first I just wanted to break into that top 20 and somehow maybe make it to the Games [in the men’s 55-59 age group]. It felt like a long shot, but I ended up winning the first Open event and managed to stay in first place for the entire five-week open competition. I got to go to the Games, where I finished fifth overall. I even won the clean and jerk with a 215 [lbs] despite being the lightest guy in the event. It was a pretty amazing experience for my first time there. CrossFit did an article on Heather and me as a father-daughter combo competing at the same Games. I learned a lot from her coach and just being around her team.”
Included in that article, which was published prior to the 2013 Games, was this quote from Heather about her father:
“He has a tendency to over-train, so the biggest thing I’m trying to help with is making sure he takes recovery days. Sometimes I’ll say, ‘I’m not going to talk to you about any of our workouts until you take a recovery day!’”

Dave returned to the Games in the Masters 55-59 Division in 2014. He was second overall in the Open and again finished fifth at the Games. In 2015, at age 59, he placed ninth. The following year, Hippensteel turned 60 and became eligible for a new age group. He dominated the 60+ Division at the 2016 Games, winning by more than 50 points.",10/5/17

dave-hippensteel-fittest-60-year-old-earth,Training with the Fittest 60-Year-Old on Earth,"Mastering Recovery
Finding time to train and recover at a high level is especially complicated for Hippensteel considering he still works five days a week as a dentist. “I don’t have a lot of margin time to make mistakes,” he told us. “I’ve got to be super efficient in everything, when I work out, balancing it with work, etc.”
This season, WHOOP helped Dave prioritize sleep, naps in particular:
“If I can get more deep sleep, no matter when it is, whether it’s a nap or at night, I need to be focused on that. The more I nap, the more recovered I get, I can see it in black and white. Figuring out when I can nap during the day was my biggest change this past summer. Whether it’s before or after a workout, dedicating nap time is huge. Seeing my WHOOP data can be very reassuring when I’ve hit my Sleep Need. Or, knowing when I didn’t sleep enough the night before and need a nap. Building that in has been key.”
In the month prior to the Games, Dave averaged 92% of his recommended daily Sleep Need. He also had great Sleep Regularity, going to bed and waking up at consistent times each day:
Additionally, Hippensteel found a coach for the first time this year (through Ben Bergeron’s CompTrain Masters program), Dan Delomba from CrossFit New England. “I still did a lot of my own programming working with Dan, he got to know me as an athlete,” Dave said. “If I needed a day off because my WHOOP said I should recover, I let Dan know and he was cool with it. I did many of the CompTrain workouts and followed them as a guideline, but I also mixed in some of my own to hammer out weaknesses.”

dave-hippensteel-fittest-60-year-old-earth,Training with the Fittest 60-Year-Old on Earth,"Heading into the 2017 Games, Dave was looking for an edge to stay on top. “I was experimenting with HRV (heart rate variability),” he said. “That was the buzzword I kept hearing about because I was really focusing on recovery. My son actually came across WHOOP, researched it and told me to check it out. What I had been using previously was helpful, but it didn’t get into HRV in your deepest sleep like WHOOP does.”
The timing for Dave was perfect. It was mid May and he’d just won the 60+ Masters online qualifier at the end of April. “I remember going into the gym and picking up 135 [lbs] right after the qualifier, which usually feels really light to me for the clean and jerk,” he explained. “I couldn’t even warm up with that, I was so spent. That’s when I knew I really needed to dig into this recovery thing. WHOOP was instrumental. I learned pretty quickly how to follow it and how to listen to it. I’d think to myself ‘this workout was OK, but what will it feel like when I’m actually 100% recovered?’”",10/5/17
dave-hippensteel-fittest-60-year-old-earth,Training with the Fittest 60-Year-Old on Earth,"Using WHOOP Through the Games
“It was really helpful to have WHOOP guide me into the Games,” Dave explained. “My last big workout was the Sunday before they started [on Thursday]. It was perfect, my Recoveries peaked at exactly the right time. The day the Games began was my highest Recovery ever. I went into the first day with a ton of confidence knowing that. I felt good and expected to be firing on all cylinders.”
As you can see below, Dave did an outstanding job matching his Strain (blue) and Recovery (green/yellow) leading up to the Games. Then he cut back his Strain and got two great night’s sleep (8:33 Tuesday and 9:27 Wednesday), allowing his Recovery to peak at 98% on Day 1 of the Games (Thursday, August 3):
“The first day of the Games, there was a mile-and-a-half run with a 700-meter swim. It was supposed to be 500 but everybody said it was 700,” Dave recalled. “I got a nap in on Day 1 too. It was really critical that I got to rest before the first event. Because of that, I was still in good Recovery mode (90%) the next day. On Friday (Day 2), I finished second in the first event and won the second event, everything felt super.”
“I just kept following my WHOOP data, having that reassurance that my body was ready for this. Day 3, my Recovery was still in the green (67%). I won the first event on Saturday and hit a PR (personal record) on a two-rep max front squat of 268 pounds. I ended up fifth in that event, not bad for the smallest guy competing.”",10/5/17
dave-hippensteel-fittest-60-year-old-earth,Training with the Fittest 60-Year-Old on Earth,"On Sunday, the fourth and final day, Hippensteel still posted a solid Recovery (50%) considering what he’d just been through. “The fact that it was four days was a big change for the Masters,” Dave said. “It’d always been three days in the past, so this year it was even more critical for me to monitor recovery. The last day I played it safe. It was some nice gymnastics bodyweight events like rope climbs and handstand pushups. I had a 50-point lead and wanted to make sure I didn’t crash and burn. I cruised to second and third-place finishes in those events.”
At the end of the day, Hippensteel was a two-time CrossFit Games champion, still the fittest 60-year-old on the planet.

“I felt I was able to time things perfectly in terms of utilizing WHOOP and the information it gave me about Recovery,” Dave said, “particularly in terms of being strategic about all the events over the four days. And it’s not just the exertion of the workouts, but also the pressure overnight. You have to be able to turn your brain off and get that sleep you need. It’s very reassuring to have that guide on your wrist 24/7 to give you the confidence that your body is primed to compete.

daylight-savings-sleep-recovery,How Daylight Savings Impacts Sleep & Recovery,"Spring is right around the corner, which means it’s time to adjust our clocks for Daylight Saving Time. And while many of us greatly enjoy the extra hour of light we get in the evenings before the sun sets, nobody likes initially losing that hour in the middle of the night while they’re sleeping.
But, just how much does that shortened Saturday-night-into-Sunday-morning actually affect us the next day?
The answer is not as much as you might expect. Here’s what we learned by studying the average sleep and recovery data of our members around Daylight Savings last year.
## Setting a Baseline
To determine a baseline, we first calculated the average sleep times and recoveries for WHOOP members over a span of several Saturday nights/Sunday mornings prior to Daylight Saving Time. Since most of the population tends to follow similar schedules from week to week and often has different sleep patterns on the weekends, it was important to only look at this particular night/day of the week.
Another factor we took into consideration was people beginning to sleep more while quarantining due to COVID-19. Our data shows this started to happen right after US Daylight Savings in 2020 (March 8). For this reason, we chose to only use sleeps and recoveries prior to that date.
## Sleep & Recovery Norms
We found that leading up to Daylight Saving Time last year, WHOOP members slept an average of 7:02 on Saturday nights, and woke up with an average recovery of 56.7% on Sunday mornings.
Did these numbers drop on the night we set the clocks forward an hour? Yes, but we didn’t actually “lose an hour of sleep”–not even close.
## Differences in Sleep & Recovery Following Daylight Savings
On the night of Saturday March 7, 2020, our members slept an average of 6:44, just 18 minutes less than the norm. The average Sunday morning recovery on March 8 was 55.7%, only 1% below baseline.",3/12/21
daylight-savings-sleep-recovery,How Daylight Savings Impacts Sleep & Recovery,"Impact of Time Change on Circadian Rhythm
Even though the immediate disruptions of Daylights Savings to WHOOP members’ baseline metrics are minimal, there are potential repercussions of the time change throwing off your circadian rhythm (your body’s 24-hour internal clock that regulates your sleep/wake cycle).
We took a deep dive into this subject on Episode 97 of our podcast last fall, How Daylight Savings Affects Your Body. The key takeaway is that with behaviors to improve your sleep consistency (going to bed and waking up at similar times each day) you can maximize the quality of your sleep, even if/when you can’t get all the sleep you need.

deep-sleep-vs-rem-sleep-what-are-the-differences,Deep Sleep vs. REM Sleep: What are the Differences?,"Deep sleep and REM sleep are both important stages in the sleep cycle, but they support your body and mind in distinct ways and have different identifying features. You can track how much Deep sleep vs. REM sleep you’re getting each night to better understand the quality of your sleep.
## Deep Sleep vs. REM Sleep
There is often confusion between deep sleep and REM sleep, despite their differences. Deep sleep, also known as the “physically restorative” stage of sleep, is when your muscles and tissues repair themselves while your cells regenerate. This stage is responsible for the production of 95% of human growth hormone. REM sleep, on the other hand, is the “mentally restorative” stage of sleep where your brain converts short-term memories into long-term ones. During REM sleep, your brain is highly active, hence the name “rapid eye movement”, and your heart rate and respiratory rate increase. This stage is also associated with experiencing vivid dreams.
## Deep Sleep Characteristics
Deep sleep is the second stage of sleep, after light sleep. Deep sleep is characterized by a slow, steady heart rate and slow respiratory rate. In deep sleep your heart rate may be 20-30% slower than your waking resting heart rate and your respiratory rate can slow as much as 15% compared to your normal waking breathing rate. Additionally, your body may move during this stage of sleep and your eyes turn upwards under their lids.
Brain waves are the slowest during deep sleep. This is the reason it’s also called slow wave sleep (SWS).
Deep sleep is the stage where the body restores itself physically. Blood flow increases to help repair muscles and bones, balance metabolism and blood sugar levels, and strengthen the immune system.
REM and deep sleep have distinct characteristics Including brainwaves, heart rate and respiratory rate.",12/15/21
deep-sleep-vs-rem-sleep-what-are-the-differences,Deep Sleep vs. REM Sleep: What are the Differences?,"Track How Much Sleep You’re Getting With WHOOP
Monitoring your sleep with WHOOP lets you see how much sleep you get on a nightly basis and how different variables affect your sleep. WHOOP tracks your sleep each night and breaks down precisely how much time you spend in each stage of sleep. The WHOOP app Sleep Planner recommends bed and wake times based on your personal circadian rhythm to help you maximize every stage of sleep.",12/15/21
deep-sleep-vs-rem-sleep-what-are-the-differences,Deep Sleep vs. REM Sleep: What are the Differences?,"REM Sleep Characteristics
Rapid eye movement or REM sleep is identified by movement of the eyes under their lids. This is the stage when you may experience vivid narrative dreams that can increase your heart rate and respiratory rate. Your body temperature may also fluctuate. Brain activity in REM sleep is similar to when you’re conscious.
During REM sleep your body becomes relaxed and immobile as your brain sends signals to the spinal cord to shut off movement. This creates temporary paralysis in the arms and legs, to avoid the body acting out your dreams. Sleepwalking may happen when this temporary paralysis is disrupted. Sleep apnea may also be worse during REM sleep because the muscles relax so much.
Sleep scientists believe REM sleep is involved in learning, storing memories, and balancing mood. It may heal and restore the brain similarly to the way deep sleep heals and restores the body, preparing both for the day to come. For athletes, it is involved in committing new technical skills to long-term memory.
## How Much REM Sleep and Deep Sleep Do You Need?
You normally enter deep sleep between 30 minutes and an hour after falling asleep. Your first period of deep sleep usually lasts 45-90 minutes, but time spent in deep sleep generally becomes shorter in the sleep cycles later in the night.
The first period of REM sleep usually occurs within 90 minutes of going to sleep. It usually lasts about 10 minutes and episodes get longer as the night processes.
The average adult goes through 3-5 full sleep cycles per night typically, totaling 1-2 hours of deep sleep and 90-120 minutes of REM sleep.",12/15/21

The WHOOP 4.0 development campaign included over 4,000 participants and 20,000 data sets. This enabled our signal processing team to refine and train our algorithms for our members by analyzing thousands of data sets from a range of participants engaging in various activities.
Early in 2020, we began testing unique configurations of our sensors using our 3.0 form factor. We were working out of WHOOP HQ as we aimed to narrow down our handmade prototypes with the strongest potential to be our WHOOP 4.0.
As COVID-19 became a prominent concern, WHOOP Labs adopted additional hygiene policies, started wearing masks and gloves, and socially distanced participants. Shortly after instating COVID-19 safety protocols, WHOOP Labs had to halt operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 15, 2020.

Pulling this off was no easy feat. In fact, we actually began working on WHOOP 4.0 back in 2018 and tested prototypes for 21 months in our Boston-based WHOOP Labs.
When it was all said and done, we successfully decreased the volume of WHOOP 4.0 by 33% while maintaining 5-day battery life, introduced wireless charging and a waterproof battery pack, increased modularity to allow wearability throughout the body as well as seamless swapping of bands, and also added SpO2 monitoring, skin temperature detection and a haptic alarm feature.
## Designing WHOOP 4.0
Using our previous datasets and benchtop analyses, we worked to align on configurations for the WHOOP 4.0 that had the most potential for improving accuracy in a smaller form factor. While doing this, we separated our production into two streams–sensor design and industrial design.
For our sensor design project, we began with the existing WHOOP 3.0 form factor and tested over two-dozen different sensor configurations. These prototypes were all handbuilt in house with the aim of identifying a configuration that allowed for increased accuracy across a wide range of conditions.
Our team also tried hundreds of different strap configurations, toying around with layout, size, lens height, slider style, and topography of the sensor as we worked to finalize our industrial design.",9/24/21
developing-4-0-product-validation-whoop-labs,Developing WHOOP 4.0: Product Validation in the WHOOP Labs,"Fit and Accuracy
After determining the locations and garments that deliver the highest quality data for our members, we went to work on confirming how those garments would fit our diverse membership base. As with the 3.0, the WHOOP 4.0 requires constant skin contact in order to produce the most accurate and reliable data. To do this with our WHOOP Body apparel requires all the garments to fit snugly–and because our members come in all shapes and sizes, the sizing and grading of our pieces needs to be dialed-in.
Over the course of thousands of wear tests and fittings, we optimized the sizing and grading rules of our garments to ensure that we were maximizing data collection. Having the right size garment is critical to data integrity, so it’s extremely important that when selecting WHOOP Body pieces our members utilize the size guide to choose what is right for them.
Launching WHOOP Body is a great way to give our members a choice in how they want to wear their 4.0.

Alongside the development and validation of WHOOP 4.0, our apparel team also began creating WHOOP Body featuring Any-Wear Technology. In tandem with the 4.0, we are proud to release a sports bra, legging, two styles of bralettes, a compression top, a performance boxer, and a cotton boxer, all of which enable you to wear WHOOP away from your wrist.
At the forefront of our minds throughout this process was the intent to make wearable technology truly wearable. The result was a technical line of apparel that suits our members’ lifestyles through intimates they can wear all day, and a training range that offers high-performance fabrications as well–all while creating an innovative product that allows the 4.0 to accurately pull raw data from a variety of places on the body. By decreasing the volume and increasing the modularity of WHOOP 4.0, it is easily detachable from the band to seamlessly slide into pods (small pockets that hold the sensor against your skin) in WHOOP Body garments.
Choosing which places on the body to insert the pods in our WHOOP Body garments was a creative process. We first used a thermal gun to see which areas on a person’s body had the most blood flow and would give the most accurate data readings for our members. From there, we decided to look at 20 different locations by sticking WHOOP 3.0s on test subjects and putting athletic tape over the straps to assess which ones worked best.
The WHOOP Labs team executed hundreds of studies and worked closely with our signal processing team to deduce which locations accurately collected data.

Once we had a grasp on the best places to collect data, the next step was to safety pin WHOOP 3.0s in our activewear and put them on participants. WHOOP Body went through several full garment revisions, with many versions of the pod we use to hold 4.0 securely in place, and also testing the pods in various spots within each piece of clothing.",9/24/21

WHOOP Labs was able to resume operations and welcome participants back into the Lab in July of 2020. At that time we opened our first WHOOP Labs location outside of the office, allowing us to safely conduct studies while socially distanced, masked, and following a strict sanitation and hygiene protocol.
We started to branch away from our general fitness studies and incorporate studies such as indoor spinning, yoga, indoor running, weightlifting, and functional fitness. The goal was to mimic activities that our members engage in to ensure that WHOOP 4.0 collects data accurately during various activities. Through this process, our team worked to narrow down which of the in-house, handmade prototype straps had the most potential.

doctor-explains-sleep-deprivation-hrv,Doctor Explains Sleep Deprivation and How it Affects HRV,"How Sleep Deprivation Impacts HRV
The consequences of sleep deprivation are systemic. One system most impacted is the cardiorespiratory system. In general, sleep deprivation leads to hyper-activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Sustained wakefulness elicits a global stress response that is sustained by the hypothalamic-pituitary-axis (HPA).
Because of this, heart rate variability decreases (Bourdillon et al. 2021). The sympathetic nervous system is activated longer leading to a decreased rate at which the parasympathetic is triggered.
Sleep deprivation also increases cortisol release which further promotes a global-wide systemic stress response. This is why chronic sleep deprivation as measured by WHOOP leads to an overall reduction in HRV and a poorer recovery.
To conclude, sleep deprivation is not what the cool kids are doing. Sometimes, it is unavoidable but there are plenty of holistic hacks to mitigate it. Check out my appearance on the WHOOP Podcast to learn more!

doctor-explains-sleep-deprivation-hrv,Doctor Explains Sleep Deprivation and How it Affects HRV,"Athletes and everyday heroes recognize that sleep deprivation is unavoidable. Certain athletic circles such as swimming and rowing embrace the pre-dawn training practices. The military and medicine use sleep deprivation during training and residency as a selection tool. Successful businesses embrace late night “brainstorming” sessions to move the needle forward.
But, there’s a difference between acute sleep deprivation and chronic sleep deprivation. The former can be mitigated while the latter has significant consequences. In recent years, the NCAA and US Olympic Committees have assembled sleep task forces that I have been fortunate enough to be a part of that are designed to mitigate the physical, cognitive, and interpersonal consequences of sleep deprivation.
## What is Sleep Deprivation? Acute vs Chronic
First, what is the difference between acute and chronic sleep deprivation?
Acute sleep deprivation is a single bout of sustained wakefulness separated by a period of rest. An example would be a student pulling an all nighter or a soldier doing a night watch.
Chronic sleep deprivation is more complex and more pervasive. Chronic sleep deprivation as defined by those of us in leadership positions with the Sleep Research Society (Luyster et al. 2012) is achieving less than 70% of daily sleep needs for at least 3 consecutive days.
An example would be a firefighter doing 16-hour shifts for 3-4 days followed by a few days of rest. Ultimately, chronic sleep deprivation requires a dire need for recovery sleep of a 2:1 ratio (2 hours of additional sleep for every hour lost) in order to protect against one of several cardio metabolic, neurobehavioral, and catabolic consequences of chronic sleep deprivation which we have extensively reported on (Good et al. 2020).

There are several ways that athletes experience both types of sleep deprivation. In light of this, this is why tactical napping and having disciplined bedtime and rise-time routines are important.
### 1. Early morning practice
1. Early morning practice
Rowers and swimmers are very familiar with this cultural norm. Early mornings require early bedtimes but, this can be extremely challenging for collegiate athletes; not just because of school but also because the body is biologically programmed to go to bed later and wake up later across adolescence and early adulthood (Crowley et al. 2007).
### 2. Late night games
2. Late night games
Football (American and European) and hockey players definitely know this struggle. A few years ago, we did a longitudinal assessment of sleep/wake patterns of a Division I football program across the season. We found that late-night games, practices, and bedtimes in general got progressively later across the season (Burke et al. 2020).
### 3. Performance-related
3. Performance-related
I recently helped to write what will soon be the first textbooks on sleep health in athletes. No matter the level of eliteness, athletes get nervous! In fact, if you aren’t nervous, then are you really trying or do you really care? This is why a good night of sleep two days prior to the start of competition is most important. Most athletes don’t sleep well the night before.
### 4. Training-related

doctors-heart-rate-saving-life-stress-icu,A Doctor's Heart Rate While Saving a Life & Combating Stress in the Intensive Care Unit,"Quantifying the Stress of Medical Training
My next question was: Can we utilize this strategy to determine the stress of medical training on a larger scale? Could we determine when and where the stress on trainees was the greatest, and hope to find ways to improve stress levels during these times? What else can we learn about cumulative stress on the body and its effects on physiologic metrics such as heart rate variability, resting heart rate, REM sleep and deep sleep?
I slept on this idea. And by slept, I really mean “slept,” as it was more of a nap. After leaving the hospital I went to the gym to blow off some steam from the evening’s events. I got to bed a little after 1:00 am and was up a few hours later to be back in the ICU by 6:00 am.
Not surprisingly, my WHOOP recovery was 20% and my sleep duration was suboptimal as well. Regardless, I was there to work hard the next day and give it my all, something that I strive to do every day, no matter what. This is part of the grind of residency.
A few weeks later, near the end of the month-long stint in the ICU, I was looking at my WHOOP data and noticed some interesting trends. My sleep duration and restorative sleep (REM and deep sleep) were some of the lowest they’d been in 3 years. I’d averaged 4 hours and 58 minutes of sleep per night for the past 30 days, with just 1:08 of REM and 1:01 of deep sleep. Those restorative sleep numbers were roughly half of my averages throughout residency.
My heart rate variability, a marker of not only physical but also mental and emotional stress on the body, was also at an all-time low for a 30-day stretch (47) and my average resting heart rate was up significantly.

doctors-heart-rate-saving-life-stress-icu,A Doctor's Heart Rate While Saving a Life & Combating Stress in the Intensive Care Unit,"a Study to Measure Resident Wellness & Prevent Burnout
I proposed this idea to one of my mentors (and one of the assistant program directors of our Internal Medicine residency program), Andrew Tinsley, and showed him the data that I had pulled together through 18 months of residency. It suggested some moderate correlations between work hours, HRV, RHR, and sleep. My other takeaway from the graph was how I needed to sleep more and work on improving my recoveries by optimizing HRV and RHR.
Fast-forward several months, and we were able to make this idea a reality, and now are approaching the half-way mark of the 12-month study using WHOOP to track resident wellness and burnout. I look back on how far we have come, and although there is much work to be done to make changes in medical/residency training, I believe we are on the right track to make improvements.
Nowadays, I am more focused than ever on how to make small changes in my daily habits to improve how I feel on a regular basis, as this directly translates to better performance in the hospital or outpatient setting. We have seen a close association between how people feel, how they perceive stress that they are under, and their physiologic metrics. Notably, our preliminary data shows tight correlations between increasing total sleep duration, REM and deep sleep, and improving physician wellness.
Although work hours might be a constant (bordering on 80 hours per week, or more, sometimes), there are other ways to stay healthy and it is still possible to thrive even in difficult circumstances. Hydration, stress reduction techniques (mindfulness, journaling, breathing exercises), sleep optimization strategies (sleep masks, blackout curtains, weighted blankets, no screens in bed), mitigation of unnecessary caffeine use, amongst other things, all seem to improve recovery.",12/11/20

The patient was already intubated (breathing tube in place to control breathing, on a ventilator). Next, his blood pressure dropped. We adjusted his medications, but there was little effect. He was nearly on every “pressor” (medications that help clamp down the blood vessels in order to increase blood pressure) we had. We increased them as high as they would go. No improvement. His heart rate soon doubled, and we prepared to shock him again. It worked. Things were briefly stable, but without identifying and treating the underlying cause, they would not stay like that for long.
Five minutes later, we lost pulses again. An unorganized rhythm was present on the monitor, but it was one that would not respond to another cardioversion (shock). Chest compressions were started again, and epinephrine was given at scheduled intervals – we call this “coding” a patient – performing CPR and giving certain medications based on Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) algorithms.
After 3 rounds of CPR, we re-established a pulse. He was back. The situation had finally settled down, and it stayed that way. Everyone was elated. Soon, the family was able to spend time with their father/husband/brother in a stable setting. The code was successful.

Afterwards I sat down and decompressed, recounting everything as we documented the sequence of events. The ICU team had a huddle and discussed what aspects went well, and where we could improve – a critical and undervalued part of training – asking the hard questions like “How can we do this even better?”
Everyone had something to learn, and we all walked away better than when they started. Medicine truly is a career filled with life-long learning, and experiences such as this one can really shape your outlook. I was humbled that we could come together and save this man’s life, and always will be.
## My Own Elevated Heart Rate
As I was walking out of the hospital, I received a notification on my phone from WHOOP: “Your activity is ready for review.” This was odd, as I clearly had not been at the gym, nor had I been physically exerting myself. But when I opened up the app and looked at my heart rate during this “activity,” I was quite shocked at what I saw:
I’d spent 57 minutes at an average heart rate of 143, with a max heart rate of 173. It looked just like I was working out, but I wasn’t. To recap, I had not been doing chest compressions or any actual physical or strenuous activity, aside from standing at the bedside of the patient and running the code. However, it was clear that my heart rate was quite responsive to the elevated stress in the moment.
This really got the wheels in my brain turning… In medicine, stressful times like these are more common than not, and it is clear that remote monitoring of physiologic metrics could capture this stress in real time (seen here by heart rate elevation in a high-stress scenario).",12/11/20
doctors-heart-rate-saving-life-stress-icu,A Doctor's Heart Rate While Saving a Life & Combating Stress in the Intensive Care Unit,"It Started with a Heart Rate Spike…
The elevated heart rate was consistent with a rhythm that we call atrial fibrillation, and sometimes this fast heart rate can cause blood pressure to drop (as there is not enough time for the heart to adequately fill to eject enough blood to support the body). Fortunately, the rate spontaneously normalized, but only transiently. Soon the monitor showed rates into the 200s and blood pressure was rapidly dropping.
We “shocked” the patient (synchronized cardioversion) to try to break the abnormal rhythm, to no avail. He then lost pulses and the rhythm was no longer shockable, therefore chest compressions were initiated. After two rounds of CPR and pushing epinephrine, we got him back.
The room was calm. The teamwork was flawless. Everyone was performing their tasks swiftly, and without hesitation. Things were stable, but we were not out of the woods. It was unclear what led to this acute change.
We went back to the drawing board. What brought him into the hospital in the first place? What workup had been done? What could we be missing? It was a very complex case, with multiple consultants giving their input, yet no one could pinpoint an issue. The cardiology team, hematology/oncology team, infectious disease team, and ICU team were going back and forth on all the potential causes. We were stumped.
Being the senior resident in the ICU, I led the discussions with the family in the waiting room to review everything that happened, everything that we knew, and everything that we were doing. They were grateful for all of the care from everyone – the nurses, respiratory therapists, social workers, residents, fellows, and attendings. It really was a team effort.

In reality the only variable that was added to the equation was the additional stress of being in the ICU work environment.

does-exercise-help-period-cramps-faqs-about-menstruation,Does Exercise Help Period Cramps? FAQs About Menstruation,"Low motivation often comes from fluctuations in hormone levels in the luteal stage of your cycle as estrogen and progesterone levels begin to fall. These hormones affect neurotransmitters including serotonin and dopamine, which influence mood, motivation, and sleep. You might feel sad or anxious, irritable, or lack motivation. Levels of all four hormones begin rising again after the onset of your period, but it may take a few days before you begin feeling better.
But, while you might not be motivated to work out during your period, there are benefits to doing so.
Your body is prepared to work harder during your period than at any other time during your cycle. Additionally, you can gain more muscle mass and burn more fat than usual during this time of month. You may also feel more recovered the next day after a hard workout during your period.
If you’re not feeling motivated to try your full workout routine, Dr. Stacy Sims suggests trying short bursts of interval training.
“Something like 20 seconds all out 5-8 times with 2 minutes’ cruise between, then call it. The super-intense work will increase post-exercise anti-inflammatory responses, release endorphins, and because it is short, it is not as taxing mentally or physically as doing a full structured workout.”

FAQs About Menstruation,"When you enter perimenopause (the transition stage before menopause), the most important thing is to track your symptoms, your sleep, and how you’re feeling. Sims suggests changing your workouts to a three-week program. She recommends two weeks of intense training such as HIIT and heavy weight lifting, and one week of low-intensity aerobic work.
For those past menopause, drop the long slow jogs and work on sprint intervals, HIIT, and heavy resistance training. In post-menopausal people anaerobic training helps to control blood sugar and build lean muscle.
Does birth control affect performance? If so, how?
Birth control hormones have a systemic effect on your physiology. Oral contraceptives are associated with a decrease in the amount of oxygen you can use during exercise (VO2 max peak) and a decreased ability to adapt to high-intensity training, according to Sims. The same effect has not been found with other types of birth control such as intrauterine devices.
Can exercise cause you to lose your period?
Hypothalamic amenorrhea, or the halting of your menstrual cycle, happens when you’re not consuming enough calories to support your normal activities and training.
Your body responds by halting production of hormones involved in the menstrual cycle, which reduces ovulation and eventually leads to a lost cycle. The first step to getting your period back is to talk to your doctor.
Do you get weaker on your period?
The opposite is true! This study found that strength training during the follicular phase (from your period to ovulation) results in greater increases in muscle strength than during the luteal phase (between ovulation and your period).

But many of us, regardless of age, still have questions we’re uncomfortable asking about periods, menopause, and how to fit exercise into our cycles. We’ve gathered the most popular questions WHOOP members ask us and answered them in one spot.
Does exercise reduce period cramps?
Yes! Working out during your period can relieve cramps, boost your mood, and reduce other symptoms by releasing endorphins which block pain receptors in your brain.
Aerobic exercise such as running, or even a brisk walk, helps reduce the inflammation that causes cramps and can release enough endorphins to provide some relief. Regular exercise also increases blood flow to your uterus, which can cramp so hard that it cuts off blood flow, sending pain signals to the brain.
What should I be doing to fight fatigue during my period?
Periods can come with unwanted symptoms and feeling tired is one of them. Fatigue is caused when levels of hormones including estrogen, progesterone, and serotonin decrease after ovulation during the late luteal stage or your period. Low hormones can lead to inflammation, feeling sad or anxious, poor sleep, and decreased energy levels. Estrogen levels continue to be low through menstruation and can leave you feeling tired.
In addition, very heavy periods may lead to iron deficiency, which can also cause fatigue.
Taking omega 3 fatty acids, magnesium, or zinc supplements may help counter the symptoms. Your doctor can also order a blood test to see if you have an iron deficiency, and then prescribe an iron supplement if you do.
The menstrual cycle has two phases: follicular and luteal. Ovulation separates the follicular and luteal phases and Menstruation denotes the beginning of the follicular phase.

For the most part, it is generally considered safe to take melatonin on a nightly basis in the short term. According to the National Institutes of Health, it is unclear what side effects long-term use of melatonin may have. As with any drug or supplement, you may also find melatonin to be less effective for you if you come to rely on it too heavily.
Recommended doses for melatonin are quite low, often 1 milligram or less. Potential side effects of too much melatonin include dizziness, headaches, nausea, diarrhea, joint pain, anxiety, and irritability. You may want to consult your doctor about how melatonin can interact with any medications you are taking or medical conditions you might have.
## Track What Melatonin Does For You with WHOOP
The WHOOP Journal feature allows you to track when you take melatonin before bed (and the dosage), as well as a great variety of other choices and behaviors that can impact your sleep.

We break down its effects on WHOOP sleep and recovery data, as well as discuss the basics of what melatonin is, how it works, when to take it, and its potential side effects.
## What Is Melatonin?
Often referred to as the “sleep hormone,” melatonin is produced naturally in a part of the brain called the pineal gland. Its purpose is to aid the regulation of your sleep cycle and circadian rhythm. Your melatonin levels are normally linked to the amount of light around you. When the sun goes down, the pineal gland begins releasing more melatonin to let your body know it’s time to go to sleep. In the morning melatonin production slows down, helping you to wake up.
Melatonin is generally available as an over-the-counter supplement, typically a tablet or capsule that you take orally. The majority of melatonin supplements are made synthetically in a lab.
## How Does Melatonin Help You Sleep?
Studies estimate that about 33% of adults worldwide may suffer from insomnia. And while most people’s bodies generate sufficient amounts of the hormone on their own, taking additional melatonin supplements can be useful for many of us who struggle to fall asleep.
As noted on Episode 14 of the WHOOP Podcast, although taking melatonin before bed won’t help you stay asleep, it is often beneficial in enabling you to fall asleep faster in the first place.
Melatonin itself does not actually put you to sleep, it simply alerts your body to the fact that it’s nighttime so it can get to sleep more easily. It does this by binding with receptors in your body and brain to better allow you to relax, and decrease nerve activity. Melatonin may also reduce your levels of dopamine, a hormone associated with wakefulness.",11/12/21

To better quantify the benefits of melatonin, we examined WHOOP members’ sleep and recovery data when they report taking it. What we discovered makes a fairly convincing case that it can have a positive effect on your sleep.
On average, WHOOP members get 34 more minutes of sleep each night when they take melatonin. They also average 2% more REM sleep (the mentally restorative stage of sleep) and wake up the next day with an 11% higher recovery.
On average, taking melatonin positively affects WHOOP members’ sleep and recovery.
Potential confounding factors were taken into account as well, meaning our analysis controlled for other sleep-promoting behaviors (like blue-light blocking glasses, an eye mask, or reading before bed, for example) that you might also try when taking melatonin.
Overall we found these numbers were consistent for both men and women, however the benefits of melatonin on both sleep time and recovery diminished with age.",11/12/21
drew-manning-fit-to-fat-to-fit,Fit to Fat to Fit: What I See in the Data,"The Fit to Fat to Fit Experiment
So to make a long story short, I decided to go on a journey and gain weight for 6 months, then walk the walk and lose it all over the course of the next 6 months. That meant no exercising for the first 6 months and a diet full of the Standard American Diet foods (white bread, white pasta, sugary cereals, sodas, granola bars, chips, cookies, crackers, frozen meals, mac n cheese, hot pockets, spaghetti o’s, top ramen, etc).
I ended up adding on 75 pounds in 6 months, but more importantly I gained a new outlook. I realized just how wrong I was in trying to help my clients with their meal plans, workouts, macros, calories, supplements, etc, when in reality they needed help more so on the mental and emotional side of transformation.
The other main lesson I discovered was how powerful the emotional connection to food really is. I used to think it was just a lack of willpower and discipline until I undertook this journey. It was a huge struggle and I was surprised at how hard my own body fought against me to go after those cravings I was experiencing. My eyes were truly opened and this is where I started to develop empathy instead of judgment for those that struggle with their weight, or transformation in general.
Luckily I was able to lose the weight and get back to my original body, but with a new understanding of the mental and emotional side of things. From there I wrote my first book, called Fit2Fat2Fit, which became a NY Times Best Seller, and created my own TV show on A&E called Fit To Fat To Fit.",11/25/20
drew-manning-fit-to-fat-to-fit,Fit to Fat to Fit: What I See in the Data,"Data Insights From the First Part of My Journey: HRV, Resting Heart Rate & More
One of the interesting things I’ve noticed so far while gaining weight is my lack of sleep, and that is showing up pretty clearly in my WHOOP data. Previously my recovery scores were generally anywhere from 75-95% (green) on average, but since I’ve started my journey they have dropped significantly to closer to 30-40%. My HRV (heart rate variability) was usually around 100, which led to really good recovery. Now, my average is somewhere around 50 or so.
weight gain has had a significant negative impact on both HRV and resting heart rate.
All of this data can help show people how living an unhealthy lifestyle and eating processed food can impact our mental and emotional capacity to handle other stresses in our lives, like kids, finances, relationships, business relationships and more.
When we are sleep deprived we are in a constant state of “survival mode,” which then causes us to have a shorter fuse when dealing with stressful situations. This can cause us to be more reactive, less patient, grumpy, moody and irritable. It can also throw off our hormones and, for men, lower our testosterone, which leads to lower sex drive and other unpleasant side effects.
This is why it’s so important for me to capture all of this data and help people become more aware and make these valuable connections to improve our overall health, not just physical health.
## The Road Back
I’m inviting everyone to join me on my journey back to fit and to learn how to overcome these mental and emotional challenges as well, starting January 4, 2021. I’ll hold your hand each step of the way and help with the physical, mental and emotional aspects of weight-loss transformation.

I’m currently on my second Fit2Fat2Fit experiment, but this time it’s different. It’s about me trying to spread the message of empathy and the need for more of it in the fitness industry in particular, which is an industry that lacks empathy in my opinion. My hope is to bring awareness to this and to the importance of the mental and emotional side of transformation, which is not as easy as some people think it is.
Plus, I’m turning 40 this year and decided to do it again to give people this age some hope that we can take care of our health even if it’s harder as we get older (with our hormones and metabolism changing).

I want to make it more educational so people become more aware of just how living an unhealthy lifestyle can affect you in so many other ways besides simply gaining weight–mentally, emotionally, sexual health, finances, motivation, handling stress, relationships, memory, etc.

drew-manning-fit-to-fat-to-fit,Fit to Fat to Fit: What I See in the Data,"Back in 2011 I had this wild idea to get fat on purpose. It sounds crazy, right? Well it was!
Before I get to it though, here’s a little background about me. I grew up in a family of 11 brothers and sisters (I was number 7). I played sports from the time I was a little kid, in particular football and wrestling. Because of that, I was always in good shape. I almost always had a six pack and was never overweight. I wasn’t someone who ever experienced food cravings or ate emotionally. For me, being in shape came pretty easily and that’s all I ever knew.
Fast forward to 2009 when I became a trainer. Here I was, someone who’d never been overweight a day in his life, trying to help many people who were overweight much of their lives. Obviously I couldn’t comprehend why it was so hard for them to stay consistent with meal plans and workouts, because for me it had always been so easy.
One day a client told me that I just didn’t understand what it was like for him and for people like him. I took that to heart, and immediately started thinking of ways I could gain a new perspective and better relate to my clients.
Then, like a light bulb going off in my head, this idea of getting fat on purpose and documenting it entered my mind. Almost immediately I felt like I was being called to do this.",11/25/20
drew-manning-fit-to-fat-to-fit-weight-loss,"Drew Manning AMA: Diet, Workouts & Losing Weight at 40","DREW: I do agree that yo-yo dieting is not good for the body.

It’s not harder to lose the weight necessarily, but it probably means that it’s easier to gain the weight back so I have to be extra careful to stay on top of being consistent in my approach to staying fit.
Q: Is weight loss as simply as eating less and working out more?
DREW: I wish it was that simple. Yes, it’s simple in theory, but HARD for most people in the application of it. The law of thermodynamics will always be applicable, but we are humans and there is a psychological component to physical transformation that is always overlooked. The emotional connection to food is more powerful than we think and a lot of food addiction is tied to trauma/stresses of life, which is why it’s not as simple as just “eating less/working out more.” This is why I’m trying to bring change to the fitness industry by leading with empathy first.",6/17/21

Q: What do you do about loose skin left over from previous weight gain?
DREW: That’s a personal question that depends on the individual’s situation. If you don’t like it, luckily we live in a world where there are options to fix that if that’s what you want to do, or you can embrace and learn to love it no matter what society thinks. I always recommend getting down to an ideal body fat percentage first and then see what that loose skin looks like at that ideal body fat. Then from there make a choice of what you want to do, but that’s up to the individual.
## Weight gain
Q: What was your diet/lifestyle to gain weight?
DREW: Lots of processed foods! Sugary cereals, pop tarts, breakfast bars, bagels, waffles, frozen burritos, peanut butter sandwiches, granola bars, chips, cookies, crackers, croissants, Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, sodas, juices, beer, and other alcohol! I also did NOT exercise for the entire 4 months.
## Tips to shed the last few pounds
Q: What should you focus on to lose the last 3 pounds?
DREW: The biggest hurdle is the mental discipline needed to be consistent with exercise (maybe also increase the intensity/volume of your workouts too), and then making sure your calories/macros are where they should be.
## Sleep
Q: How much does proper/improper sleep affect the weight loss process?
DREW: Sleep plays an important role in hormone optimization. So if you’re not sleeping well through the night because of your diet/lack of exercise it most likely will affect your ability to lose weight efficiently. If you’re sleeping well through the night because of a healthy diet and exercise then it definitely can aid in helping you lose weight more efficiently.",6/17/21

Q: What are your thoughts on fasted versus fed cardio?
DREW: I like to consider this splitting hairs, but if I had to choose I would go with fasted cardio mostly because I feel better doing cardio on an empty stomach. Does it help you burn more fat? I’m not so sure, but I know a lot of people swear by it. I think it totally depends on the person and their lifestyle and their goals.
Q: How much emphasis did you put on cardio versus weight training along your journey?
DREW: I lifted 3 days per week and did HIIT cardio two days per week.
Check out Drew’s episode of the WHOOP podcast.
## Metabolism
Q: How do you diet without slowing your metabolism?
DREW: Being in a calorie deficit for too long definitely can slow down your metabolism. Scheduling some refeeds can help out with that. Now that my Back2Fit is over though, I’ve been in a calorie surplus and am focusing on lifting heavy. Something I think is important for everyone who wants to lose weight and fat in the long term is to schedule some hypertrophy (muscle growth) phases.
## Snacking and fasting
Q: I love to snack before bedtime even though every diet book says not to. Is there a particular time that you stop eating before going to bed? If so, why that time and any tips for us late night snackers?
DREW: I usually use intermittent fasting, which allows you to have an eating window of 8 hours or so and you can eat in that eating window. So if you’re eating from noon to 8 pm you can essentially eat all the way up until 8 pm. Or you can switch it to 1 pm to 9 pm if that works too, but eating right before bed isn’t always optimal for sleep honestly. So I usually stop eating around 2 hours before bed.
## Supplements
Q: What supplements would you say are essential while dropping weight?

Q: Have your heart rate variability and resting heart rate gone back to your pre weight gain levels?
DREW: Yes they have! The body is pretty resilient and can bounce back pretty quickly if you treat it right consistently.
Q: How did your HRV change when losing the weight?
DREW: My HRV score was around 100 when I started and then dropped to the low 40s during my weight gain phase. Then when I was losing weight again it slowly creeped back up to the 70s+!
## Diet, calories and macros
Q: What was your diet like when losing the weight?
DREW: I followed mostly a ketogenic diet, but with higher protein. And then I would cycle in some high carb days after being strict for 2 months or so.
Q: When losing weight, specifically trying to maintain muscle and lose fat, did you follow any specific macro ratios? If so, do you find a benefit in counting macros and not just calories?
DREW: Yes, for the most part I did a keto-ish approach most of the time. So 65% fat, 30% protein and 5% carbs. I did some carb cycling during my journey and also did some targeted keto protocols. I do think there are benefits to tracking macros instead of calories. Protein is the most important, in my opinion, for maintaining lean muscle mass and losing fat mass. I just don’t track macros forever though. I think it’s good to become familiar with it and know how it works, but to count calories and macros for the rest of your life seems exhausting to me.
Q: What is a healthy macro ratio while losing weight?
DREW: It’s different for each person so I can’t really answer this one specifically. The key is to get an adequate amount of protein (maybe 1 gram for every pound of lean mass), and then whether you use carbs or fats just make sure your calories are low enough that you’re in a caloric deficit.",6/17/21

Q: I just lost 50 pounds last year, and with the world reopening slowly, I gained back about 10 of those pounds, and it’s been tougher to lose it back than last year.

What tips do you have?
DREW: What worked for you in the past doesn’t always work for you in the present. This is why it’s so important to look into new protocols that challenge your body to adapt to a new environment. So switching up your workouts, the intensity of your workouts, the volume of your workouts, your diet, your macros are all good things to explore. Think of yourself as your own self experiment and give yourself 30-60 days to allow time for your body to adapt.

The Blue Devils have also qualified for the NCAA Tournament in 22 consecutive seasons. In fact, they’ve missed the “big dance” just once in the past 34 years, in 1995 when a back injury forced Krzyzewski to step away from the team after 12 games.
Krzyzewski, who’s been part of Team USA since 1979 and is already a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, enters his 38th season with the school as the winningest coach in Division 1 men’s basketball history. Not showing any signs of slowing down, his 2017-18 roster looks as strong as ever.
Gone are the days when seniors like Dawkins, Ferry and Laettner dominated college basketball. The “one and done” phenomenon has taken over, with the best players heading to the NBA after their freshman seasons. The game has changed, and the Blue Devils have adapted.
Duke, which finished the 2016-17 regular season ranked seventh nationally, has four of the top eight incoming freshman in the country.
And if that wasn’t already enough to give the Blue Devils a serious leg up on the competition, now they have a technological edge as well–they’re wearing WHOOP.

By his sixth season, Krzyzewski had the Blue Devils in the national championship game. Duke fell to Louisville, but Devils senior Johnny Dawkins was the 1986 tournament’s leading scorer.
Two years later, junior center Danny Ferry led Duke back to the Final Four in 1988, where it lost to eventual champion Kansas. As a senior, Ferry scored a conference record 58 points in a regular season victory over Miami. Ferry’s Devils again reached the national semifinals in 1989.
The 1990 Duke squad featured senior Alaa Abdelnaby, sophomore center Christian Laettner and freshman point guard Bobby Hurley. This edition made it all the way to the championship game before succumbing the University of Nevada Las Vegas Runnin’ Rebels.
Duke got its revenge on UNLV the following year, upsetting the undefeated Rebels (34-0) in the 1991 semis on the way to capturing the school’s first national title in men’s basketball. Laettner was named tournament MVP, but the most memorable moment was this absurd alley-oop pass and dunk from Hurley to freshman forward Grant Hill:
In 1992, a loaded Blue Devils club trailed Rick Pitino’s Kentucky Wildcats 103-102 with 2.1 seconds remaining in overtime of the East Regional Final.

Below we’ll discuss how eating before sleep impacts your body, and examine the effects it has on WHOOP member data.
## Common Belief About Eating Before Bed and Gaining Weight
The standard assumption people often make is that eating prior to going to sleep will cause you to gain weight, with the reason being that your metabolism slows down when you are sleeping. In turn, this will lead to the calories you’ve consumed being stored as fat.
However, most scientific evidence doesn’t actually support this line of thinking. While there may often be a connection between late-night snacking and putting on weight, the more likely explanation is simply that you’re consuming more calories in total by eating extra food before bedtime.

The results we uncovered make a solid case that eating late is likely detrimental to your sleep. On average, when our members report eating close to bedtime they get 26 fewer minutes of sleep than they usually do. They also average 3% less REM sleep (the mentally restorative stage of sleep) than normal.
On top of that, next-day recovery dips by an average of 10% following late-night eating.
eating close to bedtime negatively impacts WHOOP Members’ sleep & recovery.
Our analysis took potential confounding factors into account as well, controlling for other behaviors (like drinking alcohol) that you might also engage in when eating late.
## How Long Before Bed Should You Stop Eating?
What time do you need to eat dinner in order to avoid the likelihood of it hurting your sleep? WHOOP VP of Performance Science Kristen Holmes recommends having your final meal of the day at least 2-3 hours before you plan to go to bed.
Beyond eating early, it’s also quite beneficial to stick to a regular dinner time as best you can. Your body functions better when it runs on a predictable schedule. Consistent meal times enforce this and help regulate your circadian rhythm, which improves the efficiency of your sleep.
## Best Foods to Eat Before Bed
If you find yourself hungry before bed, some foods are a much better choice than others. Dairy products can be sleep promoting, and foods with serotonin also prompt your body to produce the sleep hormone melatonin.
Tart cherry juice is high in melatonin itself and is a popular sleep aid, but that’s not going to do much to curb your appetite. A few simple carbs before bed (pasta, white rice, potatoes) may be a decent option, since they are easier to digest than complex ones. And if you’re feeling ambitious, try mixing up this sleep cocktail.
Foods to avoid before bed include anything high in fat or sugar, which require a lot of hard work for your body to process.
RELATED:",10/23/21
eating-before-bed-affects-sleep-recovery,How Eating Before Bed Affects Your Sleep and Recovery,"Why Is It Bad to Eat Before Bed? IT Affects Your Sleep
At the most basic level, if your body is working to digest food it’s not able to get to as restful a state as it would otherwise. This can cause you to have trouble falling asleep and also reduce the quality of your sleep.
From performance chef Dan Churchill on the WHOOP Podcast:
“Your body doesn’t switch off when it’s digesting at nighttime. So all of a sudden if you look at your WHOOP and it tells you that you’re waking up, [having bad sleep] latency, all that kind of stuff. … Part of the reason your mind might not switch off [while trying to sleep] is because of that connection between your gut and your brain. Your gut is not switching off because it’s digesting food in a way that’s not efficient and your brain, in response, is trying to work out what’s going on so you don’t fall asleep properly.”
The process of digestion may also divert resources away from other restorative aspects of sleep which help your body recover. Additionally, eating late can throw off your circadian rhythm, the body’s 24-hour internal clock that regulates your sleep/wake cycle (more on this to follow).
## Self Experimentation & Tracking Eating Before Bed with WHOOP
With the WHOOP Journal feature, one of the many behaviors our members can track each day is whether or not they ate any food close to bedtime (as well as the specific time they ate). WHOOP then provides them with insights into how this behavior affects their physiological metrics.
Byan Johnson, CEO of Kernel, took this analysis to an unprecedented level. Through countless hours of self experimentation, he determined that any food he ate after 10 am caused his resting heart rate to increase that night. Bryan now fasts for most of the day prior to going to sleep, and eats his dinner at 10 in the morning.
While Bryan’s example is obviously very extreme, we decided to examine the data of our members to see what happens when they log eating before sleep.",10/23/21
eating-disorder-recovery-sleep,How Under-Eating Can Impact WHOOP Data: Insight into My Eating Disorder and Recovery,"As a survivor of anorexia, I now realize how much my WHOOP metrics would have helped me when I was in the midst of it. For a girl who never thought she’d be able to listen to her body, my WHOOP membership has proven to be priceless.
My life before was one where I really thought I was doing my best to be healthy. With society (and other wearables) focusing on tracking calories, meals and steps, it can be easy to spiral into an unhealthy relationship with food and exercise.
This was my world, disguised under the veil of “health.” Under that veil was a person very far from actually being healthy; a person consumed by diet culture and one that didn’t know how to stop focusing on weight and start focusing on real health.
## Why WHOOP Differs from Other Fitness Trackers
WHOOP isn’t like those other wearables. There is no focus on “daily steps” or calorie tracking, and a very obvious emphasis on recovery. Although I got my WHOOP after going through a very long and emotionally grueling process of ED recovery, my WHOOP data still gives me so much information about what I was doing to my body back in my worst days of struggling with balancing fitness and true health.
Back then, I didn’t have anything to tell me how much stress I put my body under by under-fueling and overexercising every single day. WHOOP shows me exactly how much strain I take on now, even when I don’t particularly feel stressed.
## My Worst WHOOP Recovery
There have been a few days where, purely due to circumstance, I didn’t eat enough for my body to recover and the implications were reflected in my WHOOP data the next day. Here is the data from one of those days:
For context, I didn’t push my workout like I used to, so my food intake mimicked a true independent variable. I also did my regular nightly stretch that usually heightens my recovery, and spent close to 8 hours in bed. My low sleep time that night (only 5:45) was actually an expected surprise, if that makes sense. I’ll explain more below.",5/7/21

For comparison, here is my data from a high-recovery morning where I made sure to eat plenty of food the day before and kept everything else basically the same:
Not only did this open my eyes to the physical and emotional stress I put my body through during my ED, it also made me realize how useful of a tool WHOOP can be for the recovery community.
To elaborate on what I mentioned before, many other wearables have a connection to perpetuating unhealthy eating and exercise behaviors in someone with an eating disorder by emphasizing ‘daily steps’ and calorie burns, and not focusing on the corresponding impact of strain on the body. The reason WHOOP feels different for me than other fitness trackers is because it instead prioritizes recovery and sleep. That helps me eliminate the guilt that came with resting during my ED, and not feeling like I constantly had to keep moving and adding more ‘steps’ to my day.",5/7/21
eating-disorder-recovery-sleep,How Under-Eating Can Impact WHOOP Data: Insight into My Eating Disorder and Recovery,"WHOOP Data Knowledge Could’ve Helped Combat My Eating Disorder
The WHOOP strain and HRV would have been perfect metrics to make me realize the implications of my overtraining, as reflected in my recovery scores. These metrics serve as powerful data points to someone whose mind is skewed in the extreme; a mind that makes them genuinely feel like they constantly need to do more and eat less.
These realizations apply not only to people who are suffering or have suffered from eating disorders, but also to anyone who has the tendency to fall prey to diet culture and a very extreme mindset with exercise.
When I was at my worst, I truly believed that exercising for 90 minutes a day, not taking extra rest days when I was sick, injured or tired, and eating way too little was just me making sacrifices to be “fit” and “healthy.” In reality, I was ironically pushing myself further and further away from an actual healthy body.
I know I was not alone in feeling this way about food and exercise, and I wish I had my WHOOP to show me that my actions did not align with my goals. I believe it could have helped in preventing me from developing an eating disorder, and offered evidence that I was on the right path during my recovery. This might have saved me from years of grief, physical pain, and emotional distress in recovering.

When I was in the worst stages of my eating disorder, I woke up quite often with hunger pangs through the night, and understandably so. This had a very direct correlation with how much sleep I’d lose, since my body was focused on acquiring more food.
Additionally, I woke up at least 3-4 times to pee, which was a symptom of extremely low estrogen. This also contributed to loss of sleep. Finally, despite struggling to fall asleep (which is tracked by WHOOP as “sleep latency”) and losing even more sleep throughout the night, I consistently woke up at 7 am every single morning, whether I went to bed at 10 pm or 2 am.
My recent WHOOP data shown above emulates all of this in an eerily perfect way. That night, I remember waking up twice to pee, and hunger pangs as soon as I woke up that morning.
Then there’s the obvious poor recovery (22%), low heart rate variability (39 ms) and high resting heart rate (75 bpm) due to the physiological stress caused by under-eating. It even affected my respiratory rate that night, which has consistently been 13.8 since the first day I used WHOOP.",5/7/21
eating-fruits-vegetables-resting-heart-rate,"Positive Impact of Eating Fruits and Vegetables on Strain, Recovery & Resting Heart Rate","Many of the most popular new year’s resolutions we make involve nutrition and finding ways to eat healthier. With so many people adjusting their diets in the new year, we examine how consuming fruits and vegetables affects WHOOP members’ recovery and strain metrics, as well as patterns we see in the data.
We studied the data of over 30,000 of our members who regularly record consumption of fruits and vegetables in the WHOOP Journal. The basic idea was to compare their typical strain and recovery between days that they did and did not consume fruits and vegetables. More specifically, we also examined trends in when fruits and vegetables were consumed, as well as corresponding differences in recovery, resting heart rate, and strain.
In total, we looked at approximately 3.5 million journal entries spanning the course of about a year.
## BENEFITS OF FRUITS & VEGETABLES TO STRAIN, RECOVERY, RESTING HEART RATE
We know that fruits and vegetables provide a variety of vitamins and nutrients, and can even reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, but how does consumption impact our members’ strain and recovery? We examined WHOOP members’ strain on the day they report consumption and their recovery and resting heart rate (RHR) on the following day.
On average, WHOOP members record a 4% higher strain on days that they consume fruits and vegetables–the takeaway being they likely exercise more or push themselves a little harder on days they follow cleaner eating habits.
Additionally, they also wake up the next day with average recoveries 3% higher and resting heart rates 1 beat per minute lower.

This analysis suggests a strong positive population-level relationship between fruits and vegetable consumption and next-day recovery. Introducing, or increasing, fruits and vegetables to a diet may be that extra step that helps get you in the green!
Using the WHOOP Journal, you can track consumption, as well as other aspects of diet and lifestyle to see how they impact your data. For example, does wearing an eye mask improve your sleep and recovery? Or how about taking melatonin or magnesium before bed? When you log these and other behaviors in the journal, WHOOP can provide you with actionable insights as to how they affect your various metrics.

eating-fruits-vegetables-resting-heart-rate,"Positive Impact of Eating Fruits and Vegetables on Strain, Recovery & Resting Heart Rate","Recovery INCREASES with MORE Fruits & Vegetables
Within the journal feature, members can also record how many servings of fruits and vegetables they consumed in a day. When they do that, the average daily amount is 3 servings.
We analyzed the relationship between number of servings and recovery, and found that for each serving members reported consuming there is a related average increase in recovery by about half a percentage point.
More servings of fruits and vegetables leads to greater increases in average recovery.
The same trend also extended to resting heart rate, with the average member decreasing almost a half a beat per minute for each serving of fruits and vegetables consumed.
We found that these results were consistent for both men and women across strain and resting heart rate. For recovery, we saw a slightly greater average increase for men (3.2%) than for women (2.5%)",1/28/22
eating-fruits-vegetables-resting-heart-rate,"Positive Impact of Eating Fruits and Vegetables on Strain, Recovery & Resting Heart Rate","HEALTHY EATING TRENDS BY AGE, TIME OF YEAR & DAY OF WEEK
In the fall and winter months around the holiday season we saw fewer instances of fruit and vegetable consumption, even though the number of total members tracking stayed mostly consistent. However in the new year, there was a 3% increase in “yes” responses to consumed fruits and vegetables, potentially due to a new year’s change in diets.
Fruit and vegetable consumption decreased heading into the holiday season, then rose again in January.
Breaking it down by day of the week also gives us some noteworthy insights into WHOOP members’ eating habits. Although consumption is strong mid-week, members aren’t eating as many fruits and vegetables over the weekend. We know that average recovery tends to dip on the weekends as well, so paying more attention to fruit and vegetable intake on those days could help.
Fruit and vegetable consumption is highest mid-week and decreases on the weekends.
As we split our analysis out into age groups, a clear trend emerges in the data–as age increases, the relationship between weekends and lower consumption flattens out. This indicates that older members are more consistent with their daily fruit and vegetable intake, while younger members often neglect fruits and vegetables on the weekends. We also found that overall, as members get older they are more likely to consume fruits and veggies each day.
As WHOOP members get older they become more consistent with their fruit and vegetable intake.",1/28/22

effect-of-sleep-loss-on-performance-working-under-the-influence-wui,Effect of Sleep Loss on Performance: Working Under the Influence (WUI?),"Now you may think, “well those are extreme examples. I never stay up 24 hours straight.” And me neither, at least not since I moved from New Orleans. But consider the example I gave prior. In that scenario I was waking up at 7am, doing my work day, going out to see a friend, watching TV at home, and internet trolling until midnight, when I’m off to bed. That’s not a day out of the ordinary and right there I’ve been awake for 17 hours. And, as we’ve now learned, without sufficient sleep to catch up, it is highly probable that I will show up to work the next day at the equivalent of tipsy, at the very least, and bordering on cognitively drunk.
What’s worse, humans are decidedly poor judges of their own levels of fitness, mentally and physically. We may think, after that cup of coffee and a solid meal, you’re not that sleepy. Studies have found, however, that subjective ratings of sleepiness do not correlate with subsequent performance. We aren’t good at assessing our own attentional state or well-being. And, as a result, may often sacrifice sleep without knowing the physical toll that’s actually taking on our bodies. It’s not socially acceptable for me to show up intoxicated to work. Beyond the basic lack of professionalism I’d be displaying, I’d also be unfit to contribute productively to the team. This begs the question: should it be considered unprofessional to get too little sleep?
As a society we put a premium on efficiency. We go to great lengths to fit as much activity as possible into waking hours. But maybe we have it all wrong. If our executive functioning is as compromised by sleepiness as it is by alcohol, we ought to put sleep in the forefront of our plans if we truly want to get the most out of ourselves during the day.

effect-of-sleep-loss-on-performance-working-under-the-influence-wui,Effect of Sleep Loss on Performance: Working Under the Influence (WUI?),"Productivity: the cornerstone of capitalist America. But how do we achieve that magical state? That optimal flow where deadlines are met, schedules grind forward at ever-increasing pace, and you’re staying on top of the competition?
The answer, most often, seems to require cutting corners on sleep. The average working American spends 9am-5pm at a job site (if not longer), commutes to and from work, and in what little free time remains will sprinkle in social time with friends and family, exercise, or any number of leisure activities of interest. After all, the more we fit into waking hours, the more we get done, right?
This logic certainly appeals to me. I’m notoriously bad at compromising, and why should I? If I manage my time right, I can balance exercise, socializing, some cooking (it’s a struggle), and reading, all in the non-work time frame. As long as I’m in bed by midnight I’m getting some good sleep (it only takes one cup of coffee in the morning to get me going so that’s pretty good!). I don’t have kids so what’s my excuse not to optimize my time?
That schedule, however, has chronic partial sleep loss written all over it. And I would not be in the minority. A study conducted by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, published in February 2016, concluded that more than a third of American adults aged 18-60 years do not get enough sleep. The recommendation they cite, determined by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society, calls for at least 7 hours each night for optimal health. Your precise sleep need is much more individual than that (consult this white paper for more information) but the aforementioned 7-hour threshold is a good place to start when evaluating the average American’s schedule.",2/13/17
effect-of-sleep-loss-on-performance-working-under-the-influence-wui,Effect of Sleep Loss on Performance: Working Under the Influence (WUI?),"The reality is: if you’re operating with chronic sleep loss you’re not only functioning sub-optimally, you’re impaired. That may sound dramatic, and before last week I would have agreed with you. But then I read the article “Fatigue, Alcohol and Performance Impairment” from the journal Nature. In it, the researchers quantify the impact of fatigue due to sleep loss in terms we can understand: equivalent alcohol intoxication. For the experiment a group of 40 participants were broken up in to two groups: one group was kept awake for 28 hours, simulating pulling an all-nighter, and the other consumed 10-15g of alcohol at 30-minute intervals until their blood alcohol concentration reached 0.10%. Each group was given a performance task that required them to react as quickly as possible to visual cues randomly timed on a computer. The results were fascinating.
As you would imagine, the longer a person was kept awake, the worse they did on the performance task. The same, of course, was true for the subjects getting progressively more intoxicated. The correlation between the two groups, however, is the scary part. The researchers determined that after 17 hours of sustained wakefulness, performance on the task decreased to a level equivalent to a participant whose blood alcohol concentration was 0.05%. Further, after 24 hours of sustained wakefulness, performance on the task was equivalent to those with a BAC of 0.10%. For reference, you’ll get a DUI in every state if your BAC is 0.08%.",2/13/17
effects-of-travel-shaping-future-of-nba,Effects of Travel Shaping Future of NBA,"For the past several years, the NBA has experimented with scheduling one or two games each season in London and Mexico City. One of the goals of the “NBA Global Games” is to gauge whether or not expanding the league internationally is a realistic possibility.
A flight to Mexico City isn’t much different than many others within the continental United States, but the trip to London crosses 5-8 time zones, depending on where a team is coming from. Largely for this reason, league commissioner Adam Silver recently proclaimed that Europe is not a viable option in terms of possible international expansion.
Silver addressed the topic at the Sloan Sports Analytics conference earlier this month, saying the NBA is looking closely at Mexico City “because it is very reachable.” He added that advances in sleep science and a better understanding of the effects of travel will prevent the league from considering expanding overseas in the near future:
Adam Silver cites rest and logistics as a reason why #NBA teams in Europe are unlikely any time soon.
— SiriusXM NBA Radio (@SiriusXMNBA) November 17, 2016
Given the current state of the NBA, it comes as no surprise that travel issues are the league’s primary concern when considering potential growth.
Star players missing games to rest is becoming a bigger and bigger issue, as evidenced by last week’s heavily promoted showdown between the Warriors and Spurs in San Antonio. The nationally televised contest featuring the NBA’s two best teams quickly transformed into a complete dud, as Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Kawhi Leonard, LaMarcus Aldridge and Tony Parker were all sidelined.
Warriors coach Steve Kerr made the decision to sit many of his players in response to Golden State’s recent travel schedule. Via ESPN’s Tom Haberstroh, Kerr said:",3/17/17
effects-of-travel-shaping-future-of-nba,Effects of Travel Shaping Future of NBA,"“It’s truly insane. This is the worst stretch of schedule that I’ve ever been a part of and I’ve been in the league since 1988. I’ve never seen anything like this, eight games in eight cities with 11,000 miles.”
From February 27 through March 11, the Warriors played in Philadelphia, Washington, Chicago, New York, Atlanta, Oakland, Minneapolis and San Antonio. The final five games of that stretch took place in a span of just seven days.
While choosing to hold his top players out of action for the marquee matchup against the Spurs could be viewed as a sign of protest from Kerr, he was also quick not to fault the commissioner. Per Haberstroh, Kerr added “What I really respect about Adam Silver is he’s been really proactive about trying to deal with this issue. He’s all ears when we talk to him.”
Last month, Silver echoed a similar sentiment at his All-Star Game press conference. Via Chris Fedor of Cleveland.com, Silver stated:
“I do recognize that there isn’t an easy solution to that problem … [we] have to be realistic that the science has gotten to the point where there is that direct correlation that we’re aware of between fatigue and injuries. And as tough as it is on our fans to miss one of their favorite players for a game, it’s far better than having them get injured and be out for long periods of time. So we’re always still looking to strike that right balance.”
There’s no doubt that travel and time zone changes have a negative impact on athletes’ performance. As Silver suggested, there isn’t an obvious answer either. However, the first step to combatting fatigue from travel may simply be player awareness. From a Haberstroh ESPN piece on the measures taken by some Los Angeles Clippers:",3/17/17

elite-marathoner-shares-her-top-training-tips,Elite Marathoner Shares Her Top Training Tips,"I’ve always loved the mental and physical benefits of yoga, but during marathon training, I notice a huge difference in how it affects my running. I set aside 30 minutes a day to do yoga exercises, and enjoy a restorative yoga class once a week. During high mileage weeks, my legs (and brain) tend to be really fatigued. Without the necessary pre- and post-run stretching (that yoga can offer), muscles tend to become brittle, inflexible, and prone to injury. Yoga helps ensure that I give my body the stretching and strengthening I need to stay injury-free.
4. Increase your mileage by running your commute.
With marathon training, it’s crucial to get your miles in. Instead of driving to work, I run. It’s 5 miles each way, and it’s an easy way to boost my mileage volume without thinking much about it.
5. Train with friends and teammates.
I used to do all my runs alone. I still love running alone to clear my mind, but when it comes to a workout, it makes such a difference to have your teammates and friends by your side. Helpful tip: Let your teammates know what your workout schedule will be a week early, so you can sync up meeting times and workouts!
6. Race often.
I sign up for at least 2 races a month. Months in advance, I think about some key races that serve as great workouts that simulate marathon pace or a hard speed workout. During my 16-week marathon cycle, I’ve run a couple 5Ks, 10K, 2 half marathons, a 10-miler, and a 20-miler. They force me to get my speedwork done in the context of a race, which is motivating.
7. Keep a detailed running log.
Without a running log, how will you keep track of improvements or setbacks? My running log lists all my runs, workouts, races, shoes worn, and even heart rate. Not only does this help my coach evaluate my training, it allows me to see the progress I’ve made.
8. Listen to your body.",3/30/17

1. Hire a coach.
Hire a coach who you trust, and who understands your relationship with running. Having friends to train with is great, but my running drastically improved when I hired a personal coach who customized my workouts towards my goals. My coach creates a challenging, yet flexible training schedule that keeps the difficult training fun and enjoyable for me.
2. Increase your aerobic capacity.
During marathon training, it’s important to mix up your workouts. Long, steady mileage won’t necessarily make you faster. Fartleks, hills, progression runs, speedwork on the track and strides are just some of the ways I create variety in my training plan.
3. Incorporate yoga into your weekly routine.",3/30/17

“It’s frankly one of my favorite type of deals because it’s not just about making money for players, or with players, it’s a holistic deal. … As a pro athlete, [WHOOP] can help you train better and smarter and be more prepared for game day. And as you’re transitioning out of the NFL, or any other pro league, it can help you stay healthy, or get healthy.”
Many NFL players are already fans of WHOOP (Examples “A” and “B” via social media), regardless of the potential monetary benefits. Chargers Pro-Bowler Darrell Stuckey has been wearing a Strap since last fall and raves about it.
Diamond Leung of SportTechie discussed other players’ interest:
“During a recent NFL Players Association reps meeting, WHOOP straps were handed out so that the players in attendance could be introduced to the product. Cleveland Browns defensive back Ibraheim Campbell hasn’t stopped using the wearable device since then.
‘I don’t take it off,’ Campbell said. ‘It’s pretty cool. I’ve seen my awareness of myself and how I’m doing increase. It’s been big on my sleep awareness and sleeping habits.’”

ESPN’s Kevin Seifert expanded on this notion:
“Even at the dawn of the wearable technology era, NFL receiver Andrew Hawkins could see where it was all headed. There would come a day, Hawkins said, when player evaluation and even contract negotiations would hinge on the presumably objective data collected from chips inserted in shoulder pads for practices and games. … ‘It’s a matter of time before it gets here,’ Hawkins said in 2015, when he played for the Cleveland Browns. ‘You just have to hope there is a balance.’
Indeed, the NFL Players Association appears to have produced an equalizer of sorts … This will provide players with their own data — information they own and have the right to sell and distribute as they wish — to push back against the NFL’s accumulation of its own data.”

Just ask Elon Musk. He’s been known to log 80, 100, even 120-hour work weeks, and what did he have to say about it? “It’s not been great, actually,” in typical Musk fashion. His grueling schedule and lack of sleep took a toll on his well being. In other words, don’t work until you drop, it’s not sustainable long-term.
Instead, try to think and act as if you were an elite athlete. Focus on performance. Doing so will guide you away from burnout and towards optimal physical and mental health.
When your body and mind are in ‘performance mode,’ you’re in an optimal state. You’re making smart decisions at the right time on the things that really matter–something all too important when running a business. This becomes even more crucial when you have a team supporting you, because your performance ultimately guides and influences your team’s performance too.
How do I know this works? Because I live it daily. I’ve focused on and improved my performance to become as efficient as possible. I even have the data to prove it, thanks to WHOOP.",4/26/19
entrepreneur-time-management,Performance Optimization for Entrepreneurs,"Big client meeting where peak performance is required? WHOOP will provide your optimal time to get to bed. If the next day is just the standard, tell the Sleep Planner, and it will give you a new recommended bedtime. And finally, if you need to finish up a project and skimp on sleep, it tells you how much sleep you need to get by without feeling completely crushed.
Upon waking, WHOOP provides insights on the previous night’s sleep performance, factoring in a variety of physiological elements that help determine how recovered you are for the day ahead:
WHOOP has helped me understand that sleep provides the mental and physical recharge required to make better decisions, focus on what matters, and perform at my best. With adequate sleep and a focus on performance, entrepreneurs can get the edge they need to sustain and, ultimately, succeed.",4/26/19
entrepreneur-time-management,Performance Optimization for Entrepreneurs,"It’s a small sample, but it does provide reasoning to reinforce the importance of recovery after a stressful work week. While I don’t believe in the need to achieve a perfect balance, I do believe recovery is necessary to ensure top performance.
On that note, let’s talk about sleep. WHOOP has been instrumental in helping me optimize recovery, improve sleep habits, and create a more efficient working style.
After reviewing my sleep performance data, I realized that days I was sleep deprived regularly correlated with days I made more mistakes and took longer to complete my work. It became clear to me that a lack of sleep hurt my ability to effectively connect and communicate with my team, clients, and partners. I got into more arguments at home and with friends, and also felt more stress in general, which carried over to affect my performance level at work. My head wasn’t in the game, and I felt so tired that I was often operating at half speed.
As you might imagine, there is a lot of evidence to support my experience. In a recent UCLA sleep study, researchers found that starving the body of sleep robs brain neurons of the ability to function properly and, in turn, leads to cognitive lapses in how we perceive and react to the world around us. So while a person can look awake and alert, their brain is not as energetic as it should (or could) be.
What does this all mean? Activity on little sleep does NOT enable productivity. Just because work is being done, that doesn’t mean it is being done well. And, in my opinion, work done poorly is a complete waste of time management and energy, you might as well be sleeping.
That is why the WHOOP Sleep Planner is such a game changer. By shedding light on real sleep data, and encouraging sleep, it can ultimately be used to max out work efficiency and productivity. I also love that it allows the user to adjust their schedule to the type of day ahead of them:",4/26/19
entrepreneur-time-management,Performance Optimization for Entrepreneurs,"It all began because I was data curious. I knew collecting data on lifestyle habits and performance would help me to analyze and improve my work efficiency. In my quest for seeking the optimal solution to get the data I needed, I tested a LOT of apps and wearables. When I found WHOOP, I knew I had a winner.
I wasn’t alone. WHOOP is on the forefront of providing intelligence to the most elite athletes in the world (examples A, B, C, D, etc, the list goes on and on…). Learning this made me even more confident that it would help me get the edge I wanted.
While entrepreneurs don’t train like elite athletes, our ability to perform is driven by the same factors that impact athletic performance. But unlike athletes who typically compete only a few times a week and have off-seasons, entrepreneurs need to be game-ready every day. By using data to analyze stress levels and initiate recovery, entrepreneurs can ensure top performance on a daily basis.
To provide some personal evidence, I took a look at the strain on my body from a hiking trip where I climbed four mountain passes wearing a 50-pound backpack. Then, I compared that data to my work week prior to the trip:
Although the total strain on my body from hiking was greater than during my work week, the strain from a high-stress workday that included no physical activity (represented in blue in the chart) was surprisingly comparable to climbing up, over, and down a single mountain.
The Friday before my hiking trip I had a board meeting, which demands a ton of energy and creates mental and physical strain. As a result, my strain score was high, reaching 14.9 (on a 0-21 scale), just slightly lower than the last day of my trip when I hiked 9 hours and summited Buckskin Mountain. Insane!",4/26/19

everything-to-know-about-sleep,Everything You Want to Know About Sleep & Tracking It with WHOOP,"## Sleep Basics
On average, WHOOP members get slightly more than 7 hours of sleep per night. However, they also average close to 8 hours in bed.
Sleep Averages by Age, Gender, Day of Week & More
One of the first things people usually notice when they start tracking their sleep is that they’re not really getting as much as they thought they were. The percentage of time you spend in bed actually asleep is known as your sleep efficiency. Below are some behaviors we’ve found that increase and decrease WHOOP members’ sleep efficiency:
Behaviors that positively and negatively Affect WHOOP members’ sleep efficiency.
Many people have poor sleep efficiency because they often struggle to fall asleep. The time it takes you to fall asleep is called your sleep latency.
28 Techniques to Fall Asleep Fast
## Sleep Stages
There are 4 stages of sleep that make up your nightly sleep cycles:
Here’s a breakdown of the average time WHOOP members spend in each stage:
Norms for how much time WHOOP members spend in each sleep stage.
Deep and REM sleep are the two restorative stages of sleep where your body and mind heal and repair themselves. However, they each have different characteristics and functions.
How to Increase Deep Sleep How to Increase REM Sleep
“Awake” is included as a sleep stage because it is natural to experience a number of disturbances (also referred to as wake events) throughout the night–brief periods of time spent awake that you aren’t even conscious of.
WHOOP tracks your disturbances (Wake events) throughout the night and time spent awake during sleep.

Based on your previous sleep and what you do during the day, the WHOOP Sleep Planner calculates exactly how much sleep your body needs each night.
Factors That Affect Your Personal Sleep Need
Here are just a few of the many reasons why it’s important to get enough sleep:
Greater cognitive functioning and impulse control
Stronger immune system
Better overall metabolic health

## Sleep Debt
When you fail to meet your sleep need, you begin to accumulate sleep debt. If you build up too much sleep debt, you become sleep deprived.
The WHOOP Sleep Planner calculates your sleep debt and factors it into your nightly sleep need.
A great method for avoiding sleep debt is to nap during the day if you have the chance. Naps of certain lengths can be beneficial in various ways.

## Sleep Consistency
Your body has a 24-hour internal clock called your circadian rhythm. Going to bed and waking up at similar times each day helps regulate it and improves the quality of your sleep. We refer to this as sleep consistency.

exertion-running-boston-marathon,What Exertion Looks Like Running the Boston Marathon,"On Monday April 15th, 2019, Caroline Shannon crossed the Boston Marathon finish line with an official time of 3:01:56 (6:57/mile), a personal best out of the four marathons she’s run. Shannon, a professional architect and WHOOP member, credits tapering and getting more sleep for a perfectly executed race. “I felt more prepared than ever with my training,” she said.
On top of her three-minute PR, this was Shannon’s first year running a marathon with WHOOP by her side. We decided to take a closer look at her data before, during, and afterwards to see how prepared her body was and how her exertion progressed along the course.
## Pre-race Stats:
Recovery: 93% Sleep Performance: 68% (only 5:15 hours of sleep)
Recovery: 93% Sleep Performance: 68% (only 5:15 hours of sleep)
Shannon cut her mileage by 50% in the two weeks leading up to the race. The effects of tapering are scientifically proven to increase VO2 max and your anaerobic threshold, which prepare your body for high-intensity periods. While she blames nervous energy for losing sleep the night before the race, she took a long nap the previous day and had been getting to bed much earlier than usual in preparation. Her body still woke up almost fully recovered, as shown by her WHOOP data.",4/18/19
exertion-running-boston-marathon,What Exertion Looks Like Running the Boston Marathon,"The Marathon:
Below is a map of the Boston marathon course, which begins in the humble suburban town of Hopkinton and travels through Middlesex County until it reaches Boston. We’ve chosen several timestamps along the course to depict Shannon’s WHOOP strain and total calories burned.
Shannon took off just after 10 am when her WHOOP strain was 7.6. It didn’t take long for that to double; seven miles in it was approaching 15. By the time she reached Wellesley College, otherwise known as the “scream tunnel” for the crowds of cheering women, her strain had hit 18.2 and she was averaging a 170 bpm heart rate. Next up, of course, were the Newton Hills. For anyone who has run Boston, the Newton Hills will make or break you. You either power through patiently, albeit uncomfortably, or you slow down significantly and accept that your quads and glutes will be on fire for the next six miles.
It was at this point that Shannon’s strain breached the 20.0 mark. WHOOP strain operates on a proprietary 0 to 21 scale; the closer you get the 21, the harder it becomes. Shannon’s incremental increase in strain as the race progressed was basically her max effort as she approached 21.",4/18/19
fact-or-fiction-does-exercise-close-to-bedtime-harm-sleep-quality,Fact or Fiction: Does Exercise Close to Bedtime Harm Sleep Quality?,"So what’s going on here? It seems like there are two opposing effects on sleep (1) exercise at any intensity during the day improves sleep quality at night and (2) exercise close to bedtime may make it harder to fall asleep. What it comes down to then, is which is the stronger driver of sleep quality – do you get more benefit from exercise than you get harm from exercise lateness such that the positive effect of (1) outweighs the negative effect of (2) or does the opposite happen where the positive effect of (1) is outweighed by the negative of (2)? This, to us at WHOOP, is the beauty of human physiology, because the answer is a big, fat “it depends!”
For illustrative purposes, let’s say its 9 pm, you haven’t had time to exercise yet, and are trying to figure out if it’s a bad idea to go for a quick run. Several factors must be considered when determining if you personally (and not merely the “average athlete” or even the “average 25-year-old female elite sprinter”) will benefit from getting a few miles in. These factors include obvious things like that night’s intended bedtime (if I race 10 miles and try to curl up on the finish line and fall asleep within 30 seconds of finishing, I’m going to have a bad time of it), so the National Sleep Foundation’s poll may be misleading simply because they lumped everything into binary “more than 4 hours” and “less than 4 hours” categories, which may mask important differences between, for example, 0-1 hours and 1-4 hours.
It is therefore difficult to conclude how these results would translate to real-world exercise situations and doesn’t help our hypothetical athlete wondering if he should go for a 9 pm run. To understand the real-world implications of late night exercise, we turned to our data.",1/27/17
fact-or-fiction-does-exercise-close-to-bedtime-harm-sleep-quality,Fact or Fiction: Does Exercise Close to Bedtime Harm Sleep Quality?,"## Introduction
If you turn to the Internet for advice about improving sleep quality, you will find near- consensus on the evils of late-night high-intensity exercise, but can you believe everything you read on the internet?
By their very natures, exercise and sleep demand opposite responses from our bodies; exercise raises body temperature while natural sleep onset is typically preempted by a decrease in body temperature and exercise produces activating hormones including adrenaline and cortisol which amp us up, while sleep requires us to wind down. Given this, why question the veracity of this widespread advice?
In 2013, the National Sleep Foundation conducted a large-scale survey called the “Sleep in America Poll” which focused on the relationship between exercise and sleep. Unsurprisingly, the poll found that people who exercised (at any intensity level) slept better than did people who did not exercise at all. They also broke down exercise timing relative to bedtime into two groups by separating exercise more than 4 hours before bed from exercise less than 4 hours before bed. Following vigorous to moderate exercise days, the percentage of people reporting improved sleep quality who exercised within 4 hours of bed (55%) was not statistically significantly different from the 54% of people reporting improved sleep quality who exercised at vigorous to moderate levels more than 4 hours before bed – not at all the detriment to sleep quality that the myriad of listicles warning against getting your late night sweat on would make you think.",1/27/17
fact-or-fiction-does-exercise-close-to-bedtime-harm-sleep-quality,Fact or Fiction: Does Exercise Close to Bedtime Harm Sleep Quality?,"To check for this phenomenon in our data, the most recent 45 days’ worth of sleeps were gathered. These were then filtered for having a moderate to vigorous activity at some point during the day. As in the NSF study, exercise within 4 hours of bedtime was significantly less common than exerciser earlier in the day, representing about 11% of the data. Following moderate to vigorous exercise within four hours of bedtime, the average WHOOP athlete saw sleep efficiency that was 0.999% of their baseline sleep efficiency, while the same intensity of exercise completed more than four hours before bedtime resulted in sleep efficiencies that were 1.001 times their baseline efficiencies. In both cases, baseline was defined as their average over the last 45 days, and people were excluded from this analysis if they had fewer than 15 recorded sleeps during this period. We note that neither result was statistically significant nor practically significant. A change of 0.001% in efficiency per 8-hour block spent in bed would result in less than one minute of lost or added true sleep, which is unlikely to result in practical performance differences during the day.",1/27/17

Before diving in, several key differences between the WHOOP data and the NSF data should be noted. Specifically:
The NSF report showed that 51% of people perceive their sleep quality to improve on days they exercise. Interestingly, this phenomenon was strongest in those they characterized as vigorous exercisers, with 62% of that population reporting improved sleep quality on exercise days. To reproduce this data, WHOOP looked at the most recent 10,000 sleeps collected by its users after either vigorous exercise days or rest days. WHOOP measures the cardiovascular strain of a day on a scale from 0-21, the motivation for which is explored elsewhere. For this report, “vigorous” was defined as a strain over 15, a score one might expect to receive for 45-minutes of running at 70% of VO2max and “rest” was defined as below 8.0, which roughly corresponds to the level seen on days on which any amount of exercise is undergone. 17% of the 10,000 sleeps fell into the vigorous category, 28% met the “rest” category criteria and the remaining sleeps were categorized as light to moderate activity days. Table 1 below shows the differences in sleep efficiency (percentage of time dedicated to sleep actually spent asleep) by activity level.",1/27/17
fact-or-fiction-does-exercise-close-to-bedtime-harm-sleep-quality,Fact or Fiction: Does Exercise Close to Bedtime Harm Sleep Quality?,"As reported by the NSF, WHOOP data shows that following exercise, the average user will experience a sleep efficiency that may be marginally higher than that experienced on days when they rest, and that this effect may increase in magnitude as vigor increases. We note, however, that the effect size observed here is small and not statistically significant, suggesting that there are almost certainly many variables at play. While beyond the scope of this report, it is interesting to consider that the NSF reported on user-perceived sleep quality while the WHOOP data presented in Table 1 is objectively measured sleep quality; the difference in significance of our findings might allude to the presence of a conformation bias or placebo effect where the expectation of improved sleep quality causes users to perceive and therefore report on higher sleep quality than may have truly been experienced.
One variable which is often suggested is workout timing relative to bedtime, when evaluating this variable, the NSF survey separated workouts into binary categories (1) within 4 hours of bedtime, and (2) more than 4 hours before bedtime. They did not see differences in sleep quality between these two groups and therefore concluded that “exercise, or physical activity in general, is generally good for sleep, regardless of the time of day the activity is performed.”",1/27/17
fact-or-fiction-does-exercise-close-to-bedtime-harm-sleep-quality,Fact or Fiction: Does Exercise Close to Bedtime Harm Sleep Quality?,"What Does this Mean for You?
Like so many other physiological phenomena, huge inter-individual factors are at play, and different people are going to be differently sensitive to different things. Take, for example, one elite male runner who in the last 45 days has exercised at moderate to vigorous intensities both within and prior to four hours before bed. In his case, there is still not a statistically significant but much larger than previously observed difference between the sleep efficiencies following exercise within four hours of bedtime (86.3%) and that following exercise completed earlier in the day (88.3%). Compare this to an average female runner training for her first marathon who statistically significantly sleeps better following late-night exercise (sleep efficiency mean = 96.4%) than following earlier exercise (sleep efficiency = 93.2%). While we could provide endless examples, these two illustrate the fact that the direction and magnitude of the correlation between exercise timing and sleep quality are highly variable, so the only way to know if it is ok to go for that 9 pm run is to try it.",1/27/17
fat-burning-heart-rate-zone,The Truth About the Fat Burning Heart Rate Zone,"Heart Rate Zone for Weight Loss?
However, the percentage of fat you’re burning relative to carbohydrates is not what determines weight loss. As stated above, the less active you are, the more fat you burn in relation to carbs.
Obviously being inactive isn’t the way to go to lose weight. Your body requires less energy and burns less fuel as activity decreases, so the fat burned is just a larger percentage of a smaller number.
We all know exercise promotes weight loss, and what you have to do is burn calories.
## Elevate Your Heart Rate to Burn Calories and Lose Weight
In order to lose weight by working out, you must create an energy deficit, which is simply a matter of calories in vs. calories out–burning more than you consume. The more frequently you exercise, and the harder you push yourself while exercising, the more calories you will burn.
When you work out in higher heart rate zones, your body burns calories at a faster rate. There’s no reason to limit yourself to the “fat burning heart rate” when weight loss is your intended result.
Additionally, more strenuous workouts (including weightlifting) can contribute to losing weight even after you’re done exercising. Your metabolism often keeps working for up to 2-3 hours to repair damage done to your body.
## What the Fat Burning HR Zone is Useful For
While there’s no reason to think of it as the best heart rate zone for weight loss, there is still value to working out in the fat burning zone in some cases. In particular, it can be useful for endurance athletes in training and competition.
For example, a distance runner who stays in their fat burning HR zone during a race can conserve energy and tap into their quick-to-break-down reserve fuel supply for a burst of speed at the finish.
It is also possible to train for much longer durations of time when exercising in this zone.",9/5/20
fat-burning-heart-rate-zone,The Truth About the Fat Burning Heart Rate Zone,"While there is a specific heart rate zone for working out that will technically burn more fat than others, it is not necessary to try to target this HR zone in order to lose weight.
Below we’ll explain a bit about how heart rate zones work, what the fat burning HR zone is, what it’s useful for, and why when it comes to weight loss and exercise, what really matters is burning calories.
## What is the Fat Burning Heart Rate Zone?
When training, athletes often aim to work out at certain percentages of their max heart rate in order to accomplish different goals. The various percentages are referred to as heart rate zones (see graphic below). For the most part, the optimal heart rate for fat burning is generally considered to be about 70% of your max HR.

## How the Fat Burning Zone Works
Your body gets most of its fuel by burning a combination of fat and carbohydrates. The more active you are, the greater percentage of carbs it burns as opposed to fat. Why is this the case?
Carbohydrates are a less dense form of energy than fats, which makes them easier to break down. When the intensity level of your exercise increases, your heart rate rises and your body needs energy more quickly, so it turns to the source that can be accessed faster.
For this reason, lower intensity workouts burn a higher percentage of fat compared to carbs than higher intensity efforts do. That is why the heart rate zone for burning fat is also categorized in the chart above as “light” exertion level. The “70% of max HR” number comes from it being strenuous enough exercise to burn fuel, but not too strenuous to burn carbs instead of fat.",9/5/20
fat-burning-heart-rate-zone,The Truth About the Fat Burning Heart Rate Zone,"Track Your HR Zones with the WHOOP Strain Target
WHOOP measures your heart rate 24/7 and quantifies the strain your body takes on each day, and during individual workouts. Every morning, our recovery metric (calculated using heart rate variability, resting heart rate, respiratory rate and sleep) tells you how prepared your body is to take on strain so you’ll know hard hard to push yourself when exercising.
By tracking your activities with the WHOOP Strain Target, you can see in real time exactly which heart rate zone you’re in in order to meet your fitness goals.",9/5/20

We fully understand that the demands of our daily lives often prevent us from getting an optimal amount of sleep, and some nights you’re going to want more sleep than others. The WHOOP Sleep Planner takes worrying about your sleep schedule off your plate by giving you the option of customizing your nightly sleep notifications based on your performance goals for each day of the week.
Plan your week ahead of time by choosing which nights you want enough sleep to peak (100% of your sleep need), perform (85%) or get by (70%). The Sleep Planner will then determine the ideal time for you to get in bed each night and wake up each morning in order to meet your goals, and will send you a nightly notification based on the preferences you choose.
If you have a consistent schedule and would like to hit certain goals on the same day every week (maybe you’re at your best by starting things off fresh and peaking on Mondays, or maybe you have easy days on Fridays and are happy just to get by?), you can leave them as your default settings.

feels-vs-facts-why-you-need-rest-days-in-training,"Feels vs Facts: Why You Still Need a Rest Day, Even When You're Feeling Good","Effects of Overreaching on the Endocrine System
A 2018 study in the journal Hormones found that male athletes training over seven hours per week had a 10% reduction in testosterone levels after one year of training, and a 30% reduction after five years training. A 2020 study in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health found that in a single season, testosterone levels dropped as volume increased, before rebounding as volume stabilized. Numerous studies have similar findings for male athletes, seeing a relationship between sustained, higher volume training and negative endocrine impacts.
The relationship is more difficult to study in female athletes due to the monthly variation in the menstrual cycle, but you could fill a tractor trailer with printed-out studies connecting low energy availability with hormonal disturbances.
A 2019 article in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism described how even small offsets between energy consumption and expenditure can suppress sex hormones, hurt bone density, increase injury rates, and decrease adpation to training. And, energy availability is not just about making sure you get enough over the course of a day. Endocrine system disruptions also result from excessive within-day deficits (2017 study on female athletes; 2018 study on male athletes).
Plus, for male and female athletes alike, chronic exposure to stress hormone cortisol can wreak havoc on the endocrine system. Every training day risks turning down the knob on sex hormones, turning up the knob on cortisol, and causing minor offsets in energy availability. Rest days are endocrine system insurance, allowing for glycogen recovery and stabilization of cortisol levels.
KEY POINT:
KEY POINT: Endocrine system stabilization is essential for an athlete to actually adapt to the work they are doing. Keep the pedal to the metal, and the engine will overheat, if the car is lucky enough to not fly off a cliff first.",4/14/22
feels-vs-facts-why-you-need-rest-days-in-training,"Feels vs Facts: Why You Still Need a Rest Day, Even When You're Feeling Good","Impact of a Rest Day on WHOOP Recovery
The information comes from a massive dataset on “red” days from users, when the WHOOP recovery metric indicates that an athlete is not primed for strain, primarily relying on those nervous system variables. The big question: How do training levels on a red day impact WHOOP variables the next day?
Members who had restorative (low) strain on a red day were 2.3 times less likely to have another red day than members who overreached (higher strain). Additionally, 85% of members who had restorative strain on a red day avoided a second red day. Meanwhile, overreaching on a red day led to a 46% chance of another red day, and those double-red members had about a one-third chance of backing that up with a third red day after that.
Higher strain on a red day increases the chances of staying in the red the next day, and decreases the likelihood of getting back in the green.
What worries us most is that string of red days that happens with continually training through nervous system signals from WHOOP data. A day here or there where HRV goes down is normal, and likely won’t have a huge impact on adaptation. But stacking those red days up may get risky for long-term health, not just performance.
KEY POINT: Overreaching on a red day may be risky for long-term health and performance.
## Takeaway
We like athletes to take a full rest day once a week. Unfortunately, we can’t do daily blood tests or salivary hormone measurements. Thankfully, WHOOP helps us see under the hood and understand how the body is actually responding to strain, and our observations overlap with what these data show–if athletes fail to create the context for growth via consistent rest and recovery, all the training in the world can amount to stagnation, regression, or an injury.
So be proud of your rest days. Training doesn’t make champions. Recovery makes champions.",4/14/22
feels-vs-facts-why-you-need-rest-days-in-training,"Feels vs Facts: Why You Still Need a Rest Day, Even When You're Feeling Good","Stress and the Nervous System
The hardest part about being an athlete can be understanding how daily perceptions of how you feel actually correspond to what’s happening in the body. While that’s a big problem for hormones and blood counts, it’s especially difficult for the nervous system.
In the worst cases, miscalibrated stress monitoring can lead to overtraining syndrome, where the nervous system shuts down and prevents most performance altogether. As a 2014 review in Current Sports Medicine Reports said: “the insidious onset of OTS slowly saps the efficacy of recovery times so the athlete is no longer able to reach previously attainable goals.” It happens gradually, before happening all at once. But long before clinical overtraining, recovery and performance can suffer through overreaching.
WHOOP monitors heart rate variability and uses it to help calculate your daily recovery, a measure of your body’s readiness to perform.
Every stress is absorbed and processed by the nervous system. It’s how we get out the door, how we respond to training, and what determines how we adapt. By accurately measuring heart rate variability, WHOOP makes it possible to monitor the nervous system to get some insight into what is actually happening in our bodies. Let’s dive into some incredibly cool WHOOP data.",4/14/22
feels-vs-facts-why-you-need-rest-days-in-training,"Feels vs Facts: Why You Still Need a Rest Day, Even When You're Feeling Good","Overuse Takes Its Toll on the Musculoskeletal System
Most injuries start as very minor changes in soft tissue or bone. At that early stage, it may actually be an adaptation stimulus–take a recovery day, come back stronger. The scary part for any lifelong athlete is that at first you might not even feel it. Being a motivated athlete is sometimes like thinking you’re running on solid ground when you’re actually on a tightrope.
From there, injuries progress down the paths we hope you don’t have to get familiar with too often. A few days off becomes a few weeks, you develop a too-close relationship with your local MRI technician, and you might even decide that pursuing your potential is not worth it. Bad knees, tibias that snap, hips that lie. It sucks, and Shakira would be disappointed.
Most injuries start as small changes in soft tissue or bone that progress with overuse.
But in way more cases than athletes sometimes think, it can be preventable. What we see in our team data with planned rest days is that they prevent the accumulation of unplanned rest weeks and months. However, even if you’re a lucky, beautiful genetic outlier that never gets injured, the same rationale is essential for adapting to hard training.
Here’s one of our favorite studies of all time. A 2016 case study in the journal Physiology Reports looked at daily measurements of numerous blood counts, including creatine kinase as a proxy for muscle damage. If an athlete showed abnormal deviations, training was reduced. Running economy improved significantly in the athletes that were adding downtime in response to cellular-level processes that they often didn’t even perceive.

The purpose is to help you better understand these feelings by grounding them in science.
Imagine this: You’re training hard each day, and you feel like you should keep going. That’s what it takes, right? But even though you feel ready to go, your coach is telling you to take a day off. Why?
One of our main goals as coaches is to bring the discussion about rest days into alignment with the science of rest days. Athletes often view rest as an empty space, a pause, or even a step back. In reality, consistent rest and recovery days are opportunities to take massive leaps forward, spurring adaptation from the cellular level all the way up to how our nervous systems integrate stresses from training and life.
Training without adaptation is breakdown. And much too often, the world of endurance sports sees “strong training” when it’s actually looking at something more like “slow-burn self-destruction.”
Athletes often view rest days as a step back, but In reality they’re opportunities to take massive leaps forward.
OK, we know that’s a provocative thing to say, but in coaching athletes from beginners to pros the strongest predictor of long-term growth amongst similarly-situated athletes is an ability to adapt to the work they are doing. What might we be seeing? It’s likely tied to how chronic stress impacts the endocrine system, musculoskeletal system, and nervous system, mixed with individual genetic variation.

Field Trip Health, a leader in the development and delivery of psychedelic therapies, and WHOOP today announced a partnership whereby Field Trip will be using the WHOOP Strap 3.0 to measure biometric effects of psychedelic therapies.
Field Trip, which is opening Field Trip Health centers across North America and Europe for the delivery of psychedelic therapies, plans to conduct an observational study to assess whether ketamine-assisted therapies, which have demonstrated significant efficacy in treating mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety and PTSD, translate into improvements in physical health through a variety of biometric measures collected via the WHOOP Strap 3.0 including heart rate variability (HRV), resting heart rate, and overall sleep quality.
“The clinical results from our first three centers in Toronto, New York and Los Angeles, as determined by validated mental health measures, have been extremely positive. We have noted a significant reduction in depressive symptoms from severe or moderately severe to mild or non-existent, along with reduction in anxiety and trauma related symptoms,” said Dr. Ryan Yermus, Field Trip’s Chief Clinical Officer. He added:
“Through this partnership with WHOOP and the observational study we will be conducting, we expect to find that these improvements in mental health correlated strongly to improvements in a person’s biometrics as well.”",11/19/20

Studies have demonstrated that physiological metrics such as HRV and slow wave sleep patterns are correlated with improved health outcomes. The parties anticipate that the effects of Field Trip’s psychedelic therapies will improve these key metrics and this study is expected to advance the understanding of correlation between mental health and physiology.
Kristen Holmes, WHOOP Vice President of Performance Science, commented: “Through our initial work with SEAL Future Foundation, we were able to show that psilocybin and ayahuasca therapies had profoundly positive effects on the physiology of veteran SEALs. With this program at Field Trip, which is offering legal treatment with psychedelic therapies across North America and Europe, we hope to be part of the healing of a much larger group of people, and further show that 24/7 health monitoring by WHOOP technology can help people take control of their overall well-being when used in association with new mental and emotional health therapies.”
“At Field Trip, our mission is to bring the world to life through psychedelics and psychedelic-enhanced therapies,” said Ronan Levy, Field Trip’s Executive Chairman. “Through this partnership with WHOOP, we hope to demonstrate that our work not only changes the mental and emotional well-being of people, it also tangible and meaningfully gets expressed through their physical well-being as well.”

The 48-year-old has been a fireman for 18 years, but athletics is his true calling. “Back in the day I was a bodybuilder,” Rob told WHOOP. “When I was 24, I underwent a congenital heart surgery. I had an ablation, a procedure where they go in through your femoral artery with these very thin catheters and map out your heart. I had two AV (atrioventricular) nodes removed that were disrupting my heart rate.”
“After the surgery, my thinking was that I should be doing more cardio workouts to strengthen my heart, so I got into road cycling,” Rob said. “That started my whole cardio journey. I went from 205 pounds to 160 pounds in just a few months.” Rob has been a dedicated cyclist ever since.
“A few years ago, I converted from a road dude to mountain biking when I saw an elite race for the first time,” he said. “It had such a cool vibe, I loved the camaraderie and I dug the grittiness of it. I sold my road bike and went all in.”
In what little spare time he has left over, Rob is also a coach and trainer: “I always loved training. Twenty years ago, I started out as a strength trainer, then I became a certified cycling coach. When I joined the fire department, helping fellow firefighters was a natural fit. Eventually I became the fitness coordinator for the entire Los Angeles County fire department, one of the largest in the country.”",7/7/17

However, he clearly brings great levels of passion and intensity to everything he does: “I show people my WHOOP activity log and they ask why I’m exercising at 3 am, ‘No man, that’s just my work,’ I say. We work 24-hour shifts. Reviewing my data the morning after each shift is a huge eye opener. I’ve learned how much the Strain from waking up and running 911 calls in the middle of the night is costing my next day Recovery.”
Here’s a look at Rob’s heart rate and Sleep during a typical night at the firehouse. On this occasion, he woke up five different times for a total of 2:04 of the 9:06 he attempted to Sleep:
Last winter, Rob suffered a left-sided inguinal hernia while “lifting a 600-pound patient into an ambulance.” A short time later, he bought his WHOOP Strap. He had surgery to repair the hernia on January 31st and was determined to get back to racing as soon possible. “I wanted WHOOP to guide my rehab,” Rob said. “My plan was to train as hard as I could when I was recovered, and take the days off when I wasn’t. Typically I’d be a hammerhead and train through it, but I decided I didn’t want to be recovering from surgery and recovering from workouts too.”
On February 9th, just over a week after his operation, Rob got back on the bike–an indoor stationary bicycle, per doctor’s orders. He rode for 10 minutes, recording a Strain of 4.2 (the Strain of his workouts appears in blue below):
It was a little more than he could handle, so when Rob tried again on Saturday February 11th, he kept his workout Strain to a 0.5. He then followed that up with a 4.1 on February 14th before easing back into more strenuous workouts on February 17, when he awoke that morning with a 93% Recovery:",7/7/17

It helped me to pace myself and get out of the athlete mentality of ‘don’t complain, get up and do your training, do what you’ve got to do on the calendar.’ I rested more and decided to start just taking what my body gave me, which allowed me to progress much quicker than I had expected. Within 8-9 weeks, I was back to racing.”
On April 9th, Rob competed in his first race since the injury, finishing 14th overall in the Bonelli Park U.S. Kenda Cup #3 Race Series in San Dimas, California.
“WHOOP lets you see if you’re jumping back in too soon and tells you your current readiness,” Rob noted. “It helped me pace myself to maximize Recovery. Otherwise, I totally would’ve overtrained and I wouldn’t have been able to make my race.”
On race day, during which he registered a 17.5 Strain while competing and a 20.5 overall Day Strain, Rob was 91% Recovered:
Being the driven competitor that he is, Rob casually mentioned that he still didn’t quite feel back to normal at that time. However, less than a month later, he finished 2nd in his age group and placed 3rd overall at an Xterra Renegade Off-Road Duathlon, a race consisting of two 3-mile trail runs and a 15-mile mountain bike ride.

I have been an instructor with obé fitness for nearly 4 years, and what I truly adore about teaching on this platform is the variety of modalities in which I get to lead our members–from trampoline classes and intense HIIT sessions, to boxing and powerlifting. Not only is every week’s programming different, but teaching 3-4 days a week means every day’s workout and strain is different.
Now here’s the thing: We aren’t just coaching and cueing our members at obé, we are also performing the workout in real-time with them, and going (as we like to say) “All In, Full Out!”
Obviously teaching effectively is my job, but it is also my personal responsibility as a coach to make sure I can bring my “A-game” with both programming and physical performance. Every. Single. Class.
Melody can reach strains of 18+ (on a 0-21 scale) on days when her only activity is coaching.
So, as an athlete and a coach, I had to use my WHOOP to constantly adjust my daily fitness load, even if that meant deviating from my marathon prep plan. If my long run was scheduled for Monday but I had to teach on a Tuesday, and I woke up Monday morning with my WHOOP showing me in the red, that long run becomes a short recovery run or complete rest day. As you can see from my WHOOP data, teaching creates just as much strain as a functional strength session, so I adapted to make sure I could perform at that level. But also…",5/12/22

As any parent or caretaker can tell you, raising a child is taxing on so many different levels. Managing schedules, constant communication with teachers/parents/coaches/classmates, making sure they remember to eat or go to the bathroom or take their medicine… All of these are regular concerns, and all of these can sap your energy more than a HIIT workout on any given day.
Melody with her daughter after completing a long training run.
My amazing daughter is currently 7 years old, full of energy, and on the autism spectrum. While every day may provide different victories and struggles, successes and challenges, the constant factor is always making sure there is enough in my tank to support her needs. In general, tasks that involve physical demands (long walks, subway stairs, new or overwhelming environments) will require additional exertion. A walk through Central Park may require her to be given shoulder rides or piggy-backs. We’re regularly squatting, hinging, pressing our way through daily activities to help her feel as supported as possible.
So, how do I best manage my exertion to successfully live in all 3 roles simultaneously?
“Mom days” can be very strenuous as well, and require high-quality sleep and recovery.",5/12/22
fitness-instructor-being-better-coach-athlete-mom,"Fitness Instructor Shares How WHOOP Helps Her Be a Better Coach, Athlete & Mom","I AM AN ATHLETE
I started using WHOOP as my primary activity tracker at the beginning of 2021. Coming out of pandemic-induced lockdowns and great changes in my training schedule and circumstances, I was looking for a resource to help me step up my fitness game, as well as guide my sleep and recovery in this new era of existing. Things like a hybrid work environment, random intervals of remote schooling for my daughter, and general covid anxiety were certainly impacting my sleep schedule!
By summer of last year I decided I needed additional motivation to help me feel my strongest as an individual competitor, so I signed up to train for the NYC Marathon (the race was a fundraiser to support my daughters’ school, which will make more sense by point No. 3). I have always been an avid sprinter, but this was my first foray into distance running and I needed all the support I could get!
When she began training for a marathon, Melody’s daily recoveries took an immediate hit.
Gradually, my WHOOP data variables began to fluctuate as my race training progressed. Longer runs led to higher strain, increased fatigue, and greater need for recovery periods. During my first official month of marathon prep, I noticed my recovery trended towards the yellow zone (and in many instances, lived in a constant state of red!) Prior to this boost in training intensity, I hadn’t seen such a dip in my daily recovery, which clued me in to the fact that adjustments needed to be made in my overall strategy. While my body naturally adapted to fatigue over time, race training was not the only element I had to factor into my plan…",5/12/22

I am also a fitness coach and programming manager at obé fitness. And, most importantly to me, I am a mother. Like many other individuals, the notion of “wearing multiple hats” and attempting to wear them all with equal amounts of ability is not a foreign concept.
However, these three roles that are a crucial part of what makes me tick also require something that has to be measured and analyzed accordingly: Physical performance. This is where using my WHOOP has been an invaluable tool–tracking not only my strain but also sleep and recovery while assisting me in constantly “leveling up” my execution of all three roles.",5/12/22

Yes, super glamorous, oh-so-important data. My WHOOP has become my own personal trainer and wellness coach. When my recovery or sleep is low, I know that I need to adapt my personal sessions as an athlete first, so that I can then teach classes for our obé members at full capacity and still have energy left to serve as “Mom” throughout the day.
Off day from teaching and my recovery is in the green? You’d better believe that is when I fit in my 10-mile training run or a big day out in Manhattan with my kiddo.
Confession time: I have been burnt out, drained physically, and still tried to push through. I have seen my recovery in the red, running on fumes and minimal sleep, and yet attempted to complete training runs, instruct class, and somehow stay awake to snuggle my daughter at the end of the day. It. Does. Not. Work.
Each night the WHOOP SLEEP COACH recommends an ideal bed time in order to achieve optimal sleep.
Every day I get a little bit wiser. I learn to plan ahead (including going to bed when my WHOOP reminds me!) and adjust my strategy based on feedback from the app. I can truthfully say I am a much better performer all around because of it. As a Mother. A Coach. And an Athlete.

We caught up with Nicole Gibbs the Wednesday before the Super Bowl. As she concluded an on-court practice session, she discussed a plan for the days ahead with her training partner.
“Let’s do a similar thing tomorrow, then take Friday off and see how your body responds,” he said. “We don’t want to have any soreness.” Nicole suggested she’d like to workout Saturday and Sunday morning, but then have a fun a “Super Bowl Day.”
“We’ll see about Monday, maybe a light Monday, and then hit it hard after that,” she said. “That way I can enjoy myself a little bit on Sunday. I’ll do what my WHOOP says on Monday morning. Or I might have to take it off so coach Mike doesn’t see my data. I do that sometimes [laughing], ‘I’m like oh yeah, weird, I didn’t wear it all weekend. So weird how that happens, so weird how I didn’t have it charged.’ Then Mike will text me and just be like ‘WHOOP?’”
Mike Guevara, known as “Coach Mike G,” is an elite performance trainer who Nicole employs as a fitness consultant. The two live on separate sides of the country, but Mike checks in on her WHOOP data on a daily basis via the coaching dashboard in the app.
“I started working with Nicole online to implement various strategies to help her recover from injury, try different approaches to nutrition, and to figure out a sleep solution for her because she wasn’t sleeping too well,” Mike said. “And whenever I’m in town or we’re in the same area, we work together hands on.”

for-pro-tennis-player-nicole-gibbs-balance-is-key-to-recovery,"For Pro Tennis Player Nicole Gibbs, Balance is Key to Recovery","SHIFTING FOCUS IN 2017
Last year, Nicole struggled with nagging injuries to begin her 2017 season. “I was having cartilage erosion issues with my right knee,” she said. “I’d been limping through a couple months of matches where I wasn’t performing my best and I was really frustrated with the way my body was feeling. Then after a swing of tournaments in March, I had a practice where I hit two balls and my wrist just gave out. It was super painful and I couldn’t even hit another ball. Now I had both my right knee and my right wrist out of commission. My coach and I sat down and looked at each other and decided ‘OK, this is not going to do it.’”
Nicole says it was in that moment that her outlook shifted.
“The silver lining to those injuries was that they got me thinking differently about the sport,” she recalled. “More about how I can make my career a long and sustainable one. I changed my focus and made health my No. 1 priority moving forward, which I think will have great effects for me in terms of longevity.”
The first thing she did was hire a full-time fitness trainer to ensure she was taking proper care of herself on a daily basis. “We started bringing on a lot of recovery technology,” Nicole said. “We got NormaTec boots to enhance blood flow, we got Marc Pro for flushing the system after strenuous workouts, and we also got WHOOP.”
Ever since she began wearing a Strap last spring, WHOOP has played a key role in helping Nicole stay on the court. “I always want to feel like I’ve done everything I can to put myself in the best position to win,” she told us. “But ironically there’s a tipping point for that, going above and beyond only works up to a certain point. WHOOP shows me when I’ve trained just enough and my effort is worth it, or when I’m doing too much and my effort is detrimental to what I’m trying to accomplish. It allows me to find the balance between pushing myself to that next level, and protecting myself to be able to compete at that level.”",3/21/18
for-pro-tennis-player-nicole-gibbs-balance-is-key-to-recovery,"For Pro Tennis Player Nicole Gibbs, Balance is Key to Recovery","“UNCONVENTIONAL” PATH TO BECOMING A PRO
“I guess I didn’t really ever choose tennis,” Nicole confessed. “My dad started me when I was about three years old. He’d been a college player and was kind of the tennis version of a struggling artist. He really wanted to pass on the legacy of it to the next generation of his family, so he did everything in his power to make me an athlete. I think that’s honestly been amazing for me.”
Despite having tennis thrust upon her, Nicole has always made her own choices when it comes to her development in the sport. “A lot of players, especially the ones who are really good at a young age, their parents will encourage them to home school,” she said. “I was many times encouraged to do it myself, but that was never really authentic to who I was as a person. I was always juggling trying to be successful on the court with trying to be successful in the classroom. It was challenging, but ultimately shaped me into someone who was prepared to go to Stanford.”
And while most world-class players turn pro straight from high school, Nicole went to Stanford for three years (where she won two NCAA championships in singles and one in doubles) before making the jump:
“I needed more time to develop and become a fuller person and athlete. I definitely pride myself in trying to pave my own path. We all know how hard it is to make it in sports. I think the more you can do to have a balanced childhood, the better off you’ll be as you mature and get older.”",3/21/18
for-pro-tennis-player-nicole-gibbs-balance-is-key-to-recovery,"For Pro Tennis Player Nicole Gibbs, Balance is Key to Recovery","NOT IN THE GREEN?
Red Recoveries are a rarity for Nicole, but when they do happen, she almost always knows why. Sometimes they’re caused by the inevitably difficult travel schedule of a pro tennis player (although she claims to be a champion at avoiding jet lag):
“I’m away from home about 50% of the time, so half of the year I’m traveling. It can be anywhere from just down the road in Palm Springs, or Australia, or South America. We’re definitely plane hoppers in tennis. It has its benefits, you get to see the world. But, it can also be really challenging to get yourself into a performance-ready state week after week on different continents. I honestly am an excellent traveler at this point in my life though, I’ve gotten really good at sleeping on planes in economy. Obviously you’re never going to get a perfect night’s sleep when you’re traveling, but I’ve found that as long as I take the routines from home and bring them on the road with me, I can usually find really restful recovery periods.”
Take a look at her Sleep data prior to the 2018 Australian Open:
More often than not, Nicole’s occasional poor Recoveries are the result of specific choices she’s made. “Normally if I’m in the red, I feel like I’ve done it to myself,” she told us. “If I don’t give myself enough time to sleep, or maybe if I stay out late or have a few drinks with friends, that’s the kind of thing that’s going to put me in the red next day. We all have our moments where we want to have fun and unwind a little bit, that’s totally fine in its place. But for the most part, within three weeks of competition, I’m never going to have a red day.”
Below is a sample of Nicole’s Strain (blue) and Recovery (green and yellow) heading into a tournament in China at the beginning of the year:
“ It’s really encouraging for me when I wake up and I see my Recovery in the green. That means I’ve checked all of the boxes that I can to be prepared for that event. ”",3/21/18
for-pro-tennis-player-nicole-gibbs-balance-is-key-to-recovery,"For Pro Tennis Player Nicole Gibbs, Balance is Key to Recovery","RECOVERY = BALANCE, PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY
That balance Nicole spoke of is a crucial aspect of her recovery process. “Outside of the obvious things like treating your body well, making sure you ice bath or get a massage after a challenging day, recovery for me means balance,” she theorized. “Doing things off the court that take your mind off of tennis. Stuff like hanging out with friends, going to the movies, those are all really undervalued parts of recovery.”
“I feel very fortunate to have what I have at home,” Nicole added, “including an incredible group of friends who have no idea about tennis, at all. That sounds funny, but it’s nice to be around people who don’t value you for what you’re doing professionally. The more I mature with the sport, the more I realize things you do to counteract what you’re doing athletically are as important as what you’re actually doing on the court or in the gym.”
Nicole also noted the significance of psychological recovery, something often overlooked by many elite athletes:
“As a tennis player, your emotional state or your mental state profoundly affects your ability to compete. In a match, losing a disappointing point and having to rebound and play the next point 30 seconds later, or having the fortitude to play match after match, your emotional and mental stability is really paramount. One of the things I’ve found quite valuable with my WHOOP data is that it maps pretty perfectly not only to my physical well being, but also to how I’m feeling mentally and emotionally.”
Nicole uses this to her advantage to maximize the effectiveness of her training. “You have days when you don’t feel your best physically, and so you might tailor your workout to that. But, what you don’t necessarily account for are the changes in your mood that can come from taking on too much strain in a given week,” she said.

for-pro-tennis-player-nicole-gibbs-balance-is-key-to-recovery,"For Pro Tennis Player Nicole Gibbs, Balance is Key to Recovery","Having someone who holds her accountable is also a major factor when it comes to being properly recovered. “Coach Mike G is 100% dialed in on my Recovery levels every single day,” Nicole said. “He’ll ask me if it’s low, ‘What happened?’ or ‘Why didn’t you sleep eight hours?” He’s very thorough in checking in to see that I’m crossing the ‘T’s and dotting the ‘I’s with my Recovery, making sure I’m getting enough sleep, making sure I’m eating right. That’s all a huge priority for him.”
We asked Mike how he felt about Nicole’s philosophy regarding the importance of having balance in her life in order to maintain success:
“What makes one great athlete tick is not always going to be the same for others,” he said. “I think that mental well being and psychological strategy is very, very important in regards to how we as coaches can meet athletes half way when it comes to training. If an athlete is not in a good position mentally, whether it’s through practice, competing, whatever, they’ll never earn the type of recovery or adaptation that we’re trying to implement in the first place.”
“That’s where the balance of life comes into play,” Mike continued. “From time to time I’ll say things to Nicole like ‘Go out to dinner, avoid red meat, but have a glass of wine or a beer or two.’ For her, to read those words in a text message or hear them from my voice, it not only makes her happy, it lets her understand that I’m trying to collaborate with her. At the end of the day, psychological and mental well being are just as important as all the other factors, I think that’s what she means by balance.”",3/21/18
for-pro-tennis-player-nicole-gibbs-balance-is-key-to-recovery,"For Pro Tennis Player Nicole Gibbs, Balance is Key to Recovery","“If I wake up and see that my WHOOP Recovery is low, I’ll usually try to incorporate more mindfulness, meditation or yoga into my routine. That way I’m able to have a more constructive practice, as opposed to getting out there and feeling groggy, maybe being moody or impatient with my coach. I’ve found that those things positively influence my relationships with my team too–‘Warning, my Recovery is not great today, be patient with me!’ I also recognize that I have to be patient with myself and make sure that I’m being kind to everyone around me, which is not always easy when you’re tired and training hard.”",3/21/18
for-pro-tennis-player-nicole-gibbs-balance-is-key-to-recovery,"For Pro Tennis Player Nicole Gibbs, Balance is Key to Recovery","“The thing is, we don’t know for sure if any of these strategies work unless we have objective data.” Mike explained. “I’ve been using WHOOP for a while now, as soon as Nicole and I decided to start working together, that was one of the requirements, I needed her to get a WHOOP. It allows me to guess and check the specific methods that we’re implementing. For example, in regards to sleep hygiene–creating the right sleep environment, blackout curtains, chamomile tea before bed, hot baths before bed, magnesium salts, etc.–what stuff works for her? Which actionable techniques create positive feedback in her WHOOP data?”
“I was for sure skeptical at first,” Nicole said. “I thought ‘It’s like a Fitbit? Isn’t that for pilates ladies?’ But Mike swore by it and he’d had so much success using WHOOP with other athletes. As soon as I started wearing it I was just blown away by how in-depth the data was and how much I could derive from it–how accurately it quantified what I was feeling. That really drove our emphasis on recovery.”
“We devise programs that are appropriate to my WHOOP Recovery levels,” Nicole elaborated. “If I’m in the green and we’re at a big training week, I’ll put in a ton of work that day and really go after it, make sure that I’m building my base. But if I wake up in the yellow, or worst case the red, I’ll pull back and spend less time on the court. That kind of push-pull is really important for us, to be able to put as much strain on my body as possible to build muscle mass without being destructive to what we’re doing.”",3/21/18

“From using the lessons that I learned over the course of the year, I was able to get a lot of traction towards the end of the 2017 season,” Nicole said. “By U.S. Open time, I was playing some of the best tennis of my career. I went up against the No. 1 player in the world [Karolina Pliskova] in the second round and I lost 6-4 in the third set. I won the first set and I think we were tied 3-3 in the second, so I definitely had my chances.”

Born and raised in Auckland, New Zealand, Kirsty grew up understanding patience and discipline thanks to her parents, who were professional golfers. Although she graduated with degrees in business and marketing, she knew personal training was her calling and left everything behind to pursue a career in New York City.
In her words, she’s sacrificed a lot to get to where she is today. “I’m not just here to tick days off the calendar. I really want to perform. I want to hit my peaks and so I can make really intelligent and calculated decisions about the other commitments I’m making in my life.” For Kirsty, recovery permeates every aspect of her life, not just her workouts.
Today, she trains high-profile athletes, celebrities and NYC business moguls, has founded her own line of clean protein, and collaborates with leaders in the fashion industry for athletic wear campaigns.

Joe’s nickname when he played football at UPenn was “The Ferrari”–he performed well, but was always in the shop. After years of pushing his body to extremes and trying to prove himself to coaches and peers, Joe abandoned the chip on his shoulder and developed a philosophy on health and wellness, which he calls the Ocho System.

During the 2020-2021 season, Virgil suffered a ruptured ACL that put him out of action for over 9 months. “As a football player, a knee injury is the worst that you can get. You’ve set a level and it’s about trying to get back to that level as quickly as possible.” Two-a-day rehab and training sessions became the norm, and he prioritized sleep and recovery above all else. His approach worked, and in the following season he was back in action. This season, Van Dijk has regularly hit a Strain of 19 or 20 during the preseason on double-session days, and during the season, his highest Strain scores come on match days.
## Nutrition and why he doesn’t count calories
As a professional footballer, making sure that he is fueled enough to perform at his peak is critical. He doesn’t count calories – instead, he relies on a balanced and thoughtful fueling approach. “Over the years I’ve found what’s best for my body. I only drink water, I eat veggies all of the time, and after games I make sure to eat the right foods to recover properly”. He does allow himself some flexibility as long as he primarily eats the right foods, “I enjoy food and sometimes I want to do that instead of looking at whether or not something has 200 calories.”
## The importance of consistency
Consistency is what Virgil credits with helping him perform at the top of his game. “My biggest realization was learning that every percentage of improvement can make you a better player, a better human being, or better at work.” Virgil has also helped those around him look for ways to improve. He even set up a team on the WHOOP app in order to support some younger players and teammates as they look to build consistency into their own routines.
As Virgil gears up to captain his national team at this year’s global football tournament, he is confident that he’s done everything he can to show up at his best – and we can’t wait to watch.",11/14/22
global-football-star-virgil-van-dijk-on-consistency-pre-game-naps-and-coming-back-from-injury,"Global Football Star Virgil Van Dijk on Consistency, Pre-Game Naps, and Coming Back from Injury","## Balancing Strain & Recovery During THE Season
This year for Virgil, and for other professional players, is unlike most. With a global football tournament taking place during the winter for the first time in history, it has meant that his schedule is more jam-packed than usual. For Virgil, this means managing training and the other 20+ hours of the day. “You’re playing a game every 3 days so you’re doing everything possible in order to be ready. If you’re getting that extra information, in this case from WHOOP, it’s just so beneficial. I’m addicted to looking at it in the morning and making sure that I’m doing the right stuff.”
## Why Sleep & Naps are so important
When it comes to Virgil’s recovery regimen, he relies on everything from an aquabike, to sauna, to a personal physio to stay in check – but fully recovering between successive matches can be difficult. Keeping on top of his rest and recovery has been crucial. “Knowing how to get consistently good sleep is very important. If we’re playing every three days, I need the right sleep to make sure I’m fully recovered.” Between games, travel, and evening kick-offs, establishing a routine has been challenging. Virgil is a huge proponent of naps to offset his inevitable sleep debt, especially when the team has a late afternoon or evening kick-off. “I definitely look at my Recovery score… for some when you see a red or a yellow it could get you down, but it’s about what you do with that information that matters. If I have a yellow or a red Recovery on the morning of a big game, and I know I can get another hour of sleep in, I know it can benefit me.”",11/14/22
golf-as-exercise-dave-phillips-tpi,Getting Back to Golf: A Great Form of Exercise Right Now,"What the Pros Do
Golfers have always had the stigma from other athletes that golf is not a real sport. But at the professional level, it is a far cry from the casual game played by many on weekends. If you look at the best golfers in the world today, it is hard to find one that is not focused on their physicality for an advantage. Consider the fact that WHOOP has become the go-to fitness tracker for many of the world’s best, including world No. 1 Rory McIlroy and No. 4 Justin Thomas, just to name a few.
PGA tour players walk over 300 miles in a typical season. A pro’s golf swing is a ballistic rotary activity shown to create a compressive load of up to six times body weight on the lumbar spine. It is no wonder that tracking strain and recovery is a huge factor for these athletes in maintaining a competitive advantage on the course.
## What You Should Do Before You Start Playing Golf Again
As we get back to playing golf, it’s important to take care of some areas of the body that may have atrophied from staying at home. Your body works in an alternating pattern of stable segments connected to mobile joints. Injuries can occur when joints that are usually mobile start to get tight or inhibited.
For example, video conferencing (which for many of us has become a big part of our daily lives) puts us in a sitting position that turns off our glutes, shortens our hip flexors and rounds our upper backs–key parts of the body we need for golf! If those areas are not functional when we play it adds more stress to the lower back, neck and shoulders, which is where the most common injuries happen.
Stay tuned for more in the weeks ahead about how to get your body back in playing shape, and ways to use WHOOP to help train and improve your game in the long run. And check out mytpi.com, the internet’s largest golf resource for health, fitness and understanding the mechanics of your swing.",5/29/20
golf-as-exercise-dave-phillips-tpi,Getting Back to Golf: A Great Form of Exercise Right Now,"Golf is a sport that can be played for a lifetime. It also happens to be one of the best sports for abiding by the current social distancing guidelines that will most likely be part of a new normal throughout the summer months and maybe beyond. Golf enables us to be outside and breath fresh air, as well as have safe social interaction with others in a spacious environment.
## Golf as Exercise
With golf facilities reopening around the country, you will most likely be faced with single-rider carts, or better yet, an opportunity to actually walk. Data shows that in a round of golf you can walk 4-8 miles, depending on the terrain.
Swinging a club at full speed is also great for your overall wellness. A golfer’s individual energy expenditure may be largely based on their effort, but it can provide steady to intense physical activity. In fact, the average strain on WHOOP for a round of golf is 10.6, the equivalent of a moderate cardiovascular workout for most of us.
Additionally, golf can improve things like balance, coordination, proprioception and muscle endurance. Studies have also shown that golfers have better cardiovascular health and lung function, and potentially even an increased life expectancy by up to 5 years.",5/29/20

“The workouts we did were a lot more intense about four weeks before,” Frittelli explained. “Prior to the Masters we tapered way off. That Monday I was feeling pretty good, I was ready for the weekend. Tuesday and Wednesday I did some fine tuning and loosening up, and then by Thursday I was really [ready to go]. My workouts were really light that week.”
Here’s a chart showing Frittelli’s daily strain that same month, with strain from activities (workouts) appearing in blue:
Dylan Frittelli significantly cut back his strain from workouts (blue) in the two weeks prior to the Masters.
As he mentioned, his activity strain is much higher three and four weeks out, and the blue lines begin to dip as the Masters approaches.
“My sleep before the Masters was really good too,” Frtitelli added. “I often struggle with bedtimes, but that week it was consistent.” Over the seven days leading up to it he spent 9:15 in bed per night, which translated to an average sleep time of 8:02. He also averaged an excellent 2:18 per night of REM sleep that week.",4/6/21
golf-dylan-frittelli-masters-hrv-data,Pro Golfer Dylan Frittelli’s WHOOP Data Shows He was Primed for a Peak Performance at 2020 Masters,"Green Recoveries & Missing the Cut the Week Before
A blessing in disguise for Frittelli leading into the Masters (which was played November 12-15 last year after being postponed due to COVID restrictions) was making an early exit from the previous weekend’s tournament.
“I missed the cut in Houston the Friday before, which gave me the freedom on Saturday and Sunday to get to Augusta early,” he noted. “Usually Saturday and Sunday would’ve been tournament play. I would’ve been stressed and all that, but now I had it off. I traveled early and had a longer lead up to the tournament there, I know that helped.”
“My WHOOP recovery was in the green on the Monday [before the Masters] which is very unusual for me in a tournament run, normally then it’s around 50% at best.”
A deeper dive into Frittelli’s WHOOP data tells the same story. His day strain on Saturday, November 7, was just 5.7 (on a 0-21 scale) a far cry from the typical 18-20 he’d put up playing in a late round of a tournament. His recovery that morning was 82%, then 93% Sunday and 90% on Monday.
Below is a graphic depicting Frittelli’s recovery each day over the month leading up to and during the Masters:
Dylan Frittelli’s daily WHOOP recovery was predominantly in the green heading into the Masters.
You can see above he had as many green recoveries (5) in the week of the tournament as he did spanning the three weeks prior. His highest recovery of the entire month was 94% on Wednesday, November 11, the day before the Masters began.",4/6/21

It’s abundantly clear the efforts Frittelli put in paid off when looking at his month-long trends in resting heart rate and heart rate variability.
His resting heart rate had been rising steadily for three weeks, hitting 47 beats per minute a week before the Masters. But it then began to drop considerably, and stayed steady at 38 bpm throughout the tournament:
Dylan Frittelli’s resting heart rate rose Over a period of intense training, but then improved dramatically during Masters week.
Frittelli’s HRV followed a similar path, but in the appropriate opposite direction. After falling all the way down to 76 milliseconds on Thursday November 5, it began to rise over the course of the next week, peaking at 158 ms on the Friday of the tournament:
Dylan Frittelli’s pre-Masters training regimen enabled his HRV to peak at just the right time.
With his body in prime shape to play at his best, Frittelli took on strains of 20.4, 19.4 and 20.0 over the final three days at the Masters. His recovery dipped as the tournament progressed (hitting 40% on Sunday), but it was still good enough for him to have one of the most successful results of his career.

His best showing of the 2020 season had been an eight-place finish at the RBC Heritage. However, that weekend at Augusta Frittelli shot an 11-under-par 277 to tie for fifth with Rory McIlroy.
What prompted the 30-year-old’s breakout performance on golf’s grandest stage?
Frittelli told us he’d been working on a training program with the specific goal of trying to peak at majors and other big tournaments. “We really did well this time at the Masters,” he said. “My strength and conditioning coach Nic Catterall designed a really good lead up to the event. He told me ‘You’re probably not going to play too well for the 4-5 weeks before. With the speed training we’re doing you’ll be a little tired, but I promise you when we get to the Masters you’ll be ready to go.’ He got it pretty spot on.”",4/6/21

green-2018-pro-cyclist-lawson-craddock-2,Pro Cyclist Lawson Craddock Tells his Strain & Recovery Story,"On the other hand, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. As the race progressed, I got more and more tired each day. Then the mountains came. At first I thought I was some hotshot who could compete up there, but I quickly found myself being left in the dust. That was when I realized how big a step up the Tour de France is from any other race on the calendar. I kind of got my teeth kicked in over the last week, but all that did was light a fire underneath me to be better next time.
Crossing the finish line in Paris was the highlight of my career so far. My fiancee (now my wife) and parents made the trip to France to watch the final stage, it was amazing to have them there to share it with me.
I left the 2016 Tour de France with a lot of motivation to come back in the future and turn the race upside down. I needed to be more than just a guy who hung in there, I wanted to be a guy ready to compete for glory.
In hindsight, it may have given me too much motivation heading into the next offseason.
I trained harder than I’d ever trained in my entire life. I also dieted harder than ever before. At first, it seemed like it was all working. When I hit the beginning of the 2017 season I was lighter and faster. My early results were very encouraging.
Nice to start the season off at Vuelta a Communidad Valencia. Excited to get the rest of this year started!!

Unfortunately, it didn’t last. I was ignoring all the small signs of not recovering properly, of not refueling my body properly. I had a mindset that the more tired I was, the more dead I was when I came home from training rides, the better I’d be when it was time to compete.",2/26/18
green-2018-pro-cyclist-lawson-craddock-2,Pro Cyclist Lawson Craddock Tells his Strain & Recovery Story,"I’m also remarkably lucky to have such an inspiring group of people around me. My wife, my parents, my in-laws, my friends, everyone that I keep in my close circle is extremely supportive. I think that’s really crucial to succeed in this sport.
Hopefully 10-15 years from now, when my career is over, I’ll look back at 2017 and be appreciative of what happened and the knowledge I gained from the experience. I’ve learned a lot about myself in the past year, and I believe there are many valuable lessons I can take moving forward in the next chapter of my journey.",2/26/18
green-2018-pro-cyclist-lawson-craddock-2,Pro Cyclist Lawson Craddock Tells his Strain & Recovery Story,"I’ve got big goals for the year ahead. Obviously I’d love to return to the Tour de France. I’m looking forward to seeing what WHOOP can tell me about competing there and at the other Grand Tours (Giro d’Italia and Vuelta a España). They’re unlike any other races–so much more hype, more fans, more media, a lot more stress. All of those things impact your day-to-day Strain and Recovery over the course of a grueling three weeks.
Beyond that, there are several other major races in the spring, like Pais Vasco, which is quite possibly the hardest race in the world that no one has ever heard about. I’ve had solid results there in the past and I’d love to fight for a stage win or a good overall placing in the final. The Ardennes classics and the Tour of California are events I’d love to have positive results in as well.
Most of all, I just want to be back.
Being on the world tour means a lot of time on the road, both literally and figuratively. You’re riding alone on the bike for 25 hours a week, not to mention the travel. You’ve got 70, 80, maybe 100 race days per season, most of which are in Europe. Add in travel days before and after and it’s probably 120 nights a year you’re sleeping in a hotel bed. That’s a lot of time spent away from home not putting roots in anywhere. It can be quite challenging, especially when things are going poorly and you’re not getting the results that you know you’re capable of.
Last year put a lot of things into perspective for me. I realized I was taking racing and the lifestyle for granted. When it gets taken away from you, that’s when you really start to appreciate what you have.
The fact that I get to live in Spain for part of my life with my wife is incredible. We’re so fortunate to have an apartment in Girona, which in my opinion is one of the coolest European cities there is. It’s great for training, has beautiful scenery, it’s just an amazing community.",2/26/18
green-2018-pro-cyclist-lawson-craddock-2,Pro Cyclist Lawson Craddock Tells his Strain & Recovery Story,"I was born on February 20th, 1992. I’d say my cycling life started February 21st, 1992.
I’ve been around bikes my whole life. My dad raced professional downhill way back in the day, before it was even a real thing. He was always riding recreationally when my brother and I were kids. I entered my first race when I was four years old, a local pee-wee mountain bike event.
When I was 10, I started racing competitively out at the Alkek Velodrome in Houston, TX. I raced there pretty much my entire junior career. Every year I got more and more into it. I raced internationally for the first time in Canada at age 15. A year later, I traveled to Europe as part of the U.S. national team. Ever since then, I’ve been competing internationally and progressing through the ranks of the sport.
The dream of all cyclists is to ride in the Tour de France. Growing up, it was always something I figured was just a dream. But as the years went on, it slowly became more and more realistic. I’ve been very fortunate to have the right opportunities and be put in the right places to capitalize–I had great coaches as a junior and I raced on basically the world’s best development team in Axeon Hagens Berman, led by Axel Merckx.
All of that kind of put me on this path.
In 2016, I raced the Tour de France for the first time. When I got the call saying I’d been selected for the team, I was overjoyed. But I also thought to myself, “You’ve done the easy part, now you actually have to go there and perform.”
It turns out the @letourdefrance is hard. Really hard. Glad to have the first rest day here!!
A post shared by Lawson Craddock (@lawsoncraddock) on Jul 11, 2016 at 7:05am PDT
Being there was an incredible experience. I lined up in the first stage next to one of my best friends, a guy I’d been teammates with for a long time, and we both just sat there in this surreal moment. We’d reached the pinnacle of cycling. That was really special to me.",2/26/18
green-2018-pro-cyclist-lawson-craddock-2,Pro Cyclist Lawson Craddock Tells his Strain & Recovery Story,"After a few relatively chill days, I started to notice my Recovery trending upwards. Coupled with how I was feeling, it seemed like a great time to push myself. I trained hard for several days and towards the end of the block I saw my Recoveries starting to drop. This was a good indication that I was in need of rest in order to help build fitness. From September 5th on, you can see that a few easy days helped my Recovery dramatically, a great sign that my body was ready to take on more Strain. Thankfully, I was able to pay close attention to these Recovery indicators, whereas in the past I would’ve ignored them and continued to push my body past its limits.
Having these metrics makes such a difference. When I can look in the morning and see a low Recovery (like 62% on September 7) I think, “OK, I’ve got to be better.” Then I do things like focus on being hydrated, taking a nap in the afternoon, maybe getting to bed 20 minutes earlier that night to try to hit 90% the next day.
One of the big stats I pay attention to is Sleep Performance. I think it’s really valuable to look and see how long you spend in certain stages of sleep. Typically you want at least an hour of deep sleep per night. That was something I wasn’t getting when I first started using WHOOP.
I keep a close eye on my HRV (heart rate variability) and resting heart rate as well. For example, I may say to myself “Hmm, my RHR is higher than normal today, what’s factoring into that? Am I fatigued? Am I sick?” I also like to see how certain training regimens and nutrition habits can affect my HRV.
When I started doing all of these things and paying attention to my body more, I really began noticing a difference. Ever since then I haven’t had any issues. Unfortunately, there wasn’t enough time for me to get back to my standards in 2017, but it’s setting me up to be primed to perform in 2018.",2/26/18
green-2018-pro-cyclist-lawson-craddock-2,Pro Cyclist Lawson Craddock Tells his Strain & Recovery Story,"As the season wore on, I started to notice that things weren’t quite right, both mentally and physically. I was really crabby all the time, kind of short with everyone. I never wanted to leave the apartment and I was no longer able to train hard like I used to. I’d go to races and be one of the first guys dropped. After all the work I’d put in, I couldn’t believe what was going on.
I got stuck in a downward spiral for the rest of the year. I’d think that I could push myself, I’d try to do too much too soon, and next thing I knew I was right back where I started. For every two steps forward, I ended up taking three steps back.
2017 was really just a disastrous year for me on the bike. I needed something to get me out of the funk I was in. At a race one day, I noticed our team doctor wearing a band on his wrist that I’d never seen before. I asked him a bunch of questions about it, and he told me how it tracks your daily Strain, Sleep and Recovery. I thought “Wow, this would’ve been really beneficial to me last season.” Shortly afterwards, I reached out to WHOOP and they sent me a Strap.
Almost from that exact point on, things started to shift back in the right direction for me. Right from the start, WHOOP helped me break the cycle of overtraining.

While the assessment is not 100% conclusive, a notable relationship may allow you to infer a correlation based on the concrete physiological data collected via WHOOP. Over time, and with continued experimentation, patterns may emerge in the monthly assessment that give you clear insights into what behaviors are driving WHOOP metrics.

guide-to-self-experimentation-whoop-journal,Reducing Uncertainty: The Guide to Self-Experimentation,"As a high performance coach and athlete, I’ve always been interested in amplifying behaviors associated with sustained levels of motivation, perseverance, and innovation. In my experience, “performance,” whether we want to accept it or not, is largely a choice. We choose behaviors that support performance, or we choose behaviors that hurt performance. If we want to sustain performance, then it’s necessary to understand our physiological and psychological variables that ultimately influence our physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health, so we can manage them over time. With the new WHOOP Journal feature, WHOOP gives you the opportunity to see how these variables truly affect your performance, so you can conduct your own self-experiment. In this article, my goal is to define how WHOOP Members can apply the scientific method to the WHOOP Journal as a guide to self-experimentation.
“Experimental Life” As a Way of Being
We all adapt to training, food, stress (you name it!) differently. One approach is not going to fit all. Self-experimentation can be a way to better understand your optimal set points and behaviors. For example, controlled mini experiments help us isolate the impact an old or new behavior might have on our physiological and psychological processes.",3/12/20
guide-to-self-experimentation-whoop-journal,Reducing Uncertainty: The Guide to Self-Experimentation,"One thing I realized very quickly when trying to optimize my own performance is that while the variables are quite universal, my response to these inputs differs greatly depending on my behaviors. Self-experimentation is an excellent way to hone in your optimal set points and behaviors. Instead of typical scientific experiments that have a number of research subjects, self-experiment is just you, and you are in control. Over the last 4 years, I’ve run a lot of mini experiments with clients/athletes on the WHOOP platform as well as with myself. These experiments have lasted anywhere from 1-4 weeks and many of them have resulted in transformational improvements in mental, physical, and emotional well-being.
In this post, I’ll talk about:
1. How to Form An Experimental Question:
Using the WHOOP Journal: Come up with your experiment title based on the behaviors listed in the WHOOP Journal. Commit to filling out your journal each day with the selection you’ve made.
2. How to Determine the Evaluation Criteria
Using the WHOOP Journal: Choose the variable you want to monitor over the next 30 days. It may be helpful to start your experiment on the first day of the month, that way when you receive your Monthly Performance Assessment, all of your data will be in a single report. Stick to a regimen and do not deviate.
3. Experimental Conditions
Using the WHOOP Journal: You can track other valuable experimental conditions within the categories of lifestyle, nutrition, bedtime routines, and more.
4. How to Identify/Control Confounding Factors
Using the WHOOP Journal: Pay attention to the timing of your activities, which you can log in the journal. Overall, it’s up to you to be aware of confounding factors that may influence your WHOOP data. If you change your routine, you can make a note of this in your WHOOP Journal for future recollection.

Gym Jones started in Salt Lake City, Utah in 2003, working with a small group of martial artists, climbers and military. A few years later, in 2007, they trained the cast of the movie 300. Watching the cast develop a bond and respect for each before shooting began, Gym Jones realized the value of these relationships. Their fundamental training philosophy is that the mind is primary, and we should use the gym to build from the inside out.
Over the past 15+ years, Gym Jones has worked with military contracts, professional athletes, Warner Brothers and Sony Pictures, as well as the general population at large. Their 8,000-square-foot facility outside Salt Lake City serves as a training place for local members and the testing grounds for all their programs and methodologies, which are available online to members all over the world.
“We believe in providing a supportive atmosphere that teaches you to take ownership, execute to the highest standards and conquer fear and self-doubt.”
The Gym Jones approach to training enables you to push beyond your mental and physical barriers. They define fitness as “the ability to do a task,” and one size does not fit all. Training programs should follow a progression:
Needs Analysis: What is your objective? Testing: Where are you in relation to your goal? Program Design: Map out the training necessary to get from where you are to where you want to be.

In winning a record fifth team championship, the members of Mayhem Freedom (Rich Froning, Chase Hill, Andrea Nisler and Taylor Williamson) accomplished a number of other CrossFit Games first as well.
On Day 1, Mayhem Freedom won all 4 events, the only squad ever to do that. Collectively the team members’ average recovery that morning was in the green at 67%. They averaged an 18.0 day strain, and to no surprise their spectacular achievements had a huge impact on their WHOOP stats the following morning.
For Day 2, their average HRV slipped from 110 to 76, and recovery was nearly in the red at 34%.
Daily WHOOP recovery and strain averages for Team Mayhem Freedom while winning a fifth CrossFit Games title.
An average strain of “only” 15.7 on Day 2 helped boost the team’s recovery to 47% for Day 3, and it stayed there for Day 4.
Mayhem Freedom continued to break records, winning 8 of the Games’ 13 total events and capturing the title by 219 points, the greatest-ever margin of victory over a second-place finisher.
Team Mayhem Freedom, Rich Froning, Chase Hill, Andrea Nisler and Taylor Williamson, won 8 of the CrossFit Games’ 13 events.
On the Monday following the completion of the Games, the Mayhem Freedom teammates’ WHOOP numbers were indicative of pushing themselves to the limits for four straight days, and potentially enjoying some quality time to celebrate afterwards.
Their average HRV was down to 60, while resting heart rate (49 bpm on Day 1) was up to 56 bpm. Combined with just a 66% sleep performance (average of 5 hours and 54 minutes), and the teams’ recovery the day after winning the CrossFit Games was a well-earned 20%.

The day before the Games began, Haley Adams awoke with a green WHOOP recovery of 74%. Her heart rate variability (HRV) was 112 milliseconds, and her resting heart rate (RHR) was 48 beats per minute. Her body was in great shape to take on the world’s best.
The day before the Games began, Haley Adams’ WHOOP data indicated she was primed for a peak performance.
Haley’s day strain on the eve of the Games was also only 5.9 on our 0-21 scale, meaning she took great strides to give her body adequate rest heading into four days of intense competition.
Her top event finish was on Day 2, in which she took second place in the handstand walk obstacle course. Check out this WHOOP Live video featuring her real-time heart rate:

Will we begin to see a return to normalcy in 2021? What will fitness and wellness look like in a (hopefully) post-COVID world? Are there trends from 2020 that are here to stay?
Here are some insights from WHOOP Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer John Capodilupo:
“One of the most significant behavior changes we noticed from physical distancing due to COVID-19 was a prioritization of sleep. As the population has become more and more conscious of the benefits of sleep, I believe people in 2021 will take a more proactive role in knowing how behaviors and products can impact sleep. In particular, things like sleep consistency, which is more easily in a person’s control than increasing REM, etc.
I also think that wearables, and WHOOP specifically, have shown how important understanding your physiological baseline is. I predict this is the start of a major trend where we will finally accumulate and analyze lots of granular data at the individual level. Over the course of the next few years, better preventive medicine, empowered by individuals themselves, will come to light.”

### Strain Norms
The average day strain for all WHOOP members in 2020 was 10.7 (on a scale of 0-21). This was actually down significantly from 2019, when it was 11.5. Unlike many of the other stats to follow, we actually don’t suspect this is an effect of COVID-19 and people spending much of the year staying home. Instead, it’s more likely a result of the WHOOP member base growing and expanding rapidly beyond athletes to the general population at large.
In the US, strain peaked in the months of May and June, with averages of just over 11 per day. People took on the least strain in December (10.3 average), which is something we’ve seen in years past as well.
### Strain Changes
However, the most notable activity and fitness trends in 2020 were not related to the amount our members exercised, but rather the type of workouts they did. The chart below shows the percentage of all activities logged on WHOOP represented by walking, running, cycling, weightlifting and functional fitness, in both 2019 and 2020:
So for example, in 2019 running accounted for 8.9% of all activities. But in 2020, that number jumped up to 13%. You can see that individual forms of exercise which require little or no equipment (quarantine-friendly workouts), including walking and cycling as well, increased significantly in 2020.
On the other hand, weightlifting and functional fitness, which often take place in gyms, both decreased. Weightlifting in particular saw the biggest drop off in April and May (only 2.7% of WHOOP activities) during the height of lockdown.",1/11/21
health-fitness-data-trends-2020,Health & Fitness Trends in 2020 Seen in WHOOP Data,"Sleep: Changes in Behavior
### More Sleep
On average, WHOOP members slept 2,054 more minutes in 2020 than they did in 2019 (actually it was 2,472, but we accounted for 2020 being a leap year and having an extra day). It was a little more than 34 hours in total, roughly 6 minutes per night: 6:58 vs. 6:52.
Whether it was no longer getting up early to commute to work, fewer opportunities to go out late at night, or possibly just a lack of other activity choices, WHOOP members began sleeping more when the pandemic took hold (mid March).
Below we display the average hours of sleep per night in the US in January, February, March and April of 2020:
### Best Sleep
The night we slept the most in 2020 was the evening of December 25, an average of 7.44 hours. The second-best night of sleep for WHOOP members (7.38) was when daylight savings went into effect, giving us an extra hour early in the morning on November 1 (more on both of these in the recovery section to follow).
### Worst Sleep
We regularly find that New Year’s Eve is the night people sleep the least, and generally by a wide margin. But in 2020, there was another that rivaled it–November 3, election night. The average WHOOP member woke up on November 4 having slept about half an hour less than they normally do.",1/11/21
health-fitness-data-trends-2020,Health & Fitness Trends in 2020 Seen in WHOOP Data,"Recovery: Highs and Lows
### Good Recoveries
April was the month in 2020 when US members had the highest average daily recovery, 61%. That makes sense considering the increase in sleep from March into April. We saw the highest average heart rate variability (HRV, a valuable performance indicator and key component of WHOOP recovery) in the summertime, just over 65 ms in June, July and August. This aligns nicely with the increase in strain noted above in May and June–people working out more in late spring led to better overall fitness in the summer.
### Bad Recoveries
HRV hit its low December (US average of 59.4 ms), which coincides with it being the month when people were least active.
The single worst average recovery day in 2020 was 50% on January 1, no surprise. The next lowest was 52% on July 5, predictable as well. Also 52% was November 1, which is quite surprising considering it was one of the nights WHOOP members got the most sleep. Apparently the aftereffects of Halloween were too much to be fixed by some additional time sleeping.
Christmas day marked one of the poorest average recoveries as well, at 53%. Factors like social time with family the evening before, or getting up extra early with the kids in the morning, likely contributed (and explain why people slept so much that night afterwards).
Outdoing all of these though, was January 1, 2021:

A short story about my father’s health exemplifies the power of the “always on” philosophy.
In July 2020 after my father joined WHOOP, he noticed his respiratory rate increasing. A few days later, he was experiencing shortness of breath during exercise, a common symptom of a respiratory tract infection. Deciding to seek medical attention, he braced himself for what he was sure was a COVID-19 infection, but multiple tests came back negative.
Respiratory rate and resting heart rate trends displayed in the new WHOOP health report.
For weeks my father bounced between doctors–his primary care physician, the local hospital, and a pulmonary specialist. The doctors acknowledged his symptoms were significant and were therefore confused when pulmonary function tests came back within the population “normal” range. Knowing his data was not normal for him, he pushed for more answers. It wasn’t until he had a CT scan in September that a doctor recognized signs of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, a rare viral disease that can cause severe damage if left untreated. Several rounds of steroids later, my father was exercising again and his WHOOP respiratory rate had returned to his baseline from nearly six months before.
The Health Monitor lets members know when physiological metrics deviate from their own normal range. This can help people understand their overall state of health and wellness in a personalized way, not just compared to averages over millions of people.

heart-rate-recovery,Heart Rate Recovery: Why it's a Sign of Fitness & How to Improve it,"What is a Good Heart Rate Recovery Time?
A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine of nearly 2500 adults over a 6-year time frame observed that “the median value for heart rate recovery was 17 beats per minute, with a range from the 25th to the 75th percentile of 12 to 23 beats per minute.” However, the average age of the participants was also 57 years old, and HRR has been found to decrease around age 60.
Another study from 2015 tested 274 elite male athletes. Those over the age of 18 had an average 1-minute HRR of 29.5, compared to 22.4 for subjects under 18.
One thing to note is that not only does heart rate recovery vary from person to person, it can also fluctuate for you from day to day. A 2016 case study entitled The Science and Application of Heart Rate Recovery examined the HRR of runners post-workout in relation to their daily WHOOP recovery (how ready your body is to perform). Across the board, the athletes had faster heart rate recovery times on days when their WHOOP recoveries were higher.
## How Can I Improve My Heart Rate Recovery?
In the long term, the same things you might do to improve your overall fitness level will also benefit your heart rate recovery, like regular exercise, proper nutrition and maintaining your body’s natural circadian rhythm.
On a daily basis, optimizing the quality and quantity of your sleep, sufficiently hydrating, practicing meditation or breathwork to relieve stress, and avoiding alcohol can all give a boost to your HRR.",8/22/20
heart-rate-recovery,Heart Rate Recovery: Why it's a Sign of Fitness & How to Improve it,"## What is Heart Rate Recovery?
Heart rate recovery (HRR) is the decrease in your heart rate as it returns to baseline following strenuous activity. Also commonly referred to as “recovery heart rate,” HRR can be a useful metric for evaluating your physical fitness.
## How to Measure Heart Rate Recovery TIME After Exercise
To calculate your HRR, check your heart rate immediately after you stop exercising. Then check it again a minute later and note the difference. Heart rate recovery is normally measured at 1, 2 or 3-minute intervals, with 1-minute HRR being the one that is most commonly used.
For example, if your heart rate is 170 beats per minute when you finish working out, and then it drops to 150 bpm a minute later, your HRR is 20 bpm.
## Why is HRR a Sign of Fitness?
As is the case with heart rate variability (HRV), heart rate recovery is a product of the interplay between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.
When you start to exercise, the sympathetic (activating or “fight or flight”) branch takes control and sends signals to your heart to beat faster in order to increase blood flow throughout your body. The opposite then occurs when exercise stops, as the parasympathetic (deactivating or “rest and digest”) branch takes over and tells your heart to beat slower.
Research shows that heart rate recovery time is a result of how fast your autonomic nervous system can “shift gears” from sympathetic activation to parasympathetic. When this happens quickly, it is an indication that your nervous system is balanced and “running on all cylinders.” It is also a sign that your body is well conditioned to adapt to its environment and perform at its best.
Additionally, studies have also found that heart rate recovery correlates with your overall cardiovascular health, and that poor HRR is associated with increased risk of cardiac events and mortality.",8/22/20
heart-rate-recovery,Heart Rate Recovery: Why it's a Sign of Fitness & How to Improve it,"Monitor HRR in Real Time Using the WHOOP Strain Target
With the WHOOP Strain Target, you can watch your live heart rate while you’re working out, and see the impact of your exercise in real time as quantified by our strain metric (a measure of cardiovascular exertion). It gives you activity level recommendations based on your daily recovery, and also tracks which heart rate zones (percentage of max heart rate) you’re training in.
Upon concluding your workout, continue to monitor your heart rate for 1 minute in order to determine your HRR (WHOOP does not automatically track it).

heart-rate-variability-hrv,Everything You Need to Know About Heart Rate Variability (HRV),"Factors that Affect Heart Rate Variability
There are a great number of things that impact your HRV. The figure below breaks them down into three categories: Training factors, lifestyle factors, and biological factors.
Training factors include the frequency and intensity of your workouts. If you go extra hard today, or for several days in a row, your HRV is likely going to take a hit. There are also many other choices you make each day (lifestyle factors) that significantly affect your heart rate variability, ranging from what you put into your body, to the quality and consistency of your sleep.
And lastly, there are biological factors that are out of your control, like age, gender and genetics–some people are just born to have higher HRV than others.
## How to Improve Heart Rate Variability
Methods for increasing HRV include the following:
Intelligent Training. Don’t overdo it and push too hard for too many days without giving your body an opportunity to recover (see below).
Hydration. The better hydrated you are, the easier it is for your blood to circulate and deliver oxygen and nutrients to your body. Aiming to drink close to one ounce of water per pound of bodyweight each day is a good goal.
Avoid Alcohol. One night of drinking potentially decreases HRV for up to five days.
Steady Healthy Diet. Poor nutrition has adverse effects on HRV, as does eating at unexpected times.
Quality Sleep. It’s not just the amount of sleep you get that matters, but also the quality and consistency of your sleep. Going to bed and waking up at similar times each day is beneficial.
Auto-Regulation. In general, trying to get your body on a consistent schedule (in particular with sleep and eating to align your circadian rhythm) is helpful. Your body does things more efficiently when it knows what’s coming.

heart-rate-variability-hrv,Everything You Need to Know About Heart Rate Variability (HRV),"## What is Heart Rate Variability (HRV)?
Heart rate variability is literally the variance in time between the beats of your heart. So, if your heart rate is 60 beats per minute, it’s not actually beating once every second. Within that minute there may be 0.9 seconds between two beats, for example, and 1.15 seconds between two others. The greater this variability is, the more “ready” your body is to execute at a high level.
Heart rate variability is determined by the time between heart beats, known as RR intervals.
These periods of time between successive heart beats are known as RR intervals (named for the heartbeat’s R-phase, the spikes you see on an EKG), measured in milliseconds. WHOOP calculates HRV using RMSSD, the root mean square of successive differences between heartbeats.
## HRV And The Autonomic Nervous System
Although HRV manifests as a function of your heart rate, it actually originates from your nervous system. Your autonomic nervous system, which controls the involuntary aspects of your physiology, has two branches, parasympathetic (deactivating) and sympathetic (activating).
The parasympathetic nervous system (often referred to as “rest and digest”) handles inputs from internal organs, like digestion or your fingernails and hair growing. It causes a decrease in heart rate.
The sympathetic nervous system (often called “fight or flight”) reflects responses to things like stress and exercise, and increases your heart rate and blood pressure.
Heart rate variability comes from these two competing branches simultaneously sending signals to your heart. If your nervous system is balanced, your heart is constantly being told to beat slower by your parasympathetic system, and beat faster by your sympathetic system. This causes a fluctuation in your heart rate: HRV.
HRV is caused by two competing branches of the autonomic nervous system, sympathetic and parasympathetic.",8/11/21

### What is a low HRV?
What is a low HRV?
A low heart rate variability (HRV) means that the time intervals between heartbeats are more consistent and less variable than usual. This can be an indication that the autonomic nervous system, which controls heart rate and other involuntary functions, is not functioning optimally. However, the definition of “low” HRV varies depending on the individual’s age, sex, and overall health.
### Should I worry if my HRV is low?
Should I worry if my HRV is low?
A low heart rate variability (HRV) may indicate a reduced ability of the body to adapt to stress. However, a single measurement of HRV is not enough to draw conclusions about a person’s health. If you are concerned about your HRV, it is best to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and interpretation.
### Is it better to have high or low HRV?
Is it better to have high or low HRV?
In general, a higher heart rate variability (HRV) is considered better as it indicates a more adaptable and resilient autonomic nervous system, which can respond effectively to different stressors. Conversely, a low HRV may be associated with an increased risk for various health problems, such as cardiovascular disease, depression, and anxiety.",8/11/21
heart-rate-variability-hrv,Everything You Need to Know About Heart Rate Variability (HRV),"Why is HRV a Sign of Fitness?
When you have high heart rate variability, it means that your body is responsive to both sets of inputs (parasympathetic and sympathetic). This is a sign that your nervous system is balanced, and that your body is very capable of adapting to its environment and performing at its best.
On the other hand, if you have low heart rate variability, one branch is dominating (usually the sympathetic) and sending stronger signals to your heart than the other. There are times when this is a good thing–like if you’re running a race you want your body to focus on allocating resources to your legs (sympathetic activity) as opposed to digesting food (parasympathetic activity).
However, if you’re not doing something active low HRV indicates your body is working hard for some other reason (maybe you’re fatigued, dehydrated, stressed, or sick and need to recover), which leaves fewer resources available to dedicate towards exercising, competing, giving a presentation at work, etc.
To look at it another way, the less one branch is dominating the other, the more room there is for the sympathetic (activating) branch to be able to come in and dominate, which is why high HRV suggests you’re fit and ready to go.

heart-rate-variability-hrv,Everything You Need to Know About Heart Rate Variability (HRV),"WHOOP: The Ultimate HRV Monitor and Training Tool
WHOOP allows you to take heart rate variability training to the next level. As mentioned previously, HRV is an extremely sensitive metric that varies greatly throughout the day. Tracking it 24/7 (or any time when you’re active) is not very useful because it fluctuates so drastically from one moment to the next. Even changes in your respiratory rate while you’re sleeping can have a significant impact on your heart rate variability.
In order to get a consistent and reliable HRV measurement, WHOOP calculates your heart rate variability using a dynamic average during sleep. It is weighted towards your last slow wave sleep stage each night, the time when you’re in your deepest period of sleep. This enables you to get an accurate understanding of your baseline from which to monitor your trends.
WHOOP is much more than an HRV tracker. Each morning, it uses your HRV (as well as your resting heart rate, respiratory rate and sleep performance) to calculate your daily recovery–how ready your body is to perform. WHOOP then quantifies the strain your body takes on, so you’ll know exactly how hard to push yourself to meet your fitness goals.

Studies have shown that heart rate variability can be a valuable tool for making the most of your training. After days of strenuous activity, your HRV will dip. With proper rest and recovery, your heart rate variability will rise, letting you know when it’s once again time to push yourself.
Intense training for several days will likely cause HRV to drop, but it will then increase when your body has time to recover.
Rather than sticking to a predetermined workout schedule, modifying the intensity and duration of your physical activity based on your heart rate variability will allow you to train smarter and more efficiently. When your HRV is high, your body is prepared to take on a greater workload. When it is low, it’s a sign to cut back.

## Health and Other Applications of HRV
Beyond using heart rate variability as a fitness metric, it also has many applications when it comes to our overall health and well being. Tracking your HRV can help you gain a better understanding of:
Nutrition
Sleep
Stress levels
Mental health
Warnings signs of sickness
Risk of disease
For example, if your daily routine is unchanged but your HRV drops, it may be an indicator of increased stress or oncoming illness. Or, if you’d like to see the effect a new diet has on your body, the impact will be noticeable in your heart rate variability.",8/11/21
heart-rate-variability-hrv,Everything You Need to Know About Heart Rate Variability (HRV),"HRV is Highly Individualized
Heart rate variability is an extremely sensitive metric. It fluctuates greatly throughout the day, from one day to the next, and from one person to another. People often wonder “What should my HRV be?” and “How does my HRV compare to others?”
Younger people tend to have higher HRV than older people, and males often have slightly higher HRV than females. Elite athletes usually have greater heart rate variability than the rest of us, and within that subset endurance athletes regularly have higher HRV than strength-based athletes. But, none of this is absolute. There are plenty of extremely fit and healthy people out there whose HRV is regularly in the 40s. What constitutes a healthy heart rate variability differs for everyone.
Better questions to ask are “What is a good heart rate variability trend for me?” and “What can I do to make that happen?”

## Heart Rate Variability Trends are What Matters
When you begin using a heart rate variability monitor, you may notice that your HRV varies greatly from day to day. This can be attributed to the many factors that affect it (more on this shortly), and is perfectly normal. If your friend has a higher HRV than you do today, that is not an indication that they are more fit than you are.
Rather than comparing your heart rate variability to others, a more practical use of HRV is to follow your own long-term trends. For example, if you’re taking steps to improve your fitness and overall health, over time you should see a gradual increase in your average heart rate variability.
A positive trend in daily heart rate variability over a 3-month time period.
Similarly, a downward trend in your HRV over several days is worth paying attention to. Among other things, it might be a sign that you’re training too hard, not sleeping enough, getting sick, eating poorly, or failing to hydrate properly.",8/11/21
heart-rate-variability-training,How to Use Heart Rate Variability (HRV) to Guide Your Training,"HRV Training Alone, or WHOOP Recovery?
It is important to understand that the WHOOP recovery algorithm is based on a lot of existing HRV and exercise research (Kiviniemi, Plews, Buchheit, Flatt, etc). From combining this groundwork into our ecosystem we’ve been able to show that things like basketball shooting percentages, exit bat velocity and fastball speed in baseball, swim times, running times, and much more all correlate to WHOOP recovery.
And while heart rate variability is an important input into recovery, research has shown that our proprietary algorithm, which also factors in resting heart rate (RHR), respiratory rate and sleep, is more predictive of next-day capacity than any of those signal markers taken in isolation.
So when designing your training, you should feel confident that WHOOP recovery is a good estimator of your capacity, especially in the context of the previous 2-3 days.
## Allostatic Load, Recovery & Overtraining Syndrome
The drive for allostatic balance is powerful, which is why if your recovery is low you will likely feel little urge to train–your body wants to use all its resources to get you back into homeostasis.
Exercising in these moments pushes all your energy away from recovery and toward meeting the energy demands of the workout. Over time, this practice can lead to “overtraining syndrome” (chronically taking on too much strain relative to capacity).
On the other hand, when WHOOP recovery is high, your body is positioned to provide the energy you need to crush your workout.",8/27/20
heart-rate-variability-training,How to Use Heart Rate Variability (HRV) to Guide Your Training,"## Homeostasis and Allostasis
The human body is constantly working to maintain its internal environment. Your brain takes feedback on the status of your body and drives behaviors to keep you in a state of balance. This process of the body striving for biological equilibrium is called “homeostasis,” and is attributable to competing inputs from the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system (ANS).
“Allostasis” is mediated by the brain and is a term used to describe how the body maintains balance by responding and adapting to external stimuli. Allostatic load is the wear and tear on the body which accumulates in individuals over time.
Heart rate variability can be used to better discern if load is functional/optimal (and contributes positively to fitness) or non-functional (and contributes negatively to fitness).
## How Heart Rate Variability Fits In
The two branches of the ANS, the parasympathetic and the sympathetic, are at the heart (pun intended, haha) of homeostasis and allostasis. HRV is a measure of the variation in time between each heartbeat and is controlled by the ANS.
High variability means your heart is responsive to both inputs from the ANS, and in this state training adaptation is likely ideal–your body is ready to perform. Low variability means your heart is less responsive to inputs from the ANS and will likely yield poorer adaption. Your level of autonomic balance (quantified by HRV) gives us insight into how your body is responding to training.
Because of this, HRV is an objective measure of the phenomena of allostasis. This knowledge can help us understand how we can better apply training load and intensity to meet our physiological intent.",8/27/20
heart-rate-variability-training,How to Use Heart Rate Variability (HRV) to Guide Your Training,"FUNCTIONAL OVERREACHING
FUNCTIONAL OVERREACHING
To accelerate fitness gains, advanced athletes will require a period of time in an “overreaching state” to achieve a new adaptation. This is literally pushing beyond the point at which your body can fully recover from training, without it breaking down. In these cases, as you increase load and intensity expect to see the following:
Mostly yellow and perhaps 1-2 green recoveries per week (with strain slightly exceeding capacity 3-4 days of the week)
HRV trends downward (around 10-15 ms)
RHR trends upward (maybe 2-3 bpm)
You shouldn’t feel a need to create major changes in your baseline metrics–red recoveries are not necessary for fitness gains.
WHOOP recovery is a powerful tool to help you monitor the delicate balance between ‘non-functional’ overreaching (which leads to overtraining) and ‘functional’ overreaching (which enables fitness gains). You will need to experiment to find your sweet spot, but generally speaking you should expect a lot of yellow recoveries during these functional overreaching phases of training.
It’s also important to monitor other lifestyle choices (sleep, diet, alcohol consumption, etc.) to accurately evaluate the impact of training on your body.
### NON-FUNCTIONAL OVERREACHING
NON-FUNCTIONAL OVERREACHING
A combination of reduced HRV and significantly elevated RHR is an indication that the body is stressed and not adapting to training stimulus in a positive fashion (it can also be a product of acute anxiety or illness). You will see decreases in performance and might lose the motivation to train.
In either case, rest is in order. You should prioritize mobility work and only partake in exercise that is enjoyable to you if you notice these signs of overtraining:
Mostly red and perhaps 1-2 yellow recoveries in a week
HRV is greatly suppressed relative to baseline (potentially a drop of 25-30 ms)
RHR is highly elevated (roughly 3-6 bpm)",8/27/20
heart-rate-variability-training,How to Use Heart Rate Variability (HRV) to Guide Your Training,"Training Spectrum
Your daily WHOOP recovery is bucketed into green, yellow, and red, which gives you objective feedback on how the stress/strain you are putting on your body might be contributing positively or negatively to cardiovascular fitness.
Recovery and HRV trends over time allow you to understand if your training is leading to an “optimal,” “overreaching” (which can be functional or non-functional, more on that below), or “restorative” state.
### OPTIMAL
OPTIMAL
In this state, individual stress response to each day of training decreases and cumulative stress load is elevated. This occurs when you are applying load and intensity and your body is adapting to that load in a positive way. You should see small incremental improvements over time:
Some distribution of higher yellow and green recoveries (which means that strain is generally not exceeding capacity)
HRV trends slightly upward
RHR trends slightly downward
To maintain this state, you should avoid training volume and intensity that create acute changes (2 or more consecutive days with greater than 20-25% deviation) to your baseline metrics.",8/27/20
heart-rate-variability-training,How to Use Heart Rate Variability (HRV) to Guide Your Training,"RESTORATIVE
RESTORATIVE
There are a lot of different ways to think about a “restorative phase,” but generally speaking it means you should take on less strain than you have the capacity for.
Early on in this taper period (after a hard functional overreaching block) your metrics will trend downward, but if you continue to keep strain low and focus on recovery they will begin to bounce back.
The goal is for your HRV and RHR numbers to end up better than they were before the functional overreaching phase. The taper period is a great way to evaluate if your training yielded physiological benefits, and you will likely see:
Yellow recoveries to start, then trending upward with ideally green recoveries toward the backend of the taper (7-10 days)
HRV is higher than pre-functional training baseline
RHR is lower",8/27/20
heart-rate-variability-training,How to Use Heart Rate Variability (HRV) to Guide Your Training,"Putting it All in Context: Other Factors Affect HRV and Recovery Too
As mentioned previously, it is important to note that training is not the sole influencer of whether or not a workout ends up meeting whatever your intent was. You can train perfectly, but still undo its benefits with other lifestyle factors (work stress, poor sleep, stressful family life, poor nutrition, etc).
It is essential to always contextualize your training, and if you are trying to illicit a very specific response you must control for the “other” hours in your day outside of training. That time will either serve to amplify your efforts or detract from them.
Continually testing and retesting both performance measures and perceived efforts is a necessary part of the process, as well as assessing them in conjunction with measures of total training loads and other lifestyle factors. This will help determine the cause and appropriate strategies to meet your intent.",8/27/20

The lighting immediately shocked the wifi so luckily they didn’t see or hear my reaction.”
“My brother and his wife were in the center of the house working in a room with no windows and they saw the blue light flash too,” he added. “They weren’t shocked, but a lot of the electronics in that room and around the house were fried.

“The unexpected nature of it is what really shook me,” Blake said. “I remember seeing a huge flash of blue light and then jumping to my feet.

New Year’s Eve topped the charts for changes in bed time, wake time, sleep consistency, and prevalence of alcohol consumption. On average, members went to bed an hour and 29 minutes later and woke up the next day around an hour and 18 minutes later than usual on NYE. This big shift in sleep timing caused an average decrease of 13.8% in sleep consistency.
Despite the later wake time on New Year’s Day, people still lost around 2.5% of sleep duration on average related to NYE. More than twice as many members reported alcohol consumption to bring in the new year when compared to baseline.

This analysis shows significant sleep changes and increases in prevalence of alcohol use as a result of almost all holidays at the population level. These behaviors may provoke similar outcomes that previous research has shown comes from acute changes in sleep and alcohol consumption. For example, research surrounding changes due to daylight saving and vacation has demonstrated increased risk in adverse health consequences (vehicle accidents, workplace injuries, heart attacks, and all-cause mortality) when people are temporarily sleep deprived, particularly when alcohol use accompanies this sleep debt.
On a more positive note, many of the holidays and eves are associated with significant increases in sleep duration that are larger than even the effect of melatonin on patients with sleep disorders, or the impact of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. So while the additional drinking may not be particularly healthy, at least our members also use the holidays as a chance to get more sleep!

We analyzed the sleep and journal data of almost 25,000 anonymous, US-based adult WHOOP members from May 1, 2020 to May 1, 2021 to determine how members’ data changed around US federal holidays compared to their “normal” WHOOP data. Specifically, we looked at bed time, wake time, sleep duration, sleep consistency, and prevalence of alcohol use of these members. This amounted to more than 10 million sleeps and over 5 million journal responses about alcohol for us to study!
The study examined over 10 million sleeps and 5 million responses on consuming alcohol.
To understand the relationship between holidays and changes in WHOOP data, we compared the population averages on each holiday and holiday eve to a baseline. We didn’t want any seasonal or weekday effects to muddy the results of our study, so our baseline consisted of the average of 8 other days–the 4 days of the same day of week preceding the holiday or eve, and the 4 days of the same day of week following the holiday or eve.
Using the baseline averages and the holiday averages, we found the average change in sleep and alcohol prevalence on each of the federal holidays and their eves.

The average change in alcohol prevalence, which we measured by percentage of “yes” responses in our journal feature out of those who responded, was just under 37% on holidays and their eves.

We often also use holidays as an opportunity to switch up our sleep patterns and maybe have an additional cocktail before bedtime since we don’t have to wake up for work in the morning.

Bed time changed by around 16 minutes on average during holidays and their eves. Most differences in bed time were later bed times, when it was on average about 22 minutes later than usual. Each of the holidays with an earlier average bedtime were Monday holidays, indicating that members were likely taking advantage of the day off to catch up on some sleep during the work week.
Wake time changed by almost 25 minutes on average. Most holidays were associated with sleeping in and on those days the average change in wake time was almost 33 minutes later. Similar to bed time, the only holidays that were associated with an earlier wake time were Monday holidays.

As the proprietor of an FDA-approved sleep aid, Lares is well-versed on the latest products in the field:
“I have my ear to the ground on all these [sleep] quantifying technologies. WHOOP blows the rest out of the water. I love the specific data points and the way you can interact with it.”
In the early-morning hours of September 23, Lares’ WHOOP Strap logged some rather unusual data:
What was going through his mind as he stepped out into the darkness?
“I knew it was a bear, but I didn’t know what kind or how many were waiting on me in there.”
As he got closer, Lares came upon a massive black bear standing over its prey, about to charge.
“From 30 feet away I saw a big black shape. At first all I could see was its eyes glowing in the beam of the flashlight, then its chest, getting ready to lunge at me. It was a pretty defining moment for a guy standing there in only his boots and boxers.”
Fortunately, Lares and his family were unharmed, although the same can not be said for all his livestock.
“It took a bit to come down off of this encounter, and I used the SR1 sleep device to get back to sleep. Although it was restless sleep, I still managed to get another hour in. Then around 8:00 a.m. I went back out to the site of the attack to assess all the damage, where my heart rate ran back up just checking the scene of the carnage.”
As can be seen in the screenshot above, Lares’ heart rate took a huge spike when he confronted the bear, and then again in the morning when he returned.
A more detailed breakdown of Lares’ data reveals the following:
WHOOP recorded a Strain of 5.9 for Lares’ meeting with the bear, which is higher than typical user’s Strain levels when playing baseball (4.8) or lacrosse (5.0), and roughly on-par with a pilates session.",11/24/16

He ventured forward with a flashlight and rifle in hand, making his way towards the pitch-black thicket where the noise was coming from.
Lares is a 51-year-old former commercial diver and bodybuilder from Columbus, OH. In 2007, he bought into a horse and hay ranch in western Canada. Four years later, Lares moved there permanently with his wife and two children. What motivated him to settle down in Nemiah Valley, British Columbia?
“Just the experience of it,” he says. “It’s absolutely beautiful country up here. Unbridled, untouched, pristine.”
Lares is a self-described “mountain man” whose athletic endeavors fall a bit outside the norm of our regular WHOOP users. He throws 4,000 square bales of hay each summer, and chops wood to heat his home in the winter, during which he must also wake up in the middle of the night on a daily basis to stoke the fireplaces throughout his house. In his own words, “it’s Rocky IV type of stuff.”
As a “one-man band” seeing to the operations of large ranch, Lares notes that he’s almost never fully recovered, and only truly realized this after using the WHOOP Strap. However, that’s not strictly the fault of the horses, chickens, pigs and cattle that he watches over–he has another full-time job as well.

If you’re having drinks, bedtime isn’t the only important factor to consider. The amount you consume matters as well. Typically, your body’s liver is able to process about one standard drink per hour – so every additional drink accumulates alcohol in the body until your system is able to metabolize it.
The WHOOP Journal allows members to input how many drinks they consumed (up to 10). WHOOP data shows that every additional drink plays a critical role in next day recovery in a fairly linear trend. On average, for every drink our members consume:
Resting Heart Rate increases an average of 1.3 bpm
Resting Heart Rate increases an average of 1.3 bpm
Resting Heart Rate increases an average of 1.3 bpm
HRV decreases an average of 2.4 ms

Alcohol is known as a diuretic, resulting in increased dehydration. How does being more hydrated change how members who drink recover? We analyzed how recovery changes for members who track both drinking and hydration, and determined that hydration may help soothe that next day recovery hangover.
Members who record both being sufficiently hydrated and consuming alcohol wake up the next morning with an average recovery of 55%, while members who consume alcohol – but report not sufficiently hydrating – see a 5% lower average recovery score at only 50%.

Timing of when you have a drink plays an important role in how recovered you may feel the following day. Alcohol has a half life in the body of between 4 and 5 hours – meaning that it takes your body that amount of time to process out half of the alcohol in the bloodstream. Given the slow processing time, the longer before bed that you stop drinking, the more time you give your body to process the alcohol and reduce any negative repercussions to sleep.
WHOOP data shows that the further from bed members reported drinking alcohol, the higher their recovery. From 9 hours before bed to 4 hours before bed, we see an average recovery drop of just 1% per hour. However, between 4 hours and 1 hour before bedtime, we see an average recovery drop of 3% per hour. The more time you give your body to process alcohol, the better your recovery will be.

Takeaways for WHOOP Users
We like to think of injuries as isolated issues and we hope to see direct correlations between actions like rehab and outcomes like decreased pain. Unfortunately, It can be tough to understand cause and effect, particularly when there are so many variables in play. Many WHOOP athletes partake in behavioral micro-experiments, particularly around Recovery modalities such as cold showers, massages, and supplements. Monitoring how they impact your metrics on the WHOOP system can be helpful to gain a better understanding of your own unique physiology.
It’s also important to look at your overall trends versus your daily stats. For example, has your HRV been consistently low for an extended period of time? Has you Deep Sleep diminished ever since you moved into a noisy apartment?
When you identify a positive or negative trend in your WHOOP data, you can then search for concrete factors that are influencing this trend, and experiment with behavior change to improve your performance results.
For Kris, we identified a specific time and place that significantly spikes his Strain to then ask questions about his physiology moving in a wheelchair. Ultimately, WHOOP enables the user to see further into your physical life and conditions like never before.

As a result of analyzing the WHOOP data, I suggested that Kris start taking cold showers to lower his body temperature after working out and to follow the advice that the WHOOP algorithm had for him on when to push and when to rest. To date, I am seeing a positive effect. It is helping him reduce his overall Strain, and in turn assisting in his Recovery.
Additionally, one of Kris’ complaints was that after he danced all day he couldn’t sleep the next night. It took him two days to return to his normal sleep level. I wondered how much of his sleep is also related to the way his body regulates temperature? I’m kind of on new ground here in terms of understanding the connection between sleep, temperature, heart rate variability, and rehabilitating his shoulder. However, I do think it is linked to Kris’s core issue of how hard his heart is working and how his temperature management, via his autonomic system, is compromised.
Results: Improved Behavior Change
“I’ve been working on my sleep, it’s getting better. Overall I’m trending in the right way,” Kris told me. However, he admits he doesn’t always follow what his WHOOP Strap suggests: “You wake up red, do very little that day. Yellow, maybe this kind of workout is OK, but avoid this kind. Green, all systems go. I wake up and I hope my Recovery is green. I listen to it as much as I can, but if I’ve got a rehearsal, or if I’ve got to do something I’m like ‘well… I’m doing it anyway.’” On those days, I tell Kris to try to at least make an effort to get more rest afterwards.",5/11/17
how-cold-showers-are-helping-kris-lenzos-shoulder-injury,How Cold Showers are Helping Kris Lenzo’s Shoulder Injury,"Dr. Brian Fuller is a Chiropractor and Kinesiologist practicing in Chicago and Oak Park, Illinois. What follows is the story of one of his more amazing patients.
Kris Lenzo asked for my help to solve a shoulder pain problem he had while dancing with a professional company here in Oak Park. He asked me if I could reduce his pain and keep him away from the surgeon–he had a chronic rotator cuff tear from eight years ago. “I’m having sleep trouble too,” he told me.
The thing is, Kris is not a typical patient. He lost both his legs when he was 19 years old–the result of goofing around with a box compactor in the factory where he worked. A bilateral leg amputation above the knees saved his life.
He’s led an astounding life since.
A former member of Team USA in both wheelchair basketball and track, Lenzo is now an accomplished dancer. In digging deeper into his current passion for dance, he told me his story of how he fell in love with movement.
“There’s a school, the Academy of Movement and Music, in Oak Park. My daughter was a preschool student there,” he said. “At my request, they built a ramp and made other renovations to make the building more wheelchair accessible. They got a grant to hire a composer to create an original piece with a dance company the school was affiliated with. They wanted a dance featuring students and family members with and without disabilities to commemorate the school becoming wheelchair accessible. I was not enthused when they asked me. But I felt obligated, and my youngest daughter, who was five at the time, wanted to do it.”
To Kris’ surprise, he ended up thoroughly enjoying it: “The experience with my daughter was great, she was so focussed and attentive. I loved how the piece came together. The composer came to all the rehearsals and played the piano and watched the dance, it was amazing to see how it evolved from nothing into a performance piece.”
Dance has been his obsession ever since.",5/11/17
how-cold-showers-are-helping-kris-lenzos-shoulder-injury,How Cold Showers are Helping Kris Lenzo’s Shoulder Injury,"Kris is a big guy, very athletic and works out three times a day, if not more. His heart rate, blood pressure and resting heart rate are all high, not what I want to see in my patients. I introduced him to the WHOOP Strap after digging deeper into what seemed to be a straightforward musculoskeletal issue. As with many patients, the pain is usually just the tip of the iceberg and the deeper we go into his history the more complex the picture becomes. I decided I needed more data to answer some important questions about his ability to regulate his autonomic nervous system. I felt that the WHOOP Strap would do just that.
Discoveries: Monitoring Patient’s Strain
As soon as Kris wore the WHOOP for two weeks I could start seeing that his Strain was extremely high in comparison to his Recovery and the amount of sleep that he got. The big thing that I wondered was why does his Strain get so high so quickly? Why does his heart rate variability take a hit from just a trip to the office and not longer workouts on the bike?
The first idea that I am exploring is that as a bilateral amputee, his circulation volume is different than yours and mine. The heart is designed to help circulate blood through your body every 16 seconds. But for him, because he has no legs, it’s maybe every 7 seconds. Thermodynamically, if he generates a little bit of heat, he can’t blow it off as fast as you or I can. His heart has to work twice as hard to pump the blood through his trunk to benefit from any cool down effect of circulation. This delayed cool down effect from less circulatory volume may result in a heart that has to work longer and harder to achieve proper temperature regulation.
I believe reducing the strain on Lenzo’s heart can also help alleviate the pain in his shoulder. In Applied Kinesiology, the heart is related to the Subscapularis muscle. This is a key shoulder stabilizer and if there is any heart stress it is safe to say shoulder stability will be compromised.",5/11/17

I also love the journal feature that WHOOP has. Seeing how all my habits and lifestyle decisions directly impact my physiology (HRV, sleep, etc) allows for a great feedback loop to make measurable changes. What is amazing about this feature is that it contains over 110 behaviors and lifestyle factors that you can log to see how they affect your data (i.e. caffeine use, hydration status, feeling stressed, post on-call shift, massage therapy, etc).
## HRV
Heart rate variability (HRV)–what is it? Simply put, it is the beat-to-beat variation of your heart rate (using medical terminology, the variability in your R-R intervals). Overall, if your HRV is low, your body is actively recovering (possibly from high-intensity training or other lifestyle decisions, including stress). Conversely, a high HRV suggests that your body is primed and ready to take on another stimulus, and you are well recovered and ready to go.
This can be applied to training (when you hit a double session or plan a rest day), or can be used to measure general trends over time (a steady increase would mean a progressive improvement in level of fitness).
WHOOP allows for very close monitoring of physiology, but at the same time it also allows you to look at the overall adaptive changes. The big picture is visualized nicely with the weekly (WPA) and monthly performance assessments (where you can see your monthly trends over a full year).",2/18/22
how-doctor-uses-recommends-whoop,A Physician on How He Uses WHOOP & Recommends It to Others,"My Experience with WHOOP
I’ve been a WHOOP member since 2017 and I absolutely love the insights it provides. When I first began using the device, I was focused on helping my local CrossFit gym – Flower City CrossFit – qualify for Regionals in 2018 (which we did). With WHOOP I hit two-a-days and yet still balance my recovery (a measure of how prepared your body is to perform each day) to my strain (the cardiovascular exertion your body takes on). This allowed me to prevent over-training and also help me focus on enhancing recovery techniques (stretching, mobility, etc) when I was “in the red.”
I was in medical school at the time, and therefore I was also trying to prioritize sleep. In fact, after the first few months of using WHOOP, I realized how poorly I was sleeping. This realization really helped me focus on improving my sleep hygiene, something that I’m still working on today.
WHOOP Enables Dr. Hajduczok to monitor strain from workouts and other daily activities.
Fortunately, having that data in real-time allows for constant adjustments and therefore minor improvements. Our daily lives are not always as structured as we like and WHOOP helps monitor on-the-fly adjustments to things like switching between working days and nights at the hospital, changing time zones due to travel, and other major changes in life (for example, moving to a new location, starting a new job, or adding a new family member to your life).
The general goal is that small sustainable adjustments allow for long-term success. Some call this the 1% rule (making yourself 1% better each day has a profound compounding impact in the long run).",2/18/22
how-doctor-uses-recommends-whoop,A Physician on How He Uses WHOOP & Recommends It to Others,"A few common questions I often get regarding WHOOP are “How do you use WHOOP?”, “Why should I get on board with WHOOP?”, or “How can WHOOP help me?” The answer, per usual, is “It depends.”
It depends on many factors regarding how I personally use WHOOP and how the individual in question may want to use WHOOP. Let me break down how I usually approach this conversation.
## How Can YOU Use WHOOP?
I usually start with some general questions:
Would you be using it for sports training, general fitness, or basic health and lifestyle? (see the decision tree below)
How are you sleeping? Do you think you could sleep more or “better”?
How is your overall time management, could this be improved?
Do you like data? Does simply having more information on things like sleep, and other physiologic metrics, appeal to you?
Regardless of your answers to these questions, one of the (many) really cool things about WHOOP is that it calibrates to you and is therefore hyper-personalized, so you can have just about any goal or use case in mind and still find value in the same metrics elite athletes and some of the world’s top performers do.

how-doctor-uses-recommends-whoop,A Physician on How He Uses WHOOP & Recommends It to Others,"Data Insights
I first realized how my training strategies changed over the years by looking back at 2+ years of HRV data and found what periods I made the most progress (then had to figure out why that was).
Interestingly, some of the busiest times during residency were the months with the highest HRV because I was laser-focused in the diet and exercise arenas. Having this feedback was crucial, as it allowed me to refocus my habits and training to optimize things moving forward.
The MPA provides you with long-term trend analysis of HRV and RHR.
I was even able to fit in marathon training last spring amongst a tight work schedule and the CrossFit Open, Quarterfinals, and Occupational Games. As the training runs became longer and longer, it was like playing Tetris with deciding which days the long runs would be best suited for–I aimed for green recovery days for running, and CrossFit on all the rest (with some key rest days).
Similarly, in the past I’ve found that even with recurrent high strain it is still possible to achieve optimal recovery. In March-April 2020, during a stretch of doing the workout ‘Murph’ every day for 30 days straight, I only had one red recovery. It is amazing how the body can adapt to rigorous training.",2/18/22
how-doctor-uses-recommends-whoop,A Physician on How He Uses WHOOP & Recommends It to Others,"Sleep
Sleep is critical to recovery. Too many of us neglect sleep and try to perform our daily tasks after spending far less time than we should in bed the night before. This may work for a short period of time, but over time will catch up to us in the form of fatigue, burnout, and even illness and injury. Not to mention the negative impact on exercise performance. WHOOP provides unparalleled sleep performance metrics.
Without the sleep data, and specifically the amount of REM/deep sleep and the sleep/wake times to aid with sleep consistency, I wouldn’t be able to balance a busy work schedule with a regular gym schedule. Sleep consistency is particularly critical because of its effects on circadian rhythm, sleep cycles, and maximizing restorative sleep (which is critical for physical and mental recovery). Visualization of time in bed is critical in instituting changes in sleep habits that have likely been in place for the last 10-20+ years.
Bed and wake times displayed in the WHOOP app give you a better understanding of sleep consistency.
The ability to look at things like time in bed versus time actually asleep, time spent in REM or deep sleep (together these are the restorative sleep stages, i.e. where recovery happens) versus light sleep, sleep disturbance, and sleep latency (how long it takes you to fall asleep) allow you to fine tune your sleep habits to optimize sleep based on your needs and limitations. Being able to look at your heart rate throughout the night is also very unique and valuable.

Lastly, as someone who has always been fascinated by the cardiovascular system (currently in cardiology training), the fact that HRV is a huge factor in the WHOOP recovery score has been a major interest of mine. It’s led to me taking a deep dive into what else the WHOOP-measured physiological metrics can be used for. The simplicity of a wrist-worn device to measure parameters such as resting heart rate, sleep, and respiratory rate in addition to HRV make WHOOP an excellent data collection tool.
We have several ongoing projects focused on improving medical training for residents, and improving patient outcomes in chronic diseases such as heart failure and inflammatory bowel disease. It is all very exciting stuff, and we hope to share results with the medical community upon conclusion of the studies.
So, whether you are a high-level athlete, general fitness enthusiast, someone who is finding their way back into the exercise realm, or a research nerd like me–having access to the data WHOOP provides and understanding how to action it can help you achieve your goals.

His lacrosse skills were good enough to earn him a scholarship to Georgetown University, where he competed at the Division 1 level for four years. After graduating in 2009, Todd moved to Manhattan and got a job in finance. He’s spent the last several years working for a variety of different software startups.
Nearly a decade after his college career came to an end, Todd still takes the field in the summertime in the Gotham Lacrosse League. He remains active in the winter, hitting the gym for an hour-and-a-half 4-6 days per week, doing everything from lifting weights to riding a stationary bike. In his own words, Todd battled a “rough string of injuries” both in and after college, including hip surgery, two ACL tears and an Achilles tear. The 30-year-old joked that these days he’s “just trying to keep things together.”
There isn’t anything about Todd’s current athletic regimen that stands out as far as noteworthy WHOOP user data goes. However, there is something else that does: He just got engaged on live national television.
Todd and his new fiancee Mallory watch The Today Show on a regular basis. When he saw the show was looking to air a proposal live on Valentine’s Day, Todd jumped at the opportunity. “I’m a big fan of the grand gesture,” he told WHOOP.
After selecting Todd’s application, the producers came to him with a few different options to surprise Mallory. Todd chose a plan which entailed Mallory taking their puppy Irving for a regular morning walk in a nearby park. Al Roker would then approach her on the street with the news that someone had an important question to ask her.",2/15/17

The story they gave her was that Todd had submitted Irving to a “love your pet on Valentine’s Day competition,” with the puppy getting chosen to be on the show.
Todd was wearing his WHOOP Strap the entire time, and he was kind enough to let us share his data. Despite a subpar sleep performance the night before (can you blame him?), he was very well recovered for his big day:
Below is a graph of Todd’s heart rate data from 7:30 to 8:30 that morning:
He arrived at the NBC studios at 7:35 am with a heart rate of 70 beats per minute. It rose steadily as he was prepped for the show, reaching 130 when he was brought out to the set at 7:57. At that point, Todd stood and waited for a few minutes with just his family around him–clearly they were a calming and soothing influence. His heart rate then began climbing rapidly as Roker led Mallory outside, peaking at 132 when the moment happened (circled).
And don’t worry, she said “Yes.”

## What is WHOOP Recovery?
WHOOP recovery is a daily measure of how prepared your body is to perform, no matter what it is that you do. It quantifies how your body is adapting to various stressors–for everything from training for elite athletic competition, to even just working from home in your sweats.
After you get up each morning WHOOP calculates your recovery as a percentage, and categorizes it as green, yellow, or red.
### WHOOP RECOVERY IS A PERCENTAGE COLOR-CODED AS GREEN, YELLOW OR RED.
WHOOP RECOVERY IS A PERCENTAGE COLOR-CODED AS GREEN, YELLOW OR RED.
GREEN (67-99%): You are well recovered and primed to perform. Whether it’s at home, at work, or in the gym, your body is signaling that it can handle a strenuous day.
YELLOW (34-66%): Your body is maintaining and ready to take on moderate amounts of strain.
RED (1-33%): Rest is likely what your body needs. It is working hard to recover, potentially from overtraining, sickness, stress, lack of sleep, or other lifestyle factors.
The average recovery for WHOOP members is approximately 58%.",3/30/22
how-does-whoop-recovery-work-101,How Does WHOOP Recovery Work?,"How Does WHOOP Calculate Recovery?
WHOOP incorporates several key physiological metrics into your daily recovery:
Heart Rate Variability (HRV): Literally the variance in time between your heart beats, HRV is a benchmark of your autonomic nervous system that is very useful for evaluating physical fitness. To learn more, check out our Ultimate Guide to HRV.
Resting Heart Rate (RHR): Another valuable fitness indicator, a lower RHR is a sign that your heart doesn’t need to work as hard to pump blood throughout your body.
Sleep Performance: The amount of sleep you get compared to the amount of sleep you need. Your body and mind restore and repair themselves during sleep, so it is an essential part of recovery.
Respiratory Rate: The number of breaths you take per minute, your respiratory rate generally stays fairly consistent from night to night and often doesn’t impact your recovery. However, significant changes to it are likely meaningful and possibly a sign of sickness.
HRV, Resting heart rate, Sleep & Respiratory Rate ARE ALL Factored into your daily recovery.
If you have a WHOOP 4.0, blood oxygen level and skin temperature are included in your recovery as well and can help provide a better understanding of when you may be ill.
## Recovery & Strain
How recovered you are each morning determines your capability to take on strain that day–the better your recovery, the more strain your body is prepared for.
Your Recovery dictates how much strain your body is ready to handle.
Based on your recovery, WHOOP recommends an optimal strain each day. It’s a suggested amount intended to allow you to maintain fitness while still enabling your body to adequately recover (go above and you are “overreaching,” stay below and you are “restoring”).

how-does-whoop-strain-work-101,How Does WHOOP Strain Work?,"Activity Strain vs. Day Strain
When WHOOP notices a spike in heart rate and movement for a sustained period of time, it will automatically detect your activity or workout and give you a strain value for it (you can also add other activities manually and see their strain).
Your total day strain provides you with additional insight into the cardiovascular load your body takes on outside of exercise. For example, a presentation at work or a busy afternoon with the kids might raise your day strain above average, even on a day you don’t work out.
WHOOP detects your workouts and tells you how strenuous they are. YOUR Day strain is not the sum of your activities.
If you have multiple workouts in a day, the strain of your activities does not add up to your total day strain. The WHOOP strain algorithm is logarithmic, meaning the higher your strain gets the harder it becomes to build more.
As illustrated by the top graphic above, it is much easier to go from a 0 to 10 strain than it is to go from a 10 to 20. Hypothetically, running a marathon might lift your day strain to 20.4 or 20.5, but then running a second one that day could only increase it to 20.6 or 20.7.

The higher your recovery is, the more strain your body is ready to take on.
The amount of strain your body is ready to handle is dictated by your recovery each day.
You may notice strain accumulate faster on days when you have a low recovery, because your body is not as prepared to handle it. A workout routine that usually gives you a 9.5 might be a 10.5 when you’re in the red.
The Strain Target suggests an optimal amount for you to take on each day based on your recovery. It’s a recommended level of strain intended to let you maintain fitness and still adequately recover the following day.
Your Weekly Performance Assessments show the balance between your Strain and Recovery.
If you go above this amount you are “overreaching” (good for making fitness gains, but likely detrimental to your next-day recovery), and if you stay below it you are “restoring.”
In turn, the amount of strain you take on today then affects what your recovery will be tomorrow.

## What is WHOOP Strain?
WHOOP strain is a measure of cardiovascular and muscular exertion that quantifies the amount of physical and mental stress you’re putting on your body. We track your strain on a 0-21 scale, both for your entire day and for specific workouts and activities.
Inspired by Borg’s Rating of Perceived Exertion, strain numbers can be loosely broken down as follows:
WHOOP measures your strain on a 0-21 scale. the higher it gets the harder it is to build more.
LIGHT (0-9): Minimal stress put on the body, room for active recovery
MODERATE (10-13): Moderate stress on the body, generally good for maintaining fitness
HIGH (14-17): Increased stress and activity level, ideal for making fitness gains when training
ALL OUT (18-21): Significant stress, often overreaching, likely very difficult to recover from the next day
Why WHOOP Doesn’t Count Steps",5/17/22
how-does-whoop-strain-work-101,How Does WHOOP Strain Work?,"What Causes Strain & How Does WHOOP Calculate It?
WHOOP measures strain based on cardiovascular load and muscular load. Cardiovascular being your heart rate, and the higher your HR gets and the longer it stays elevated, the more strain you accumulate. When you use Strength Trainer, WHOOP can track your weights, reps, and sets to understand the demands you are putting on your musculoskeletal system.
Muscular load measures movement and its underlying physics using the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors in WHOOP, and combines these signals with advanced biomechanics and mathematics. This metric includes both volume and intensity components.
Volume is measured similarly to traditional volume load, but it incorporates effective mass. It takes into account your body mass, but only includes the parts of your body that are moving and doing the work. For example, a full body exercise like a squat or clean and jerk will have more muscular load than a bench press.
Intensity quantifies how much effort or exertion you are giving to complete the lift. This includes the speed of the movement and the proximity to failure, or the fatigue profile of the set.
WHOOP then calculates the cardiovascular and muscular load of your strength training to give you one complete Strain score.
Regular daily activities like work, commuting, running errands, and parenting may all cause strain. So can stress, anxiety, excitement, or feeling nervous–even being a sports fan is strenuous.

Average Strain of 10 Most Popular Activities
## Strain is Highly Individualized
Strain is calculated from your personal HR metrics and accounts for your individual fitness level. Since it quantifies how hard your body works and not what your body does, two people who complete the same activity may have very different strains.
For example, a 90-minute hike that registers a 10 or 11 strain for the average person might be just a 5 or 6 for a highly conditioned athlete. Along the same lines, as your fitness improves you’ll start to see lower strains for that same activity.

how-hard-to-push-during-workout,How Hard Should You Push Yourself When Exercising?,"For most of my life, I went all-in during every workout. If I wasn’t on the floor in pain, trying to suppress the urge to vomit, I felt like I hadn’t pushed myself hard enough.
In this post, I’ll share some of the lessons I’ve learned since retiring from my career as a professional athlete. I’ll also explain how tools like WHOOP have helped me change my attitude towards performance and recovery, and better answer the question “How hard should you work out?”
At the end, I’ll share my Top 8 tips for getting fitter and healthier while reducing your risk of injury—regardless of how fit you are today.
## Work Harder Than The Competition
I’ve always been a person who is motivated to do my best at everything I do. For sports, and my former career as a professional track and field athlete, that meant pushing myself harder than my competitors. My goal was to give 100% maximum effort 100% of the time.
I figured that if I didn’t “redline” at every workout, someone else would—and they’d get a step ahead of me because of it.
In my early 20s, I was a 100-meter sprinter representing Austria in international competition. I remember times when I felt proud and accomplished after workouts, despite laying on the track next to the contents of my stomach. The puke was proof that I had worked harder than anyone else—or at least as hard as my body could handle. It was literally a fierce battle between my mind and my body (one that my mind usually won).
After I ended my sports career, I moved to the United States. That was back in 2007, and at that time I was only exercising sporadically, lifting weights with friends or running a few times a week.
But even then, I couldn’t help but push myself and max out my effort. After running, I would lie in my driveway, drenched in sweat and gasping for air. One day, a neighbor saw me and ran over to ask if I needed medical attention. I guess I must have looked especially exhausted that day.",9/5/19
how-hard-to-push-during-workout,How Hard Should You Push Yourself When Exercising?,"Final Words
As of this writing, I’m 37 years old. According to WebMD, our fitness levels start naturally declining after our 20s. As a result, you might think that I was much fitter in my 20s—as a professional athlete—than I am now.
Interestingly enough, my metabolic conditioning is far superior now. And just a few weeks ago, I achieved a new 1 rep max clean.
Today I’m stronger than ever. I have more endurance, I feel and sleep better, and I have better body composition.
What that tells me is that I wasn’t tapping into my full potential when I was in my 20s. Instead, I overtrained, fed my body the wrong food, and thought getting a solid seven or eight hours of sleep was a luxury I couldn’t afford.
The good news is that it’s never too late to change those patterns. Learn how to not kill yourself at every workout and you’ll see positive results sooner than you’d expect.",9/5/19
how-hard-to-push-during-workout,How Hard Should You Push Yourself When Exercising?,"CrossFit Rekindled My Passion For “Pushing It”
In 2017, inspired by a friend and our neighbors who coach at CrossFit Alpharetta (near Atlanta), I signed up for CrossFit. Even though I had no aspiration to become a professional athlete again, CrossFit rekindled my passion for fitness—and for pushing my aging body to its limits.
My wife used to make fun of the fact that I was the only one lying on the floor for 10 minutes after every workout. Everyone else was cleaning up their equipment and getting ready to head home, but I didn’t care. I was still convinced that I would only improve by pushing myself to the limit every time I hit the gym.
## Why Does Everyone Get Hurt at CrossFit?
It’s now 2019, and my performance has improved dramatically since I started CrossFit two years ago. But that improvement has not come without numerous aches and injuries.
I wasn’t surprised by those setbacks. Everyone warned me that I would get hurt doing CrossFit. That’s just how it goes, they said.
But why?
After one-and-a-half years of doing CrossFit, I got to a point where I could only work out three or four times a week, instead of the five or six times that was my norm when I first started out. My body started hurting so much that I needed more time to recover.",9/5/19
how-hard-to-push-during-workout,How Hard Should You Push Yourself When Exercising?,"How WHOOP Has Visualized My Recovery
A few weeks after I changed my approach to CrossFit, a fellow athlete introduced me to a fitness tracker called WHOOP and suggested that I review it on my blog.
I reached out to WHOOP and they graciously sent me a review unit to test. Frankly, I didn’t expect much. But I wanted to find out how WHOOP compared to the Apple Watch, which is what I had been using to track my workouts.
However, when I learned about the treasure trove of data that WHOOP provides—combined with actionable analytics—I got hooked. I’ve been wearing both the Apple Watch and WHOOP ever since, and strongly recommend the latter to my friends and fellow athletes.
What I really like about WHOOP is how it uses my biometric data to provide insight into how recovered I am and how much strain my body can handle on a given day.
By wearing WHOOP 24/7, the band keeps constant tabs on my resting heart rate, strain, quality of sleep and heart rate variability (an important indicator of how my nervous system is doing).
In other words, WHOOP can tell me how my sleep and daily stress—in addition to the physical stress from working out—affects my recovery and my ability to take on additional strain.
## How My Workout Attitude Has Changed
I still have a very competitive mindset. But I’ve realized that redlining at every workout is unsustainable and ineffective.
Letting my body win out over my mind is still a daily challenge. Over the years I built a habit of kicking my own butt, and it’s difficult to un-learn that proclivity. But I’ve seen how much better I feel—and how much quicker I progress—by letting go of the desire to be first every time.
WHOOP has helped me evolve from a brute-force competitor to a sophisticated athlete, and my fitness is better because of that.",9/5/19

6. Practice Mindfulness
When I first discovered the “Breathe” app I figured it was a useless gimmick. I tried it once or twice, but didn’t see the purpose of it.
Now that I’ve realized the benefits of mindfulness and breathing, I use it several times a day. It helps me relax, reduce tension, and momentarily disconnect from everything that’s going on around me.
### 7. Treat Recovery as Important as You Treat Strain
7. Treat Recovery as Important as You Treat Strain
For many athletes, recovery is often seen as a luxury they can’t afford (or don’t have time for).
I have a daily reminder to stretch. But guess what? More often than not, I don’t get around to it because “I don’t have time.”
However, stretching is only one of the methods I use for recovery. Others include:
Breathing
Active recovery—completing a workout at lower intensity than usual
Getting a good night’s sleep
As you can see, recovery doesn’t necessarily require additional time, you can simply weave it into your daily routine.
### 8. Remember Your Goals
8. Remember Your Goals
Don’t forget why you started working out in the first place. If improving your overall health is your primary goal—as opposed to competing at the CrossFit Games—”redlining” at every workout might feed your ego, but it won’t make you any healthier.
It’s all too easy to get wrapped up in the competition… even if it’s only for the top spot on the local leaderboard. I’ve found myself in that situation several times over the past two years, but then I remembered why I started CrossFit in the first place—to complement my healthy lifestyle, reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases, and improve my functional fitness.
To achieve those goals, it doesn’t matter where I end up on the leaderboard.
Plus, being aware of your fitness goals doesn’t mean that you can’t also be competitive. I still push myself when the time is right, I just no longer feel like I’m missing out—or letting myself down—when I don’t.",9/5/19

3. Maintain a Healthy Diet
Food is fuel for your body. If you maintain an unhealthy diet, don’t expect great performance. You should also realize that you can’t out-exercise a bad diet.
When I was a young athlete, I figured I could eat whatever I wanted—as long as I worked out 13 times a week. Unfortunately, that was, and is, a misconception.
Learn as much as you can about food and its impact on your well-being. That way, you can use it as a tool to maximize your health and performance.

4. Listen to What Your Body is Trying to Tell You
WHOOP collects and visualizes actionable data that can help you better understand your body and tweak your training schedule and workout plan.
Every morning, I open the WHOOP app and check my heart rate variability (HRV), recovery score, and sleep analysis. I approach my workouts based on that data (as well as feedback from my body), and use that information to pursue my fitness goals more efficiently.
### 5. Learn to Appreciate Lower-Intensity Workouts
5. Learn to Appreciate Lower-Intensity Workouts
I’ve learned that by not getting caught up in competing for the No. 1 spot on the leaderboard, I actually have time and energy to focus on the quality of my movements.
Additionally, I’ve noticed that I’m suddenly more aware of what’s going on around me during a workout. It’s like running through the forest and hearing the bees hum and the birds chirp, as opposed to being so focused on your run that you hardly notice you’re in a forest.
In the past I had tunnel vision, so that realization has been incredibly satisfying and it has reduced the psychological stress of workouts tremendously.",9/5/19
how-hard-to-push-during-workout,How Hard Should You Push Yourself When Exercising?,"The Importance of Learning to Hold Back
Around that time, the owner of our box introduced us to a concept called heart rate training. The idea behind that is to keep tabs on your heart rate, and to perform several workouts a week at low to medium intensity (while keeping your heart rate under a certain threshold).
The goal of heart rate training is to improve your cardio capacity by increasing the threshold at which the body switches from fat to glycogen as its primary source of energy during a workout.
Many athletes in our box were skeptical about that concept because they didn’t see the sense in working out at such low intensity.
I took heart rate training as an opportunity to free myself from the need to compete—against myself and others. Instead, I could simply perform the exercises with little mental or physical stress.
In other words, I learned to be OK with not claiming the top spot on the leaderboard at the end of the day.
As a result, I could work out more often without feeling overtrained and beaten up.",9/5/19

### 1. Acknowledge External Stress
1. Acknowledge External Stress
Daily stress can be more detrimental to your performance on a given day than physical strain from a previous workout. It’s important to acknowledge that, and to adapt your training and workout plan accordingly.
If you show up at the gym all stressed out, don’t expect great results. Instead, take a few minutes to disconnect; consider leveraging breathing exercises, and scale your workout (if necessary). That might mean slightly less-intense strength training or performing a metcon WOD at less intensity.
### 2. Be Protective of Your Sleep
2. Be Protective of Your Sleep
Sleep is arguably the most important of the three pillars that make up a healthy lifestyle—diet and exercise being the other two. So it’s important to protect your sleep at all costs, because it’s crucial for your recovery, performance and overall well-being.

Using the data, you can monitor your sleeping patterns and learn more about how you sleep. The WHOOP Sleep Planner uses your circadian rhythm, previous sleeps, naps, and daily strain to make recommendations on bed and wake times to help you maximize your sleep.

Having your sleep interrupted by things out of your control is more than frustrating. It can also affect your mood, metabolism and immune system.
## What is a Light Sleeper?
Being a light sleeper is different from light sleep. Light sleep is one of four stages of sleep: The others being wake, slow wave sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. We enter the light sleep stage first as part of a sleep cycle. Light sleepers wake up in response to small disturbances, like noise from wind in the trees or a partner rolling over in bed next to you. They also tend to spend more time in light sleep than heavy sleepers. This is why getting a good night’s sleep can be more difficult for light sleepers. Symptoms of being a light sleeper include:
Feeling tired throughout the day
Wanting or taking a nap during the day
Having trouble falling asleep at night
Waking up frequently throughout the night
WHOOP monitors your sleep and shows you how long you spend in each sleep stage. It can help you spot anomalies such as unusual wakings.",10/29/21
how-light-sleepers-can-get-more-sleep,How Light Sleepers Can Get More Sleep,"Why are Some People Light Sleepers?
Researchers haven’t found a single reason why some people have more difficulty staying asleep than others, but some light sleepers may have a low “arousal threshold,” the minimal intensity at which a stimulus triggers an arousal during sleep.
Your arousal threshold is affected by several factors including the state of sleep you’re in, how long you were awake, anxiety, and age. Older adults are more prone to waking during the night and they sleep less overall.
Other causes may be undiagnosed sleep disorders, genetics, or lifestyle choices like drinking caffeinated beverages late in the day. Sleep disorders could include insomnia, snoring (a partner may be able to diagnose this), and sleep apnea. Poor sleep is related to long-term health issues such as high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.
## How Sleep Spindles Affect Sleep
Sleep researchers have identified brain-wave spikes called “sleep spindles.” These spindles are bursts of brain waves during non-REM sleep and appear to protect sleepers from waking up in response to noise. Research has shown that sleepers with more sleep spindles tend to sleep more soundly and deeply, while sleepers with fewer sleep spindles tend to wake more easily. This may help explain why older people are light sleepers, since they produce fewer sleep spindles.",10/29/21
how-light-sleepers-can-get-more-sleep,How Light Sleepers Can Get More Sleep,"9 Sleep Tips for Light Sleepers
There are several things light sleepers can do to improve their sleep, including:
Get some sunlight. Sunlight plays a central role in regulating your circadian rhythm. Exposure to sunlight early in the day can reinforce your circadian rhythm.
Train yourself to sleep. Create a bedtime routine and work on your sleep hygiene. Set and follow a sleep schedule every day, even days off.
Don’t nap during the day. Naps can be refreshing, but they can also be problematic. You nap because you’re tired but then you can’t sleep at night. Skip napping when you’re training yourself to sleep at night.
Avoid caffeine. Don’t drink coffee or caffeinated beverages in the afternoon. You may also want to avoid chocolate, tea, and any medications and other products that have caffeine. Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors in the brain. Adenosine is a sleep-promoting chemical your brain produces during waking hours. The more it builds up, the sleepier you are. When caffeine interferes with this process, you remain alert.
Steer clear of alcohol. Alcohol inhibits your quality of sleep and can prevent you from entering the restorative stages of sleep.
Turn off the electronics. Avoid blue light for 30-60 minutes before bedtime. Blue light directly affects your circadian rhythm. If you do watch TV or play with your phone, try wearing blue-light blocking glasses.
Keep your bedroom dark, cool and quiet. Take out the TV and charge your phone in another room. Set the thermostat between 60-67 degrees Fahrenheit. When you get into bed, you’ll have a cozy blanket to snuggle under in a cool, quiet room.
Block noise. When nightly noise is bothersome, consider using a white noise machine or leaving a fan on. The hum can help mask other noises.
Wear an eye mask. If your partner’s midnight bathroom trip wakes you up, consider wearing an eye mask. Light exposure at night can impede transitions between sleep cycles and reduce the quality of sleep.",10/29/21

how-long-does-alcohol-stay-in-system,How Long Does Alcohol Stay in Your System and What Does it Do to It?,"Athletic Performance, Recovery & Lingering Impact of Alcohol
At the most basic level, your body is less capable of taking on strain when it’s poorly recovered. Most athletes fully understand they won’t perform at their best after a night of drinking, but alcohol can impact workouts from before you drink too. How is this possible?
You don’t actually get stronger or fitter while you’re exercising. Working out breaks down your muscles slightly, then they rebuild and repair themselves during deep sleep (when the body produces 95% of its human growth hormone). Since blood alcohol concentrations in your system inhibit deep sleep, they also prevent you from making fitness gains from your workouts that day.
Additionally, one night of alcohol consumption can have much longer-lasting effects that you might expect. In a study of collegiate athletes, we found that 74% had suppressed recovery metrics the day after reporting drinking (again with no amount specified). Surprisingly, 29% were still below baseline 2 days after consuming alcohol, and 19% after 3 days. Some even continued to be affected for 4 and 5 days.
Alcohol can impact resting heart rate and HRV for up to 4-5 days.

## How Long Does it Take to Metabolize ONE Drink?
For the most part, it takes roughly an hour for your body to metabolize 1 drink. However, this can change due to a number of factors, in particular the size and strength of the drink. Traditionally, a 12-ounce beer, a 5-ounce glass of wine, and a 1.5-ounce shot all contain about the same amount of alcohol. But if you consume drinks that are larger or have a greater alcohol percentage, it will take your body more time to metabolize them.
Women’s bodies also usually take a bit longer to metabolize a drink than men’s do.",12/6/21
how-long-does-alcohol-stay-in-system,How Long Does Alcohol Stay in Your System and What Does it Do to It?,"Does Alcohol Increase Heart Rate? (and its Effect on HRV & Sleep)
Many people falsely believe that since alcohol is a sedative it can help them sleep. Unfortunately, they don’t realize that although it might technically put them to sleep faster, it drastically reduces the overall quality of their sleep.
When your body is sedated and simultaneously working hard to scrub alcohol from your system, it is unable to reach the restorative stages of sleep (REM and deep sleep). Even if you sleep for a long time following alcohol consumption, you’ll likely just get a lot of light sleep and not wake up feeling refreshed or well rested.
Here is an example of one WHOOP member’s sleeping heart rate on successive Saturday nights. The first represents a normal night’s sleep, while the second is after they had 4 drinks in the evening prior to bedtime:
What heart rate Data looks like during a typical night’s sleep compared to after consuming alcohol.
You can see the dramatic difference in heart rate, with the first being significantly lower (average of 51 beats per minute compared to 64) and much more consistent. In the second example, the heart rate during the early portion of sleep is much higher as the body processes alcohol in the blood (a major stressor). Even once it begins to drop, the HR still continues to spike frequently.
Also notice that the first example includes more time asleep despite spending less time in bed–greater sleep efficiency thanks to fewer disturbances brought on by alcohol in the body.
Along with bad sleep and elevated heart rate, alcohol is extremely detrimental to your heart rate variability as well. In an analysis of WHOOP Journal data, when our members reported drinking alcohol before going to sleep (anywhere from just 1 drink to several) we found HRV decreased by an average of 7 milliseconds compared to baseline.

how-long-does-alcohol-stay-in-system,How Long Does Alcohol Stay in Your System and What Does it Do to It?,"On average, alcohol can be found in your bloodstream for roughly 6-12 hours after consumption (depending on the amount) and detected via breathalyzers or urine tests for about 24 hours. While your body usually breaks it all down within a day, we’ve found the effects of alcohol may actually linger for much longer.
Below we’ll look at how your body metabolizes alcohol, as well as factors that influence the speed at which it’s able to do so. We’ll also examine the impact drinking alcohol has on heart rate, HRV, sleep, and other physiological data tracked by WHOOP, plus how long these metrics can be negatively affected by it.
## How Does the Body Metabolize Alcohol?
The first place alcohol goes when you drink it is into your stomach. It then enters your blood through the lining of your stomach and small intestine. Enzymes in the stomach can begin to break it down prior to hitting your bloodstream, but this varies from one person to the next. Food in your stomach may also help to absorb the alcohol and block it from moving on to the small intestine.
Most of the alcohol gets to your bloodstream through the duodenum (the beginning of your small intestine), where it is then carried to your brain and all other organs in your body. After that, the liver works to process alcohol in your blood. Although your liver is the primary organ responsible for metabolizing alcohol, small amounts of it also exit your body through your kidneys (urine), lungs (breath), and skin (sweat).",12/6/21
how-long-should-you-nap,"Naps: Ideal Length, Benefits and Reducing Sleep Need","How Long Should a Nap Be for Me?
Are you wondering “How long should I nap to wake up refreshed?” The answer is most likely around 90 minutes, but given how hard that can be to fit into our busy lives, opting for a 10-20 minute power nap is an appealing alternative.
The time of day you plan to nap is also important to consider. For example, taking a long nap in the evening close to bed time will almost certainly make it difficult for you to fall asleep later on. The best time to take a nap is usually in the mid afternoon (your body temperature drops around then and it also produces more melatonin) prior to about 3 pm, depending on what your normal schedule is. Ideally you should nap as close as possible to the mid point between your usual wake and bed times.
Unfortunately for many of us, getting in even a 10-minute afternoon nap is often impossible during the typical work day. If you can’t nap, try going outside for a bit and letting the sunlight hit your body instead. This will inhibit production of melatonin and help you feel energized.
## Can You Catch Up on Sleep by Napping?
Yes! Meeting your nightly sleep need is often a difficult task. A nap during the day (regardless of how long it is) helps reduce the amount of sleep your body requires at night.
Based on previous sleep and strain you have accumulated, WHOOP calculates exactly how much sleep you should get each night in order to optimize your recovery the next morning. When you take a nap, the WHOOP Sleep Planner incorporates it into the equation and adjusts accordingly the time it recommends you spend in bed that night.

In this case, you may actually end up feeling more tired and less alert than before you went to sleep. Following light sleep your body enters deep sleep (also known as slow wave sleep, when your brain waves slow down), and being woken during this stage leads to sleep inertia, a state of sluggishness and disorientation. The effects of sleep inertia are even worse when you are sleep deprived, which is likely the reason you’re taking a nap in the first place.
However, you will not see any of the cognitive benefits of sleeping from a short nap that only includes light sleep. In order for that to happen, you need to get at least a few minutes of deep sleep. Additionally, research has shown that naps which include deep sleep but not REM sleep will improve declarative memory tasks (mental things like remembering something and repeating it back), but will not improve procedural memory tasks (physical things like performing a specific activity). Typically you have to be asleep for about 90 minutes in order to reach REM sleep.
## Why Is a 90-Minute Nap Good?
For most people, 90 minutes is the length of a full sleep cycle, which allows you to spend time in each stage of sleep (light, deep and REM, in that order). If you’re sleep deprived (meaning you failed to get all the sleep your body needed the night before), napping for 90 minutes and cycling through every stage of sleep is the best way to feel rested and rejuvenated afterwards.
## Is a 2-Hour Nap Too Long?
Not necessarily, depending on how sleep deprived you are or how much your body may need to recover from physical activity. But, if you nap for much longer than this there’s a good chance it’s going to disturb your circadian rhythm. What you do not want to happen is to have trouble falling asleep at night because you napped for too long during the day.

Naps enhance performance, both mental and physical. For athletes, things like reaction time improve, and in the corporate world your cognitive abilities are heightened. Additional nap benefits include:
• Better mood
• Increased alertness
• Greater ability to learn
• Relaxation
• Reduce fatigue
• Lower nightly sleep need
• Help prevent high blood pressure
## Power Nap Length
Most of us trend towards quick power naps, simply because they are easier to fit into our daily routine. How long should a power nap be? A 2006 study published by the Sleep Research Society found that 10-minute naps improved the participants’ subjective sleepiness and cognitive performance, and were the “most effective afternoon nap duration” of the lengths they examined. Naps that were 20 minutes long produced similar results as well.
The National Sleep Foundation also states that “most people feel refreshed after a nap that lasts approximately 20 minutes.” Why is a 20-minute nap good for you? When you first fall asleep, your body goes through a stage of light sleep. Naps that are 20 minutes or less tend to keep you in this stage, which makes it much easier to wake up without feeling groggy.
On the other hand, napping for less than 10 minutes is usually not enough to see any of the benefits of sleep, so the best power nap time is considered to be 10-20 minutes. If you only have a few minutes available to rest, you’re probably better off practicing mindfulness or meditation instead of trying to nap.",1/14/20

There are a number of reasons you may be losing sleep at night, such as napping or drinking coffee or tea too late in the day. Sleep disorders like sleep apnea can disrupt your deep sleep leaving you with symptoms of sleep deprivation. Symptoms of deep sleep deprivation can include:
Worsening chronic pain: People who suffer from chronic pain may experience worsening symptoms when they do not get enough deep sleep. This can become a cycle in which chronic pain leads to poor sleep leading to worsening pain.
Feeling exhausted: When you wake up not just tired but feeling a lingering fatigue that is consistent and limits your ability or desire to do anything, it may be due to a lack of deep sleep.
Difficulty remembering: Your brain processes and consolidates new information during SWS and missing deep sleep can negatively affect your memory. Lost deep sleep can also mean you’re less alert and focused the next day and less able to learn things.
Brain fog: If you’ve gotten your 90 minutes of deep sleep at night you should wake feeling alert and refreshed. Not getting enough SWS can lead to poor concentration, an inability to focus, decreased mental clarity, and put you in a haze that prevents you from staying focused when you need to be.
Other symptoms include:
Lowered immune response
Increased anxiety
Escalated stress hormone production
Reduced sex drive
Curtailed energy expenditure and raised drive to eat–leading to weight gain
Reduced athletic performance

how-much-deep-sleep-do-you-need,How Much Deep Sleep Do You Need?,"Tips for Getting More Deep Sleep
The easiest way to get more SWS at night is to avoid napping during the day. It’s natural to feel tired in the midafternoon, but don’t stretch out for a catnap. Being awake for extended periods can enhance your “homeostatic sleep drive,” which means that the longer you stay awake the more you want to sleep. When you finally go to bed, you’ll likely increase your deep sleep.
Maintaining sleep consistency, or going to bed and waking up at the same time every day can help support deep sleep.
Many people think that a drink in the evening helps them sleep better, but alcohol has a significant negative effect on the quality of sleep you’re getting. Your body cannot reach restorative deep sleep while it’s trying to process alcohol. You’ll end up getting more light sleep and less of the restful deep sleep you need, and you will not feel refreshed upon waking. If you’re trying to get more slow wave sleep, avoid the evening beer or cocktail.

how-much-deep-sleep-do-you-need,How Much Deep Sleep Do You Need?,"Deep sleep, also called slow wave sleep (SWS) is one of the four sleep stages we experience each night, along with wake, light sleep, and REM sleep. Deep sleep is the stage where your body heals itself, regenerates cells and tissue, and strengthens your immune system.
It’s called deep sleep because it’s the most restful stage of sleep and the most difficult to wake directly from. Sleep experts call it slow wave sleep because the brain waves slow down significantly. Your heart rate and respiratory rate also decrease during deep sleep as your body recovers for the next day.
Adults generally average 1-2 hours of deep sleep per night, somewhere between 15 and 25% of your nightly sleep. Most of our deep sleep comes in the first sleep cycle of the night, usually 45-90 minutes. Age has a major effect on how much deep sleep we get each night and how much we need.
Aproximately 15 to 25% of adults’ nightly sleep is deep sleep.
## Deep Sleep Decreases as We Age
Children generally get more deep sleep than adults and experience most of their growth during this stage. Teenagers also need more slow wave sleep than adults for the same reason. As we age, the time we spend in deep sleep decreases at a rate of about 1.7% per decade.
There may be several reasons for these declines such as the aches and pains that come with aging and a greater likelihood of daytime napping. For the most part, men experience steeper declines of deep sleep. Men aged 70 and older spend an average of 5% of their time asleep in deep sleep, while women in the same age bracket spend between 15% and 20% of theirs in deep sleep. This may be because older women tend to go to bed earlier than older men.

how-much-rem-sleep-do-you-need,Can You Get Too Much REM Sleep? Are You Getting Enough?,"Rapid eye movement sleep, more commonly referred to as REM sleep, is one of 4 stages of sleep (also light, slow wave/deep, and wake) that your body spends time in each night. REM is the “mentally restorative” sleep stage during which your brain converts short-term memories made during the day into long-term ones.
Getting enough REM sleep is an essential part of keeping your brain and body healthy and optimizing daily performance. So, how much REM sleep do we need? On average, for most adults it’s about 90 minutes per night. However, this can change for a variety of different reasons that we’ll dive into below.
## What Does Typical REM Sleep Look Like?
While we’re asleep the human body goes through several sleep cycles (normally 3-5 per night). Within each cycle, the REM stage usually comes last, following light and deep sleep. Your first period of REM sleep is generally only a few minutes long. REM cycles then get longer as the night progresses, with the final one often lasting up to an hour.
For healthy adults, 20-25% of your total time asleep should be REM sleep. That’s where the 90-minute number mentioned above comes from. If you sleep for 7-8 hours, 20% of that equates to roughly an hour-and-a-half, or 90 minutes.
However, it’s worth noting that the amount of REM sleep we need also declines with age. With newborn babies, it can be 50% of their total sleep time. Sleep studies indicate that percentage drops significantly early on, then continues to decrease gradually as we get older.

Getting an unusually large amount of REM sleep in a given night is often an indication that you are sleep deprived. Your body routinely gets most of its REM sleep later in the night, during the final hours that you are asleep. If you wake up very early or don’t sleep as long as you normally do, you miss out on a disproportionate amount of REM. To make up for this, your body will adjust the following night and get more REM sleep at an earlier time.
“A great sign that you likely did not get enough sleep last night is that you are getting REM sleep too early in the night [tonight].” – Podcast 55: How Sleep Impacts Performance
For the most part, a sleep disorder or anything that hurts your sleep will generally negatively impact your REM sleep patterns as well. Consuming alcohol before going to bed is one thing that is particularly bad for REM. From another episode of the WHOOP Podcast:
“Alcohol is a sedative, it’s not actually a sleeping aid. Sleep is an incredibly active process, our bodies are working really, really hard when we sleep, and if you have alcohol in your system, none of those very active processes can happen. … If you think about your typical sleep cycle, you fall asleep, within a couple minutes you typically see your first slow-wave sleep episode, that’s the physically restorative part of sleep, when you’re sedated that just doesn’t happen at all. Alcohol actually disproportionately crushes REM sleep, the mentally restorative part of sleep. … You miss your first big REM episode, you miss a lot of slow-wave sleep, you just get a lot of light sleep. You don’t achieve what the point of sleep is actually.”",10/26/21

Your sleep consistency is a measure of your bed and wake times. Going to bed and waking up close to the same times each day helps your circadian rhythm function.
Sleep consistency is an important factor in getting enough sleep. High sleep consistency means you are going to bed and getting up close to the same times each day. Low sleep consistency indicates a more variable night-to-night sleep timing. Just like it is for children, having a set bedtime is important for adults, too.
Keeping regular hours helps your body maintain its natural circadian rhythm, allowing you to feel tired around the same time each night. Your body likes routine and wants to anticipate the onset of sleep.
If you’re having trouble getting to sleep each night, having a bedtime routine can help you increase sleep efficiency and consistency.

The Sleep Planner uses all the elements listed above to calculate the exact amount of sleep you need each night. WHOOP factors your individual circadian rhythm, daily strain, and sleep debt, and also incorporates whether you want to get 100% of your sleep need, perform with 85%, or get by with 75% of your sleep need. WHOOP automatically tracks your sleep down to the minute including time spent in light, deep, and REM sleep, and when you’re awake.

The WHOOP Sleep Planner calculates exactly how much sleep you need each night.",2/22/22
how-much-sleep-do-adults-need,How Much Sleep Do Adults Need?,"Factors Affecting How Much Sleep You Need
Sleep debt is a measure of how much sleep you get versus how much you need. For example, if your body needs 7 hours but you only get 5 you have 2 hours of sleep debt. Getting enough sleep each night can be a challenge, but not getting enough sleep may lead to consequences such as decreased alertness, poor concentration, anxiety, and reduced coordination.
Naps: Taking a nap during the day can affect your ability to fall asleep that night. That doesn’t mean you should avoid napping during the day. If you were short on sleep the night before, a nap allows you to catch up on your sleep debt.
A short power nap of 20 minutes or so can increase alertness and put you in a better mood. On the other hand, a long nap of about 90 minutes is generally the length of a full sleep cycle and will let you spend time in each sleep stage. If you’re sleep deprived, a 90-minute nap may enable you to feel rested and rejuvenated for the rest of the day. Many elite athletes make napping a part of their game-day schedule and training routine. Pilots from major airlines also use naps to handle red-eye flights.
Daily strain: Your daily activity can affect how much sleep you need at night. If you’re commuting, dealing with kids’ activities and homework, chores, and getting a workout in, you’ll need more sleep than if you spent the day on the couch. Exercise can also help you sleep more soundly and get to sleep faster.",2/22/22
how-much-sleep-do-adults-need,How Much Sleep Do Adults Need?,"Sleep Efficiency and Disruptions
You may spend 8 hours each night in bed, but you’re almost certainly not sleeping the full time. Sleep efficiency measures how much of that time is spent actually asleep. The factors above can affect your sleep efficiency.
WHOOP members tend to average 7:30 hours of sleep for every 8 hours in bed. Monitoring your sleep efficiency can help you understand how much of your time in bed is spent awake and make changes in your bedtime habits if you’re not getting enough sleep.
Health can have a major effect on sleep efficiency. Illness, chronic pain, and injuries may hinder your ability to get to sleep and sleep through the night. Chronic pain can cause frequent sleep disturbances and things like respiratory infections can leave you feeling unrested when you wake.
Sleep problems including sleep apnea, circadian rhythm disorders, and insomnia also affect how much sleep you’re getting.
Pregnancy impacts a multitude of systems and functions, including your ability to fall and stay asleep. In general, pregnant people need more sleep, but pregnancy can cause leg cramps, nausea, and increased resting heart rate and respiratory rate. Pregnancy may also cause obstructive sleep apnea and heartburn. All of these are disruptions that often result in low sleep efficiency and a poor night’s sleep.",2/22/22

Baseline: Your baseline sleep need is the amount of sleep you should get every night prior to other factors coming into play. It is determined by your physiology, which WHOOP begins to learn about as soon as you put on the Strap.
Strain: WHOOP quantifies the strain (cardiovascular exertion) your body takes on from things like exercise, stress and normal daily activities. The more strain you accumulate during the day, the more sleep you need at night.
Sleep Debt: When you don’t get all the sleep you need at night, you start to build up sleep debt. In the WHOOP app, sleep debt refers to the amount of extra sleep your body requires tonight due to insufficient sleep on previous nights.
Naps: If you take a nap during the day, your sleep need that night is reduced by the amount of time you napped for.

We fully understand that life can often get in the way of achieving your ideal amount of sleep on a regular basis. So, what should you aim for when that’s not possible? Is 7 hours of sleep enough? What about 6?
Again, it depends on circumstances and varies for everyone. The WHOOP Sleep Planner allows for this by giving you the option to set your daily performance goals to “peak,” “perform,” or “get by.” You can also adjust these settings based on the day of the week. For example, you may want to “peak” on Monday for a busy work day, but are fine to just “get by” on a lazy Saturday.
The Sleep Planner will then recommend an amount of time to spend in bed in order to reach your desired goal. “Peak” represents meeting 100% of your sleep need, “perform” sets you up to hit 85%, and “get by” puts you on track for 70%.
## Your Best Time to Sleep and Wake Up
Beyond simply suggesting how much time to spend in bed at night, the Sleep Planner uses recent scientific discoveries on the value of sleep consistency and incorporates your natural circadian rhythm to offer the most effective times for you to go to bed and wake up (see screenshot above).
You can also specify your intended wake-up time and the Sleep Planner will adjust your advised bedtime accordingly. Each evening, the WHOOP app sends you a notification as well with your recommended sleep need and optimal time to go to sleep.

Getting enough sleep is an essential aspect of human performance. It is a critical component to our overall health, and allows the body to repair and restore itself in preparation for the day ahead.
While 8 hours of sleep per night is a commonly accepted goal, every human body is different and we all have different sleep needs. Additionally, there are various other factors (previous nights’ sleep, stress, activity level, etc.) that affect the amount of sleep you need on a nightly basis.

Below I’ve shared two examples of a weekly training plan for a competitive distance runner. The first is when the athlete’s body is generally well recovered, the second is when it is not.
Chart 1: Increased training volume when your body is well recovered.
Chart 2: Decreased training volume when your body is poorly recovered.
In Chart 1, the athlete has a week of generally high-quality recovery, which means the mileage is higher, the weight training volume is higher, and there are only a couple rest/active recovery (mobility) days. In Chart 2, since the athlete’s recovery is lower all week, the mileage is less, there are more rest days, and there is less intensity (quantified by WHOOP as strain, a measure of cardiovascular exertion on a 0-21 scale).
Optimizing performance is directly correlated with recovery. If you are training at a high volume, or for a race, plan on sleeping and resting just as hard as you train!

I signed up for WHOOP that same month. This was the first time I hadn’t just “ran” while training. I trained smart. I based my workouts on the quality of my sleep. With WHOOP, I was more “in the know” with my body than ever before.
I set a goal to run 50 miles at LMS. I had never run 50 miles before and decided hitting that marker would be gold for me.
As it turned out, I completed 67 miles of my ultra marathon, 4 miles every hour for 16 hours.
Accomplishing this felt great. But I later learned the true victory was in the small epiphanies I had during training, the strategic steps I took in order to achieve what I achieved. What I learned throughout my training ultimately transformed me, both as a coach and as a runner.
Training more intelligently leads to greater self-efficacy because there is little room for doubt. Greater self-efficacy leads to success.
I’ve been using WHOOP ever since. Having scientific-backed data behind “how I feel today” has taught me how to make non-negotiable decisions when it comes to training.
So back to the original question…",2/25/22
how-often-should-you-run,How Often Should You Run to Optimize Training?,"As a running coach, I’m frequently asked, “What should my weekly mileage goal be?” and “How many times a week should I run?”
To which I usually respond, “Well, that’s a really complex question.” Yet regardless of their complexity, I honestly like hearing these questions. Nine times out of ten, it demonstrates the athlete is already intrinsically motivated (they want to get better at running because they enjoy it), which is sometimes the toughest barrier to overcome when it comes to commitment.
## Why Do You Want to Run? How Does Your Body Respond to Training?
Runners who ask “how” instead of “why,” usually have a strong desire to lock a system into place to optimize their performance. My job as a coach is to help design and make that system actionable.
Once you’ve defined your “why,” whether it’s an upcoming race, or maybe just a desire to run pain free, your next step is to learn how your body responds to training. How your body responds to training allows you to determine how to progress in training. Every training plan is unique. Not all feet strike the same. Not all runners have the same pace.
Most runners think the more they run, the easier it gets. And while mileage is undoubtedly important, the volume of the miles run doesn’t matter nearly as much as the quality of them.
Running is really demanding. Honestly, I’m slightly offended by how much running has literally “run me into the ground” at times, both mentally and physically. Luckily, in 2019 I discovered WHOOP, which changed my entire outlook on running, personally and professionally.",2/25/22
how-often-should-you-run,How Often Should You Run to Optimize Training?,"How Often Should I Run? The Importance of Sleep & Recovery
Your body‘s ability to perform is based on the quality of your recovery. Balancing these two metrics allows you to create a successful system. Creating a successful system leads to success with your training. Once you see progress, it’s harder to quit. And as a fellow runner, if I’m putting in the work, I want it to work.
Think of it like this: A fully charged Tesla will go further than a half-charged Tesla, and a fully charged body will run further than a half-charged body. That is why sleep is so important.
There are 4 stages of sleep: Wake (periods of time when you’re awake throughout the night), light sleep (the transition stage to deep sleep), SWS (physically restorative sleep), and REM (mentally restorative sleep). How much time you spend in each stage will help determine the quality of your recovery. In order to optimize performance, you want to save the more intense training for when your body is fully recovered.
A significant part of this is getting quality sleep in the two major restorative phases: REM and SWS (which stands for slow wave sleep). These sleep stages improve nervous system function, repair muscle tissue, and promote growth hormones. And as I’m sure you can imagine, optimizing running performance after deep sleep is much easier than trying to perform when your body isn’t prepared to.
When you optimize performance based on recovery, you get to do cooler things like improve running efficiency so you learn how to expend less energy running further distances. You can do this because your body is primed to run efficiently.
You can run and train more efficiently when your body is properly recovered.",2/25/22
how-often-should-you-run,How Often Should You Run to Optimize Training?,"Improve Running Efficiency with Training Based on Recovery
Running efficiency includes everything from the mechanics in your stride cycle, to your ability to control your pace. These factors directly affect how far and how fast you run. Your gait cycle (how your foot hits the ground and what happens in the kinetic chain) can be affected by muscle imbalances which cause you to expend more energy than necessary.
Incorporating runner-specific strength training, along with mobility, helps the body move more efficiently and with more power. The stronger you are, the less energy you expend while running. And you guessed it, your body’s ability to run efficiently depends on the quality of your recovery.
The Project PR running study done by WHOOP is a great example of how recovery affects performance. In this study, every week, participants had a mix of running workouts, including intervals, hill sprints and recovery runs.
For participants following the static training plan, runners had a singular workout regimen each day. Other participants following the dynamic plan had to adjust their workouts based on their red, yellow, or green WHOOP recovery (a daily metric for how prepared your body is to perform which incorporates sleep, heart rate variability, and other key vitals) with 3 corresponding options to choose from.
The findings concluded: “On average, participants who modulated workouts based on recovery were up to 32.4% less likely to experience injury than those who followed a static plan. These injuries were self-reported and ranged from common injuries such as shin splints and achilles tendonitis to more sidelining injuries, like a pulled muscle or stress reaction.”
In addition to that, the study showed that participants using WHOOP were more likely to prioritize hours of sleep and recovery protocol, and they improved 5k performance by doing less work compared to the control counterparts.
Recovery is just as important to progress as performance is.

how-stress-impacts-sleep-patterns,How Does Stress Impact Our Sleep Patterns?,"The Relationship Between Stress and Sleep
What is stress’ impact on sleep? The relationship between stress and sleep is considered to be bidirectional. High-stress levels can cause disruptions in sleep cycles, and poor sleep can contribute to stress. Chronic stress is the primary type of stress that impacts sleep in the long run. With chronic stress, the body is in an activated fight-or-flight state for an extended period.
Since the nervous system is constantly in this heightened readiness mode to deal with a threat, it primes the body to stay alert 24/7. This can manifest as racing, anxious thoughts at night, which can get in the way of falling and staying asleep.
Once poor sleep starts to become a pattern and recur over time due to chronic stress, sleep deprivation occurs. Stress-related systems are triggered further when the body doesn’t get adequate sleep.
For example, the increased stress hormone cortisol is produced in response to sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation can also add to emotional stress by increasing feelings of anxiety, irritability, and trouble focusing during the day.
## Sleep and Stress Symptoms
Stress has a generally negative effect on sleep quality and the consistency of sleep cycles, but it also shows up in more specific ways. One of the most common sleep disorders—insomnia—is typically rooted in stress. Short-term insomnia is commonly linked to acute stress or a traumatic experience. Insomnia, in the long term, is often a result of chronic stress.
Other examples of how sleep and stress symptoms can manifest include changes in the stages of the sleep cycles. One of the most significant ways stress can disrupt the sleep cycle is by reducing the restful, deep sleep you get each night. Sleep deprivation can also change the natural pattern of your sleep cycle by causing you to get more REM sleep earlier in the night than you ideally should.",4/11/23
how-stress-impacts-sleep-patterns,How Does Stress Impact Our Sleep Patterns?,"Sleep plays a crucial role in how well we can function daily—yet, the importance of quality sleep is often overlooked. Not getting enough restful sleep can have wide-ranging adverse effects on physical and mental health. Poor sleep can cause difficulties with concentration, memory, and decision-making, and it can weaken the immune system. It can also contribute to stress and mood disorders and increase the risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure.
Research indicates that getting regular, restful sleep is essential, but meeting this goal remains challenging for many adults. The CDC reports around 1 in 3 U.S. adults gets less than the recommended minimum of 7 hours of sleep each night.
As stress is one aspect of daily life that significantly impacts sleep quality and sleep patterns, incorporating stress management strategies into your routine can help improve your sleep.
## What is Stress?
Stress is a natural response to difficulties and changes in our environment that shows up in the body and mind. Stress can affect the body in two main ways — in the short-term through acute stress, and over a long period of time through chronic stress.
Acute stress is usually experienced in response to specific events, like a car crash or stressful work event, while more long-term issues, such as chronic health conditions or a high-pressure job, cause chronic stress.",4/11/23

Learning to manage your stress is the best way to minimize its impact on sleep and to prevent many of the negative ways stress affects the body overall. Many stress management techniques may be incorporated into your nightly routine to promote relaxation and improved sleep quality. Some expert-tested and recommended stress-reducing techniques include:
### 1. Develop a Sleep Schedule
Sleep consistency is essential for meeting various goals, from seeing results from your fitness efforts to getting quality sleep. Try maintaining a regular sleep schedule, falling asleep and waking up at the same time each day — during the week and on the weekend. This promotes a regular sleep cycle, and WHOOP found that those who get the most consistent sleep also get more SWS and REM Sleep, too.
### 2. Improve Sleep Hygiene
Sleep hygiene is an approach to improving sleep that involves adding healthy habits to your evening routine. This includes avoiding alcohol and caffeine later in the day and not eating right before bed. Minimizing screen time and maintaining a cool, dark, quiet sleep environment are other useful strategies.
### 3. Prioritize Daytime Exercise
Regular exercise helps improve both stress relief and sleep quality. The endorphins released by working out boost mood and energy levels. A consistent fitness routine is linked to increased sleep and higher quality sleep. It’s best to schedule workouts during the day rather than at night to optimize the positive effect of exercise on rest.",4/11/23
how-stress-impacts-sleep-patterns,How Does Stress Impact Our Sleep Patterns?,"4. Schedule Worry Time
Anxious thoughts are one of the most common stress symptoms that can get in the way of falling asleep at night. Managing these thoughts in a constructive, scheduled way during the day can keep them from disrupting your sleep. If you’re dealing with a lot of stress in your life, try scheduling a block of worry time in the morning or afternoon so you can spend structured time considering and strategizing about your anxieties and stressors.
### 5. Engage in Breathwork
Practicing breathwork is another proven strategy to help you reduce stress and improve sleep. The cyclic sigh, or physiological sigh, is a proven breathing technique that can reduce stress levels quickly and effectively, and is available through the Stress Monitor feature.",4/11/23

26. Use progressive muscle relaxation
Similar to the military method, but not as fast, progressive muscle relaxation (PMR), also known as deep muscle relaxation, helps you unwind by tensing each muscle group in turn and relaxing it. The technique is used to control stress and reduce symptoms of chronic pain, in addition to sending you to dreamland.
Inhale and contract one muscle group (your eyebrows and forehead for example) for 5-10 seconds, then relax.
Wait 10 seconds and tense another muscle group.
It’s often helpful to start at the top of the head or at the feet and work your way methodically through the muscle groups.
You may not finish tensing and relaxing before you fall asleep, and that’s OK.
### 27. Try paradoxical intention
27. Try paradoxical intention
Tell yourself you’re not tired and to stay awake. That may put you right to sleep.
Paradoxical intention is one method people with insomnia use to get relief. Trying to sleep can create performance anxiety. If you find yourself stressed and anxiously looking at the clock give this method a shot.

Possible symptoms of low blood oxygen levels include:
Shortness of breath
Heavy breathing
Chest pains
Elevated heart rate
Increased blood pressure
Dizziness
Loss of coordination
Confusion
Headaches
Impaired vision
Cyanosis
Beyond certain medical conditions, low levels of oxygen in your blood can also be the result of changes in your environment–for example, transitioning to a higher altitude where there is a smaller percentage of oxygen in the air.
## Track Your Blood Oxygen Level with WHOOP
Most common pulse oximeters track SpO2 from your finger. We implement the same technology to monitor blood oxygen on your wrist, along with a number of other vital signs and key physiological metrics like resting heart rate, heart rate variability, respiratory rate, skin temperature, and sleep.
WHOOP calculates your blood oxygen level during sleep each night (when your body is in its most restful state) to ensure the most reliable and consistent readings. You can check your SpO2 each morning via the Health Monitor feature.
The WHOOP Health monitor tracks your blood oxygen level and other valuable physiological metrics.

## What Does Blood Oxygen Level Mean?
Your blood oxygen level is simply the amount of oxygen present in your blood. The most common method for measuring it is a process called pulse oximetry (more on that later). If your blood oxygen level drops too low, it can be a sign or symptom of various medical issues.
In order to function properly, your body requires a constant supply of oxygen. After it is breathed into the lungs, oxygen is transferred to your bloodstream and circulated through your body in red blood cells. Blood oxygen level is an indication of how much oxygen is being distributed to your body by the red blood cells, and maintaining the proper balance of oxygen saturation is very important for your overall health.
## What Should Your Blood Oxygen Level Be?
Pulse oximeters read your blood oxygen level by shining light through capillary veins near your skin’s surface. They measure it as a percentage, also referred to as SpO2.
A normal blood oxygen level can range from 95-100%. That number is often lower for people with lung diseases or other specific health issues. Blood oxygen levels that fall below 90% are considered quite low. This is called hypoxemia, and may suggest a need to seek medical attention (in particular with cases of COVID-19).",11/18/21

### 5. Eat a Healthy Diet
Eating a well-balanced, nutritious diet promotes overall health and puts your body in an excellent position to deal with the negative effects of stress. New research links some specific foods you can add to your diet to stress reduction: For example, research indicates that vegetables and omega-3s might play a role in moderating cortisol levels in the body. A healthy diet also prevents the negative impact on HRV that poor nutrition can cause.
### 6. Think About What You Can Control
A significant part of stress is feeling like you’re out of control or have no way to change the negative situation that you’re in. One way to manage stress is to think about and focus on the parts of your life you can control.
For example, focus on optimizing your diet, trying new activities linked to stress relief, maintaining a consistent weekly routine, improving sleep hygiene and completing household chores. Feeling in control of your life and stressors promotes vagus nerve stimulation, which supports optimal interactions between the nervous and cardiovascular systems. This, in turn, increases HRV.",4/11/23
how-to-manage-stress,How to Manage Stress With Science,"What is Stress in the Body?
Stress is the overarching term that refers to the body’s built-in emotional and physical response to experiences that may be difficult, challenging, exciting, or overwhelming. If you’ve ever been under immense pressure or anxiety, you probably recognize the feelings: heavy chest, racing heart, tight muscles, and overall feeling of angst. When faced with upsetting circumstances, challenges beyond our control, or new and highly demanding situations, the mind and body react—and it often doesn’t feel great. That said, stress can also be positive, temporarily increasing our energy and focus, which can be helpful to prepare the body for action in stressful situations like giving a presentation.
In response to stress, hormones activate the sympathetic nervous system, or SNS, and trigger the ‘fight-or-flight’ response. Stress hormones, including cortisol and adrenaline, surge through the body, elevating heart, respiratory, and blood pressure.
This natural fight-or-flight response aims to help the body’s responsiveness to external stimuli, life-threatening or not. Ideally, once the threat has passed, the parasympathetic nervous system, or PNS, will be activated to reverse the changes induced by the SNS and return the body to homeostasis.
With constant or chronic stress, however, this natural calming process does not occur, and the body stays primed to deal with a threat. Research shows that persistent activation of the fight-or-flight response can take a severe toll on the body over time and may negatively impact the cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, endocrine and musculoskeletal systems.
When the PNS and SNS function optimally, they send signals to the body to help keep it balanced. This is measurable as heart rate variability or HRV, one of the key metrics that powers Stress Monitor. The interaction between the PNS signals the heart rate to decrease and the SNS telling it to produce fluctuations or variations that show up as HRV.",4/11/23

### 1. Incorporate Variety Into Your Training Regimen
When it comes to running faster, variety is key. If you’re doing the same 5-mile loop everyday you’ll maintain your fitness, but it’s unlikely you’ll gain speed.
“One of the biggest mistakes you can make is doing the same thing everyday. You get into ruts, and then you don’t feel motivated. Variety is what makes it fun, otherwise it’s boring. Mix it up. It’s better to be a well-rounded athlete and do things that challenge your endurance, strength, and speed, rather than doing the same thing all the time,” says Colleen.
“Some people don’t understand why I run an hour and 45 minutes on my long run when my race [on the track] is only 9 minutes long. It’s because I’m building cardio strength, which translates to the track when I’m doing a steeple workout. I can’t close in a race if I don’t have that.”
One of Colleen Quigley’s tips to be a better runner is to use a variety of crosstraining methods.
A typical week of running training for Colleen involves the following:
Anaerobic speed work: Faster, high-intensity reps with longer recovery
Tempo work: Increased sustained pace at 70-80% max HR
Hurdle & steeplechase drills: Exercises that improve form and technique
Long runs: Sustained comfortable pace to build endurance
Recovery runs: Easy pace to shakeout the legs
Cardio cross-training (swimming, spin): Supplemental work to improve cardiovascular fitness with low-impact

## “I Never Dreamed of Going to the Olympics”
If you ask Colleen Quiqley when she knew she wanted to be a runner, she’ll tell you she didn’t. Like most kids she tried a variety of sports at a young age, including dance and soccer. Her freshman year of high school she decided to join the cross-country team to stay in shape, but right away it was obvious that running was something she could take a lot further.
Two state titles and a “Gatorade Player of the Year” award later, Colleen became one of the top female runners to ever come out of St. Louis, Missouri. She continued her career at Florida State, a top D1 program, and immediately signed with Nike to train with the Bowerman Track Club after graduating.
Today, Colleen is paving her own path by forgoing the traditional shoe sponsorship model and encouraging positive change in the sport of track and field. She recently announced Lululemon as her apparel sponsor, which means she can run and train in any shoe she wants–and also work with additional partners like WHOOP to prioritize self-care and become the best athlete she can be.",6/10/21
how-to-run-faster-colleen-quiqley,5 Tips on How to Run Faster from Olympian Colleen Quiqley,"3. Personalize Training to Your Specific Needs
Since declining to renew her 4-year contract with Nike in 2020, Colleen has been vocal about her experience during that period, which had its ups and downs. In the cutthroat world of track and field (especially in the United States, which is the hardest Olympic team to make), it’s easy to forget that athletes are real human beings with complex needs, both physically and emotionally. Producing stellar performances over and over again is not possible without a deep level of personalization to minimize risk of injury and improve speed.
Colleen found WHOOP back in September of 2020 as she looked to fine-tune her training during her transition from Nike. “I felt that WHOOP looked at my day as a whole and gave me super specific feedback on how everything was affecting me,” she notes.
a downward trend in her daily WHOOP recovery lets Colleen Quigley know she may want to modulate her training load.
“For someone who’s so competitive like me, I hate feeling like I’m not doing the most I can. The easiest example of this is the second run during the day. When you’re training with a group of 10 women who are all doing 3 or 4 doubles a week, it’s so hard to say ‘I’m not going to do that’, even if I know it’s not best for me. I just know for myself if I run twice a day more than once a week, I can only do that for so long before something’s going to break.”

At FSU, Colleen majored in dietetics and thought she’d pursue a career in nutrition before running pro became a reality. She grew up in a family that taught her how to have a healthy relationship with food, which allowed her to succeed as a young, growing athlete.
“We had a really big garden in our backyard. We had chickens that laid eggs for us, we had this ideal relationship with food where you use whole foods–you chop, sauté, and bake. You make food, you prepare it,” she explains.
A healthy diet helps improve Colleen Quigley’s WHOOP recovery after working out.
“I have an appreciation for how cooking food and preparing food makes you feel and the [sense of] community that breeds. When you break bread and share a meal with someone that creates a special bond. And of course you have the performance aspect of that too. I feel better when I eat good food. I have better energy, I can fight inflammation, I feel fueled for workouts, and I recover faster after my workouts, so I’m ready for the next one. Even if you don’t consider yourself an intense athlete, eating good food will make you feel better in everyday life.”",6/10/21

According to Colleen, if you hate running, you’re scared of it, or you think you’re not good enough, it’s all about reframing your mindset. Culture tends to view running as a punishment. If you lose, you have to run. It’s extremely tough on the body, which means pain is inevitable and there’s an intense psychological barrier. Even for elite athletes, getting back in shape is hard work.
“You do have to get in shape before it becomes fun. That means working through some of the beginning awkwardness, feeling heavy in your legs and tired, like you don’t know what you’re doing. You have to just push through that for a while before you feel that runner’s high,” she says.
“I always tell people don’t lose heart if at first it’s not what you imagined. It doesn’t mean you’re a bad runner, it just means you haven’t done it enough yet. You just have to stick with it.”",6/10/21
how-to-run-faster-colleen-quiqley,5 Tips on How to Run Faster from Olympian Colleen Quiqley,"4. Use Data to Your Advantage
Trusting your gut only goes so far. While it’s important to pay attention to how you feel, having concrete data to validate your needs (or tell you something you didn’t expect!) makes training so much easier.
“WHOOP is a more scientific way to measure things,” Colleen says. “I always feel like I’m second guessing myself, especially with the overtraining. My natural inclination is to tough it out. But when I have something like WHOOP that gives me real data, I have biological markers that tell me I’m tired 4 or 5 days in a row. I’m overreaching, not just for one day, but multiple days on end.”
“I can say ‘See, my HRV is really low! I knew I wasn’t recovering well.’ I can give myself some grace.”
checking her STRAIN data in the WHOOP app Helps Colleen Quigley avoid overtraining.
Colleen also uses the WHOOP Journal to monitor recovery modalities including supplements, using her Hypervolt, compression boots, meditation, and more. She credits the journal to holding her accountable for behaviors she knows she should be doing. “When I see the pop-up [in the app], it’s like this little reminder that holds me accountable.”",6/10/21

On the other hand, a 30% step reduction in training volume in the second group did not result in any significant improvement in physical performance on the same measures.
This study shows a clear correlation between performance and tapering. The athletes with a 50% reduction in training load yielded better performance results than the athletes who only had a 30% decrease.
## The most common mistake runners make during their taper
I’ve witnessed it with athletes I’ve trained, and I’m guilty of it myself: The most common mistake runners usually make while tapering is doing those “extra few workouts” in the weeks leading up to race day. Why do we tend to do this? Because our fear of “losing fitness” during the taper can be real. But while those extra few workouts may be temporarily mentally satisfying, they come with a cost. My best advice? Keep training, just scale back intensity.
Human performance works like a battery, to save power you have to decrease output.
Tapering is basically maintenance. The golden rule for fresh legs and a clear head on race day is to get behind the starting line with a full tank. The additional workouts you feel you need to do during the taper aren’t the answer to nailing your goal marathon pace. The work has already been put in, now it’s time to recover, prepare, and preserve.",4/5/22

Now that you’re not spending as much time and effort on training, you can fill up that spare time up with mobility work, injury-prevention drills, easy paced runs, and preparation–like what you’re going to wear and other race-day logistics. This not only eliminates room for error during your race, but also keeps the forward momentum.
Rolling: IT band syndrome and runner’s knee are the most common overuse injuries amongst distance runners. The IT band doesn’t stretch though, so don’t waste your time static stretching. Oftentimes, knee pain is a result of ITBS. I suggest using a tennis or golf ball, or do trigger point of foam rolling. This allows for more accurate, pinpointed, release of the muscles which are tight. Do this every day until race day.
Ice baths: Enable blood vessels to constrict which reduces inflammation and aids in repairing broken down muscle tissue (15 minutes max, 2-3 times a week).
Epsom salt baths: Increase blood flow to muscles (do these 2-3 times a week).
Cupping: Releasing the muscles from the bone improves blood flow which allows for nutrient delivery to increase.
IV vitamin and hydration shots: This is a great way to ensure your body has all the hydration, and vitamins and minerals it needs to perform.
Sleep: Now more than ever is a great time to make sure you’re getting your best sleep!

Another common mistake people make while tapering is resting too much. Recovery requires movement. Just not as much movement. Which leads me to my next point, that the tough part about tapering is knowing what’s too much and what’s too little.
I hate to say it, but the best way to figure this out is through trial and error. A runner who is aiming for a sub 3-hour marathon finish will have an entirely different taper plan than someone who’s aiming for closer to a 4-hour finish.
A typical training week during the taper period just before a marathon, based on experience level.",4/5/22
how-to-taper-before-a-marathon,How to Taper Before a Marathon Like a Pro,"What Tapering is and Why it’s Important
The goal of the marathon taper is to preserve the neurological and physiological adaptations you’ve already acquired throughout your training in the past months. This is accomplished by reducing volume (miles) and intensity (effort) in the last few weeks leading up to your race. Don’t get it twisted though, those past few months of grueling workouts weren’t for nothing! The progress you’ve made doesn’t disappear overnight.
The taper typically falls on the weeks following the longest run in your marathon training cycle. The average marathon training cycle lasts anywhere from 16-20 weeks, based on your level of experience (20 weeks being for less experienced runners). Tapering, depending on the duration of the training cycle, can range anywhere from the final 3-4 weeks leading up to race day (for more novice runners), to just the last 1-2 weeks. In these last few weeks the mileage and intensity can decrease anywhere from 10-40%, depending on the athlete’s level of fitness.
Your level of experience determines how much you should taper before a marathon.
The general gist? Cut back your volume and intensity so your body is prepared to handle a high strain on race day. The demanding, high-effort, high-mileage workouts are already behind you. All you have to do from here is maintain your baseline.
In WHOOP terminology, stay “in the green” with your daily recovery as best you can during the weeks leading up to your race. So yes, you can still run. In fact, you need to. You can even do speed work or lift, just remember at this point less is more. For example, instead of doing half or quarter repeats, maybe you do 100-meter strides.",4/5/22
how-to-taper-before-a-marathon,How to Taper Before a Marathon Like a Pro,"The mental side of tapering
Tapering is both mental and physical. Your success depends on two factors:
1) How primed your body is to perform 2) The collective feedback from your training
1) How primed your body is to perform 2) The collective feedback from your training
Collective feedback is your interpretation of both objective and subjective feedback from your training. Objective feedback being pace and mileage; subjective feedback being emotions, effort, or pain. When you run, your body sends signals to your brain and how you interpret those signals often determines the outcome of your run. Running is an activity for the body and mind, it requires both mental and physical endurance.
Now let’s be real, how many runs have you had where you tell yourself, “Today, I will run at an easy effort,” but then you end up with a new personal best? It can happen to all of us. Runners often base pace off perceived effort, but perceived effort isn’t always in line with what we should be doing in terms of intensity.
Physically, workouts during your taper should feel like you can “do more,” or push harder, but you don’t. This requires patience.
Well-rounded distance runners have a strong sense of self-awareness, confidence, and self-control, which is a great mentality. They also tend to have another trait in common–relentless forward progression. The only way out is through. Pretty badass if you ask me, but save that energy and mentality for race day. Tapering is a time to practice self-awareness and patience. The neurological and physiological adaptations your body needs for race day have already been acquired in the past few months of training. Be confident in that. Seriously.",4/5/22

As a coach and a runner, I would be remiss not to mention how physically and mentally uncomfortable tapering can be. If you know, you know: Not running as much, especially after running at a high volume, can leave a lot to be desired from your body and mind. During my clients’ taper, I usually hear: “I feel like I should be doing more even though I know I’m supposed to be doing less.” Physically it’s common to feel lethargic too, which is not what you want on race day. Luckily, all of this is completely normal!
Reducing volume and intensity is necessary for every marathon taper, regardless of the athlete’s pace. And while there isn’t one “right formula” for everyone – a world-class athlete like Meb Keflezighi will usually taper for about 11 days out, while a less experienced runner will take anywhere from 3-4 weeks to taper – there are tips and guidelines you can use to get the most out of it.",4/5/22

Tracking and analyzing sleep is central to the WHOOP membership experience. Our heavy focus on sleep is motivated by decades of research and irrefutable evidence that sleep is essential for recovery and performance. Getting enough sleep is harder now than ever before, Gallup poll data shows that Americans today average over an hour less sleep per night than we did 70 years ago.
The current epidemic of sleep deprivation not only makes us sleepier, but increases our risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer and obesity, and shortens our life expectancy. WHOOP members are, on average, doing far better than the national trend, but still benefit from improving their sleep. Below we break down from the beginning how we built the WHOOP Sleep Analytics platform.",2/20/20
how-well-whoop-measures-sleep,"How Does WHOOP Measure Sleep, and How Accurate is It?","We are proud to announce that the University of Arizona recently completed an independent validation of our sleep staging analytics, which was published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine. In this study, participants’ sleep was studied using polysomnography (PSG), the gold-standard of sleep tracking, while also wearing WHOOP. The study overwhelmingly showed that the accuracy of WHOOP was excellent when compared to PSG, thus demonstrating WHOOP to be a reliable, non-invasive wearable for sleep tracking.
According to Dr. Sairam Parthasarathy, MD, who is a professor of medicine at the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Tucson and director of the Center for Sleep and Circadian Sciences, “The accuracy of WHOOP as a wearable and its availability compared to the limited accessibility of polysomnography may in the future facilitate better population-health management.”
To summarize the study’s key findings:
The WHOOP sleeping respiratory rate algorithm was shown to be within 1 breath per minute of gold standard truth.
The WHOOP sleeping heart rate was shown to be within 1 beat per minute of EKG.
Using WHOOP was shown to be associated with improvements to sleep quality.
WHOOP sleep staging had high levels of agreement with polysomnography testing.

how-well-whoop-measures-sleep,"How Does WHOOP Measure Sleep, and How Accurate is It?","A Peek Behind The Curtain
Some of the differences in your data between sleep stages are pretty easy to spot, while others can be more subtle. For example, below is about 80 minutes of respiratory rate data from one of my recent sleeps. The light blue highlighted segment shows slow wave sleep while the teal segment shows REM sleep. The unhighlighted portions are light sleep. Notice that the respiratory rate during slow wave sleep is fairly constant while during REM sleep it is increased and more variable.
The image above shows just one of many physiological differences among sleep stages that can be detected by WHOOP. In reality, our sleep staging algorithm brings together lots of physiological variables – called “features” in the algorithm development world – but not all the features are as pronounced to the naked eye.
## So How Accurate Are We?
Dr. Sairam Parthasarathy, medical director for the Center for Sleep Disorders at The University of Arizona’s University Medical Center Tucson, and his team, who conducted the validation study published last week found that WHOOP accurately detects sleep duration with a precision of 17.8 minutes. They also reported highly accurate detection of REM and Slow Wave (deep) sleep.

how-well-whoop-measures-sleep,"How Does WHOOP Measure Sleep, and How Accurate is It?","How We Test WHOOP
In order to turn our accelerometer, heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate into all the sleep analysis our members receive each day, we partnered with a local sleep center and had hundreds of subjects undergo in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG) testing while wearing WHOOP.
In a PSG sleep study, subjects undergo simultaneous electrocardiogram (EKG), electrooculogram (EOG), electroencephalogram (EEG), and electromyogram (EMG) recordings. Trained technicians then manually interpret these results, sorting each 30-second chunk of data – called an Epoch – into one of four sleep stages: Wake, Light, REM, and Slow Wave. While PSG is the gold standard, and therefore the most accurate known way to determine sleep stages, it is also expensive, cumbersome and intrusive.
In our recent study with the University of Arizona, we show that we are able to achieve an approximation of the PSG data from WHOOP, enabling our users to access this powerful data with virtually no friction. We achieved this by training machine learning algorithms to reproduce the sleep stages manually assigned by the polysomnography technicians to create the automated sleep-staging experience provided today.
Having subjects wear WHOOP while undergoing PSG testing is critical to enabling the high level of accuracy we’ve attained because we are able to teach the model to recognize exactly what WHOOP data looks like during each of the four sleep stages we detect.",2/20/20
how-well-whoop-measures-sleep,"How Does WHOOP Measure Sleep, and How Accurate is It?","Purpose-Built For Sleep
Your WHOOP strap was designed from the ground up to provide the most accurate possible sleep tracking, we collect hundreds of data points per second from our 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope, and PPG-heart rate sensor. WHOOP also measures capacitive touch and temperature but does not use data from those sensors in its sleep algorithm.
PPG, or photoplethysmography, is a technique that involves measuring blood flow by assessing superficial changes in blood volume. If you’ve ever wondered what the tiny green lights are on the bottom of your WHOOP, they are the very important first part of PPG. Between the two green lights there is a small photo-receptor which measures light. When you shine specific colors (wavelengths) of light onto the skin, blood volume can be measured by looking at the light reflected back from our skin since blood absorbs specific colors and reflects others.
Once blood flow is measured, we can then derive heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate, all of which are used in our sleep detection and staging algorithms. In the recently published sleep validation study, WHOOP HR during sleep was shown to have excellent agreement with EKG, the gold standard, averaging a precision error of 1 beat per minute across 32 participants. The study similarly found excellent agreement between our respiratory rate and gold standard measurements, averaging precision error of one breath per minute. Having highly accurate HR and respiratory rate is essential to accurately staging sleep.",2/20/20

What I truly appreciate is the perspective I’ve gained on my body’s performance and recovery. In particular, that “bad” days were reframed as “seeing my own strength come through when my body wasn’t giving me optimal circumstances.” I love that. I’m proud of that.

how-whoop-drove-my-confident-comeback,How WHOOP Drove My Confident Comeback,"When summer hit, I advanced to a marathon training plan and added some serious tempo runs to my schedule. Inevitably, a day rolled around when a workout I expected to be able to do was entirely out of my grasp. Every footfall was difficult. I took a lot of walk breaks. I felt so slow! Once again, I questioned my inner governor’s ability to make my legs move. Cue the internal beat down!
I got home, angrily chucked off my Garmin, and a few minutes later my WHOOP notified me that it had calculated my workout. “Great,” I thought sarcastically, “I can’t wait to see what an easy run I just sucked so hard at.”
But when I opened the app, suddenly my whole perspective shifted. High Strain! WHOOP gave me an “all out effort” rating. It was like divine confirmation, “Yeah, that was freakin’ hard! You worked your butt off, be proud!” Suddenly, the time registered on my watch didn’t matter. I was clearly a badass for even getting out there and working at that rate for as long as I did.
The notion that my body doesn’t operate exactly the same from day to day, that there are genuine “bad days” that have nothing to do with inner strength (or even outer strength) was completely novel. Now, instead of feeling defeated on my “bad day,” I felt totally encouraged.
Using my WHOOP as my adjudicator and modifying my training plan accordingly, I navigated my way through the season. I hit new PRs for 5k, 10k, and 20 miles, something that, at 37 years old, I never thought could happen. When I started training for the marathon, I had no real expectations other than to complete the race pain-free, and perhaps finish in under five hours. But when race day finally arrived, I matched my second-best marathon time ever (4:35) and loved every minute of it.",1/29/18
how-whoop-drove-my-confident-comeback,How WHOOP Drove My Confident Comeback,"The first thing that woke me up to myself was the Recovery metric. My body was all but screaming at me for rest. I could clearly see that I was doing a better job of healing when I ditched my prescribed pain meds (unsurprisingly, opioids were doing me more harm than good). And alcohol? Forget it. Talk about something that ruins my sleep! Despite my newfound self-awareness, it was still months before I saw Recoveries consistently “in the green.”
I returned to exercise two weeks post-surgery, but because of my WHOOP, I didn’t try anything extreme. My body was sending clear signals that it wasn’t time to go all-out yet (that time didn’t come for nearly three months). Using my WHOOP data as a guide, I scaled back my workouts. I purposely kept my max heart rate down in the 145-150 range, even when running.
And I waited.
While it was a practice in checking my ego at the door, I could clearly see that I was slowly getting stronger. Most importantly, I had no pain, no muscle cramping, and no setbacks. By March, I knew it was finally “go time” and I hit the track for the first time in years. It was amazing. I felt incredible!
After that, I ramped up my workouts and began to make some real progress in terms of strength and stamina. I finally felt like my old self again, only there was one major difference–I was now carving out much more time for sleep, rest days, and recovery.
My WHOOP was very clear about this, after each ramp up or tough workout my body needed sleep and recovery time that I never used to give it. Now I had actionable data (often in the form of a bright red Recovery graphic) staring me in the face every morning, and I was forced to listen.
The results? I got faster. A lot faster, in less time than I ever imagined. And I did it by training less and resting more. Who would’ve thought?",1/29/18
how-whoop-drove-my-confident-comeback,How WHOOP Drove My Confident Comeback,"I ran my eighth marathon in Millinocket, ME two months ago. But that’s how the story ends.
To set the scene from the beginning, I have to rewind the clock one year to December 7, 2016, the day I had two of my parathyroid glands removed in what turned out to be a pretty significant surgery. That also coincided with the week I got my WHOOP.
The two years leading up to my surgery had been filled with athletic frustration. Every workout was a struggle and my mile times were nowhere near what they’d been prior to getting sick. Even though I knew it was the result of my body reacting to hyperparathyroid disease, it was still easy to get down on myself. Judging by my stopwatch and how challenging even the slowest of workouts was, I felt like a weakling. I questioned my inner strength and my ability to just work through the pain and run faster–I questioned my commitment to pushing myself.
As a coach, it was a brutal self-image to contend with, nevermind as an athlete. I’d never allow any of my clients to get down on themselves in this way. But, we’re always harder on ourselves than we are on others, right? I also think, as athletes, we can be unreasonable in our expectations of what our bodies can do. This can be a beautiful thing when it pushes us to new heights, but also a major hindrance when the body is in disfunction and in need of self-care and patience.
So here I was, surgery day. It was the day all of my problems were going be solved. In my mind’s eye, I’d wake up after having two little tumorous glands removed from my neck, give it a few weeks of recovery, and ‘POW!’ I’d be out there running stronger than ever, feeling renewed and rejuvenated like I’d never been sick.

how-whoop-tracks-skin-temperature,New WHOOP 4.0 Metric: Skin Temperature,"While no external health monitor can track internal body temperature, the skin temperature sensor on the new WHOOP 4.0 tracks your daily skin temperature to give you another layer of knowledge about how ready your body is to perform each day. Skin temperature is one of the new metrics that WHOOP 4.0 monitors daily to provide you with information about your overall wellness.
## How WHOOP Monitors Skin Temperature
The WHOOP 4.0 uses a sensor that sits directly above your skin to measure skin temperature. WHOOP builds a personalized baseline for your skin temperature using data from your sleep across the previous 90 nights. Daily variations are shown in the new Health Monitor (more on that to follow) where you can see how skin temperature correlates with other metrics such as live heart rate, blood oxygen levels, heart rate variability, resting heart rate, and respiratory rate.
WHOOP will notify you if your skin temperature deviates too far from your typical range. If you have a fever, you can now include that information in the WHOOP Journal so the algorithm can learn more about your personal skin temperature when you are feeling ill.

how-whoop-tracks-skin-temperature,New WHOOP 4.0 Metric: Skin Temperature,"What Can Skin Temperature Tell You?
Skin temperature can tell you about how strain and sleep are affecting your recovery. During the evening your core temperature decreases and gives off excess heat through the skin in order to cool for sleep. If your sleep is too hot, your skin temperature may reflect it. This information can help you be more comfortable while you sleep, such as using fewer blankets or an additional fan. Skin temperature can also tell you about microclimates, such as a warm room, heat exposure or if you’re fighting an illness.
## Skin Temperature vs Core Temperature
WHOOP 4.0 monitors your skin temperature while you’re sleeping.
Your skin has a major role in regulating body heat, also called thermoregulation. For example, during a vigorous workout your body temperature rises. Your sympathetic nervous system senses that rise and causes your skin to sweat, while dilating the capillaries nearest the skin to allow more blood to flow near the skin surface.
Sweat evaporates, cooling the skin, which in turn lets the blood within the capillaries cool. That cooled blood then goes back into the core where it absorbs more heat, cooling the body as it does so. These actions combine to help your body lose heat quickly.
Conversely, when body temperature drops, the sympathetic nervous system pulls blood into the body’s core and restricts blood flow near the skin to maintain warmth, causing you to shiver.
Skin temperature is typically a few degrees lower than core or body temperature, particularly on the wrist or arm where you may normally wear your WHOOP. Skin is exposed to the environment and subject to wind, weather, heating and air-conditioning, and may increase or decrease throughout the day while your core temperature remains normal (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit or 37 Celsius.)",9/15/21

## Who Tracks Using Marijuana & How Often?
Our analysis looked at the anonymous data WHOOP members who report using marijuana on a regular basis (at least 10 journal entries in the past 90 days).
On average, 10.8% of male WHOOP members log marijuana use, and 9% of female members. Those between the ages of 30 and 39 are most likely to track it (11.7%), with 12.7% of males in that age group doing so.
Male WHOOP members are more likely to log marijuana use than females, and it is most common among the 30-39 age bracket.
Of our members who do track marijuana use, they are 43% likely to answer “yes” in the journal on any given day (45% for men, 38% for women). The age group who does it most regularly is 20-29 year olds at 43.8%, and from there the frequency decreases with age.
## When is Marijuana Used Most?
April is the most popular month for marijuana use, with WHOOP members who track it logging it on 45% of all days. On the other hand, March is the least popular month at just under 42%.
Saturday is by far the most common day of the week, with the average “yes” response being 47.6%. Monday is the day with the lowest percentage of “yes” responses, slightly below 40%.

Although WHOOP members sleep slightly more on average when they log using marijuana (0.4 minutes per night), we found the quality of their sleep decreases by a small amount.
The average percentage of time spent in light sleep rises from 54% to 55%, which means the percentage of time in restorative sleep (REM and slow wave sleep) falls from 46% to 45%. Sleep efficiency and sleep consistency each drop by 1 percentage point as well.
We found marijuana use to have a very slight negative impact on sleep, resting heart rate & HRV, but no meaningful affect on RECOVERY.
Overall, we saw no significant impact to WHOOP members’ next-day recovery after logging marijuana use. However, we did find minor negative changes to both resting heart rate (RHR) and heart rate variability (HRV). On average, RHR increases by 1 beat per minute, while HRV dips by 2.8 milliseconds.

The trees on left and top of the graph represent the clustering of all 250 features. The closer two features are, the closer they cluster together and are put into the same subtree. Each subtree represents features calculated from time domain, frequency domain, accelerometer and physiological values.
The above figure displays the complexity and diversity of the features used at any time for heart rate estimation. This is illustrated by the fact that no two features are completely similar or correlated. Additionally, the fact that all the rows and columns are unique shows the tremendous variety of complex scenarios and conditions in our analysis. By using the information encoded in all of these features, we can help eliminate the occasional outliers in reported heart rate data.

### Data-Driven Machine Learning in Heart Rate Calculation
The latest version of the WHOOP heart rate calculation algorithm now incorporates data-driven machine learning to improve its accuracy. In order to train your WHOOP, we used an enormous dataset consisting of thousands of hours of recording spanning various workouts from diverse subjects. And this is just a start–the more data that is collected with WHOOP, the smarter your WHOOP will become.
By employing a data-driven method, each heart rate estimator is now optimized for the best performance use in certain conditions: Sleep, low-intensity activity, regular activity like running, high-intensity activity like CrossFit, etc. Every second, the WHOOP machine-learning engine evaluates more than 250 parameters (movement, acceleration, skin conductance, ambient light, etc.) to determine your most likely heart rate.",10/10/17
improving-heart-rate-accuracy-whoop-getting-smarter,Improving Heart Rate Accuracy: Your WHOOP is Getting Smarter!,"Here at WHOOP, we are constantly working towards bettering our ability to optimize athlete performance. Part of that is a commitment to deliver the best heart rate accuracy under any condition–whether it be sleeping, walking, running, swimming, cycling, lifting weights, playing NFL football, or any of the other numerous activities that make up the daily lives of our athletes. To keep up with this challenge, our patented heart rate calculation algorithm is continuously evolving.
The goal is to diminish the impact of movement and other noise on the heart rate signal. In general, it is much more difficult to calculate heart rate via photoplethysmography (the technology behind the green lights on the bottom of your Strap) when the body is moving than when it is at rest. Our algorithm processes the massive amount of data we collect from our sensors, effectively removing the noise from the signal. This forms the foundation for the Strain, Sleep and Recovery analysis that WHOOP provides.
The WHOOP heart-rate algorithm uses advanced techniques from digital signal processing and statistical inference. There is a lot of data to make sense of and many different ways the noise can corrupt the signal. To get around this, we use multiple concurrent estimators, where each optimizes the likelihood of heart rate accuracy for a given context. We are then able to pick and choose the estimates that maximize the likelihood of accurately determining your heart rate at any given time.
Basically, WHOOP is constantly estimating your heart rate in a variety a different ways. This allows for it to be accurate under all conditions, ranging from sleep to high-intensity workouts. The graph presented below, known as a spectrogram, gives an inside look into how our sensors “see” the heart rate data. The example specifically shows how WHOOP can keep up with interval training through phases of high-intensity and low-intensity activity.",10/10/17

I quickly learned about the things that affect your Recovery, like going to bed at a certain time, using your phone before you go to sleep, what and when you eat, not having a beer after a game, etc. I got to actually see what all of these things do to your body instead of just hearing ‘There’s science, there’s science, a study proved this, a study proved that…’ Now I had the information first hand.
I also realized that the days I put a ton of trauma [Strain] on my body were the days that I pitched. I’d probably throw 150-170 baseballs those days, between warming up in the bullpen and before innings, and pitching in the game. I used to wonder why I’d get terrible sleep the night after I pitched. So I started making adjustments, drinking more water those nights, no phone, no beer, getting to bed earlier–that was the biggest thing for me. I saw the effects of my better judgements in my WHOOP data. I fell in love with it real fast and I still wear it everyday.”
The adjustments Ian made included greatly reducing his cumulative Strain from things outside of baseball on the days he took the mound. Take a look at this two-week sample of his Strain (blue) and Recovery (green and yellow) data from last summer:
His two lowest-Strain days during this period were July 9 and July 16, also the two days he pitched. Ian posted great Recoveries on those days as well, including a 94% on July 16 when he surrendered just two earned runs and struck out seven batters in seven innings while earning a victory.

What’s your goal for the season ahead?
“I want to complete my dream, which means getting to the big leagues. And I don’t want to just get there, I want to stay there and succeed at that level. I set goals for myself every single day, that’s how you have to go about it. You can’t just say ‘I’m going to be a big leaguer this year,’ you have to actually do the things it takes to get there on a daily basis, like sleeping well, eating well, everything you can to maximize your performance.”",3/30/18

When I see a low Recovery I realize I have to take it easy, my body isn’t ready to pitch eight innings or throw 100 pitches. I know to ease up on those days so I don’t tweak or strain a muscle, or maybe even something worse. You want your body to always be in the best position possible. If you’re in the green, you can let it eat, you can go all out. It all leads back to the main component that you have to learn your body.”
Do you wish you’d had it when you were younger?
“I think [getting WHOOP] would’ve been the best thing I could’ve ever done, it would’ve changed the game for me in high school. For one thing, at that age you don’t realize the effects of the food you put in your body. I was a pasta and butter guy, I ate it every night just because I enjoy spaghetti. That obviously wasn’t the best thing for me. At the time, I really didn’t have a good understanding of how what goes into your body affects how you play the next day. And for the purposes of getting the highest quality sleep every night, it would’ve absolutely 100% changed the game for me.”
You played a role in the partnership between WHOOP and the NFLPA?
“I’m from San Diego, and a while back I did a charity event there with Darrell Stuckey of the Chargers. He quickly became one of my best friends. We’re always trying to give each other the edge to get better at our respective professions. I was at his house one day during the 2016-17 offseason and started talking to him about what WHOOP does for me. He said ‘Yeah, but my Fitbit does that.’ I said ‘No, no, it’s not even close.’ I told him with WHOOP, you get to see the quality of your sleep, not just how long you sleep.

“I went to the draft in New Jersey, I was projected to go anywhere from No. 10 overall to No. 20. I panicked a little bit when I started falling–I was sitting in the draft room during the TV broadcast and I couldn’t even get on a phone, so I was texting back and forth with my agent. It was a pretty stressful day to see my name drop a little bit further down than expected. I didn’t know when it was going to stop. The second I got picked was a big sigh of relief.
It was amazing though, it almost didn’t seem real, I just felt numb. In the moment, I didn’t really comprehend it, it all happened so fast. But in the next few days, it started to set in, ‘Oh my gosh, I just got drafted by the Yankees.’ I was kind of starstruck.”
When did you discover WHOOP?
“In 2016 when I was with the Yankees, there was a day where my trainer had a team meeting to talk about a new product called WHOOP. People were asking a ton of questions and I was really into it. I’ve always been an athlete who’s very curious about how my body works. In the past, I’ve fought injuries that I felt maybe could’ve been preventable by changing what I ate or how I slept. I wanted to get a handle on how to do things that are good for me specifically, not just the generalized process of what’s good and what’s bad.”

I’ve been on a bus that’s broken down and I’ve been on a bus with no AC driving through North Carolina in the middle of summer. Sometimes the bus trips are easy, other times they are extremely bad. When the games are over, no matter how long they last, you leave afterwards and get on the bus. It could be anywhere from 10 pm to 1 am and you might have a six or seven hour drive ahead of you.
That makes it really, really tough to sleep, and the quality is often terrible. I remember one ride to Lexington, KY, where we were stuck in traffic and got in at about 5 am for a 1 pm game that day. We had to try to sleep a couple hours, then wake up, get some breakfast and start the day.”
Is poor sleep a common issue players deal with?
“Absolutely, sleep is vital. You’ve got a game pretty much every single day, you get maybe two off days a month. I’ve learned playing in the minor leagues how important sleep is and that the earlier you can go to bed the better your rest is going to be. For example, you might be up till 2 am and sleep till 11 am and get nine hours of sleep, but that’s not the best nine hours of sleep you can get. From 9 am till 11 am you’re probably just trying to stay in bed and stay asleep [Editor’s note: Check out this story on The Locker about the benefits of sleep regularity].

increase-deep-sleep,How to Increase Deep Sleep with WHOOP Data Insights,"How to ImprovE Deep Sleep
Any efforts you can make to improve your overall sleep behavior will tend to benefit your deep sleep. The most basic thing to do is simply spend more time in bed. Here are 45 tips for a good night’s sleep, as well as some suggestions from the National Sleep Foundation.
In general, deep sleep usually consists of 15-25% of most adults’ total time asleep. So to reiterate the point above, when our members log in the WHOOP Journal that they sleep in their own bed (as opposed to somewhere else), on average they get 15 additional minutes of total sleep, with 3 minutes of that (20%) being deep sleep (labeled SWS in the chart below)–a proportional increase in deep sleep along the lines of what should be expected.

increase-deep-sleep,How to Increase Deep Sleep with WHOOP Data Insights,"Deep sleep, also referred to as slow wave sleep (SWS), is one of 4 stages of sleep (light, deep, REM and wake) that you spend time in each night. It is known as the “physically restorative” stage of sleep, and is of great importance for athletes and anyone looking to perform at their best on a daily basis.
## Why is Deep Sleep Important?
As stated above, deep sleep is when your body restores itself physically. The vast majority of human growth hormone (95%) is actually produced at this time. Something many people don’t realize is that you don’t actually get stronger at the gym or when you’re exercising. Your muscles break down while you’re working out, then they are built back up again during deep sleep. Getting enough deep sleep is essential for maximizing potential gains from your training that day.
Additionally, the deep sleep stage helps strengthen your immune system, regenerate cells to repair bone and tissue, stimulate blood flow to muscles, and balance your metabolism and blood sugar levels. Your heart rate and brain waves slow down at this time and it is when your body is in its most restful state.

Getting all the sleep your body needs is a great start, but equally as important is making an effort to go to sleep and wake up at regular times each day. Sleep consistency will boost your HRV by helping to sustain your circadian rhythm, and also enables you to spend more time in REM and deep sleep.
### 6. Natural Light Exposure.
6. Natural Light Exposure.
Going outside in the sunlight after waking up in the morning and watching the sky change from light to dark in the evening trigger biological processes involved with regulating sleep/wake times (see sleep consistency above), energy levels and hormone production. This will also improve alertness, mood and vitamin D production.
### 7. Cold Thermogenesis.
7. Cold Thermogenesis.
Exposing your body to cold temperatures for brief periods of time (cold showers, ice baths, etc.) will stimulate the vagus nerve, which activates the parasympathetic branch of your autonomic nervous system and controls heart rate variability.

Here’s a more detailed explanation of intelligent HRV training.
### 2. Good Nutrition at the Right Times.
2. Good Nutrition at the Right Times.
It’s no surprise that a smart and healthy diet will benefit your HRV, but something many of us may not realize is that the timing of your food intake can affect it as well. Your body functions better when it knows what’s coming and regular eating patterns help maintain your circadian rhythm. Additionally, not eating close to bedtime (within 3-4 hours) will improve the quality of your sleep by allowing your body to focus on other restorative processes instead of digestion.
### 3. Hydrate.
3. Hydrate.
Your level of hydration determines the volume of your blood, and the more liquid you have in your system the easier it is for blood to circulate and deliver oxygen and nutrients to your body. Drinking close to an ounce of water per each pound that you weigh is a good daily goal. On average, when WHOOP members log that they are sufficiently hydrated their HRV increases by 3 milliseconds.
### 4. Don’t Drink Alcohol.
4. Don’t Drink Alcohol.
We’ve found that when WHOOP members report consuming alcohol, their HRV drops by an average of 22 milliseconds the next day.

We’ll discuss the value of REM sleep and how much is normal, then share a number of things you can do to improve it.
## Why REM Sleep is Important
REM sleep is essential for keeping your brain and body healthy, and a sufficient amount is required in order to perform at your best. It also plays an important role in mood regulation as well. Additionally, research suggests when people are deprived of REM sleep they are less capable of remembering things they’ve learned prior to falling asleep.

In a program the team believes is the first of its kind in the sports industry, the Dodgers are soliciting ideas and furnishing the support that could bring them to fruition.”
Franchises from three of the four major American pro sports leagues have created (or announced plans to) versions of innovation labs in the last 18 months. Will this soon become the norm across the NBA, NFL, MLB, and the NHL as well?
Dodgers Chief Financial Officer Tucker Kain thinks so, and he’s pleased to see other teams following in his club’s footsteps. Kain recently told GeekWire that he eventually expects this sort of thing to “be a real portion of what it means to operate and own a sports team. … The accelerator model is one that can position an organization to be open to change and innovation. I like seeing other organizations do this, because one of us is going to help incubate and accelerate something that will change the face of our industry and benefit everybody.”

introducing-strength-trainer-a-new-way-to-quantify-the-impact-of-your-strength-training,Introducing Strength Trainer: A New Way to Quantify The Impact of Your Strength Training,"How Muscular Load Influences Strain
When you use Strength Trainer, your Activity Strain will measure both cardiovascular load and muscular load. If you strength train regularly, you’ll likely notice higher Strain scores. Your Day Strain will also be higher on the days Strength Trainer is used to track weight lifting workouts, likely causing your Sleep need to be higher. These insights can help you make better decisions when it comes to planning your recovery and your next workout.
## How to use Strength Trainer
## What To Expect Next
With the launch of Strength Trainer, WHOOP is the first wearable that comprehensively measures both cardiovascular and muscular load. Whether it’s through a regular functional fitness routine or a strength training workout, members will get more credit for the work they do. This is the first step for WHOOP in the strength training space and we look forward to continuing to refine the feature.
The content available through the WHOOP services may include training information or routines, and other media to help you meet your health, fitness, and wellness goals. WHOOP is not a healthcare provider, personal trainer or fitness instructor and these services (including any recommendations and any information available through these services that may appear to be personalized) may not be appropriate for you. WHOOP is not responsible for any results that may or may not be obtained from the use of these services.",4/25/23
introducing-strength-trainer-a-new-way-to-quantify-the-impact-of-your-strength-training,Introducing Strength Trainer: A New Way to Quantify The Impact of Your Strength Training,"## Quantify Your Strength Training
Most wearables only track your cardiovascular load during exercise using your heart rate, which is great for exercises like running, cycling, and other aerobic activities. However, if you do a very intense or heavy weight training session like powerlifting, your heart rate response isn’t proportional to the effort you give and the load your body sustains. No wearable has effectively quantified the impact of strength training on your body – until now.
Strength Trainer fills a critical gap in the wearables space by quantifying both cardiovascular and muscular load for a comprehensive view of your training, allowing you to train more effectively and efficiently.
## Calculating Muscular Load
For activities like strength training, measuring cardiovascular load alone doesn’t account for how hard your body is working. WHOOP has developed an algorithm to calculate muscular load – the amount of stress put on muscles, bones, joints, and tissues. Strength Trainer uses biomechanics to track the impact various strength training exercises have on your body. Different movements have different movement profiles and use a different percentage of the total musculoskeletal system. For instance, a back squat has a different load profile than a calf raise because it uses more muscles and joints, creating higher muscular load.
Strength Trainer considers all of the movement profiles that are part of your workout session and quantifies your muscular load using the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors in WHOOP to understand the volume and intensity of your workout. It calculates the volume for each repetition of each exercise, measures the intensity for each repetition, and estimates the max volume based on your workout history to generate a unique muscular load for every strength training session.",4/25/23
introducing-stress-monitor-a-new-way-to-monitor-manage-stress,Introducing Stress Monitor: A New Way to Monitor & Manage Stress,"Stress is the body’s natural response to a physical or mental challenge. It can speed up the aging process, cause inflammation, and impact vital recovery processes. It’s more commonly known that stress can have these negative impacts on the body and brain, but healthy levels of stress can actually help improve your focus, memory, and overall performance.
The truth is, you want to have just the right amount.
## Measuring Stress
Stress Monitor is able to give you a real-time stress score between 0 and 3 by measuring your heart rate and HRV and comparing that to your baseline. WHOOP also limits the impact exercise can have on your stress score by taking your motion into account, so you can understand whether you’re actually stressed or just exerting yourself physically.
To develop an algorithm for measuring stress, WHOOP recruited participants into WHOOP Labs, a full-time research facility, to look at activities recorded by WHOOP members. The impact of stressful and relaxing activities on heart rate and heart rate variability were examined, as were the impacts of light physical activity, cold exposure, breathing, and cognitive challenges on heart rate and heart rate variability. Those deviations were compared to deviations in blood pressure. The research showed that changes in heart rate correlated with changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, classic markers of stress.
Aside from measuring stress in real time, Stress Monitor also features a 12-hour stress graph where you can see how your stress ebbs and flows throughout the day, helping you spot patterns in your stress level.

Stress Monitor utilizes cyclic sighing (physiological sigh) and cyclic hyperventilation in two different customizable sessions.
The increase relaxation session utilizes the cyclic sighing (physiological sigh) exercise to help you regulate a stressful physical or emotional response, or wind down.
The increase alertness session utilizes the cyclic hyperventilation exercise to dial up your responsiveness to external stimuli and help you stay energized.
After a breathwork session is completed it autosaves as a breathwork activity, you can then tap into your saved activity to see insights like how the session changed your stress score, and the varied rates in your inhales, exhales, and breath holds.
## Using Stress Monitor
Stress Monitor tracks trends in your resting heart rate and your HRV to measure its effects. Over time, this feature is meant to help members understand how the body and mind are connected, and identify which situations trigger a physiological response. Stress Monitor will continue to evolve based on feedback and support from members as they unlock their stress.

introducing-the-new-tyrxwhoop-smart-swimsuit,Introducing the New TYRxWHOOP Smart Swimsuit,"As a swimmer, what are the benefits of smart swimsuits like TYRxWHOOP?
Corey Berger: This is the starting point for getting better data to athletes and swimmers at all levels to help them understand and improve key performance and recovery factors.
Rachel Ripley: Swimmers tend to push themselves to the limit of their physical capacity, and that’s often what’s asked of them on a daily basis. Having WHOOP in the suit will help them understand how to help their bodies hit peak performance, and when they may need for recovery day.
Any time you can get something off of your body to make it less restrictive, it’s definitely helpful. Swimmers anchor down in the water with their pull and being able to put a wearable in a suit that you don’t even notice is there means nothing interferes with your swimming.
### What was the development process like?
Rachel Ripley: We took our top selling, tried-and-true suits, the DiamondFit and the Jammer, and decided to try to find a way to incorporate WHOOP. We worked with a wide array of athletes, ranging from Masters swimmers to college athletes, to determine the best place for WHOOP to go. Initially, we had two pod placements, but after WHOOP tested the data and algorithms, we found one optimal location in each suit. We also ensured that WHOOP could withstand the conditions of the pool, including repeated exposure to chlorine.
### What does this mean for the future of technology and wearables in swimming?
Rachel Ripley: Since FINA, the Federation Internationale de Natation, the world governing body for aquatic sports, recently changed their rules and will allow technical devices or smart devices in competition, I have no doubt we’re on the cusp of a lot of innovation in the industry. This is the first time there’s an opportunity to connect technology with the athlete while they’re competing at the highest level, which is exciting.

While the blue light glasses on the market today provide great benefits, depending on the brand, style, and testing process, the benefits can vary. We decided to bring our research-first approach to developing the highest-quality blue light blocking glasses proven to promote better sleep.
The leading WHOOP designers, engineers, and researchers came together to develop multiple prototypes in a variety of eyewear shapes, materials, and more to find the perfect pair that balances function and fashion. Engineered of highly durable stainless steel and titanium, WHOOP Blue Light Glasses are designed for durability and for performance wear. To optimize blue light viewing during the day and at night, we developed two distinct options: a line of clear lenses that block 30% of blue light emissions and a second line with amber lenses that block 59% of blue light emissions.
The ultimate test of our WHOOP Blue Light Glasses was evaluating their impact on sleep and recovery metrics. In partnership with WHOOP Labs, we conducted a study and saw the following benefits on nights when participants wore WHOOP Blue Light Glasses:
Our research also found that the clear lenses provided more utility during daytime wear for moderate amounts of blue light while the amber lenses had a greater positive impact when worn in the hours prior to going to sleep.

That’s why we’re excited to introduce WHOOP Blue Light Glasses which have been tested and proven to help wearers get more sleep and better recoveries.
## WHAT IS Circadian Rhythm?
Circadian rhythm is the natural way your body follows its 24-hour internal clock physically, mentally, and behaviorally. Your circadian rhythm maintains your sleep/wake cycle and plays an integral role in the quality of your sleep and how you feel.
As it gets darker in the evening, your brain tells your body to make more melatonin so you feel tired and prepare for bed because your circadian rhythm responds to light and dark to guide the mental and physical processes in your body.
## What is Blue Light?
The circadian clock is heavily influenced by the light/dark cycle of the sun. The sun emits a number of wavelengths of lights – shorter wavelengths possess higher energy and blue light is the shortest visible light, just slightly longer and less powerful than UV rays.
Some amounts of blue light during the day can make you feel more energized and alert while helping to regulate your circadian clock. However, excess light at night – especially blue light which our eyes can’t effectively filter – has been shown to disrupt your body’s biological clock and suppress melatonin.",11/3/22

In addition to providing several scholarships, WHOOP will also give its industry-leading wearable technology and accompanying memberships to all 242 participating JRF scholars so they may optimize their health and wellness goals.
Founded in 1973 by Rachel Robinson, wife of Jackie Robinson, the JRF works to advance higher education for underrepresented students by providing four-year scholarships and a comprehensive set of support services to highly motivated students attending colleges and universities throughout the country. As a result, JRF scholars hold a consistent 98% graduation rate, which is more than twice the national average for African American college students.
By supporting three scholars over the course of their four-year undergraduate experiences starting in fall 2021, WHOOP is committing to helping these students pursue their passions and carry on the legacy of Jackie Robinson through his foundation and its 1,700 alumni. This partnership also underscores the commitment that WHOOP has to diversity, equity and inclusion and the alignment of both organizations to drive positive change at the intersection of sports, business, science and education.
“Jackie Robinson was a pioneer in sports and a national symbol of courage and values-driven leadership,” said Will Ahmed, WHOOP Founder and CEO. “The Jackie Robinson Foundation has carried on his important legacy and emerged as one of the most successful charities for advancing equal opportunity amongst young, underprivileged students. We look forward to supporting JRF and its scholars for years to come.”",6/21/21
jackie-robinson-foundation-partnership-scholarships,WHOOP and Jackie Robinson Foundation Announce Partnership and Grant for Student Scholarships,"For WHOOP, supporting people in their pursuit of knowledge, improvement and excellence is a kindred mission. College sports teams across the country, including athletic departments at schools like Howard University and the University of Tennessee, leverage WHOOP to improve student-athlete performance. Optimal sleep and health are key factors in achieving academic success and studies show that people who wear WHOOP experience longer and more consistent sleep as well as improved physiology. WHOOP is the only product of its kind approved for in-game use by Major League Baseball and it is currently used by more than a dozen teams to improve player performance.
“For 48 years, JRF has worked to level the playing field in the workplace, having disbursed nearly $100 million in aid to talented, young people who have gone on to become leaders in their professions and communities,” said Della Britton, president of the Jackie Robinson Foundation. “We are so grateful to WHOOP for recognizing the importance of our mission and for such generous support. We’re excited to be working with such an innovative and dynamic company that stands for the same ideals embodied in the legacy of our namesake.”
In his lifetime, Jackie Robinson broke barriers as the first African American to play in Major League Baseball in 1947, a National League Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player while on the Brooklyn Dodgers, a Baseball Hall of Fame inductee. In addition to his significant achievements in sports, Jackie worked to close the education gap and stood up for diversity, equity and inclusion during a time of intense national division.

joe-holder-black-history-month,Black History Month: A Reminder from Joe Holder to Celebrate and Care For All,"February is Black History Month, and at a time that it seems like our culture is ever more divided there is ample opportunity to look at the contributions that minority groups have provided to the storied history of the United States and the evolution of sports around the world. One must remember that when highlighting Black America, it’s not about simply emphasizing the transgressions that may have been imposed on that race. While that matters for context and healing, it is instead apt to understand how contributions made by people whose stories haven’t been fully told have created a world that is better for us all.
People like Otis Boykins, who patented 28 inventions in his career that included a regulator that improved the pacemaker, and former U.S. Surgeon General Regina Benjamin who masterminded the National Prevention Strategy health initiative. From the major contributions African Americans have made in STEM, and of course to sports as well, WHOOP would not be able to fully flourish if it weren’t for them.
With the rise of wearables and the benefits they can have on public health, WHOOP is determined to get their device to as many people as possible in an effort to use data to further public health initiative and research. It’s important to keep in mind here that the creation of a world that is better for us all is an obligation we must accept.

It does, but we have to realize our ability to track our well-being must extend to then improving those same stats for others.
During his Birth of a New Age speech in 1956, Martin Luther King Jr. said “An individual has not started living until he can rise above the narrow confines of his individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity.” Eighty-two million people, over a quarter of the US population, have inadequate to no health insurance. Over 30 million have diabetes. Almost 170 million people in the United States are overweight or obese. The prevalence of high blood pressure in African Americans is among the highest in the world. Black men still have a lagging life expectancy. Race-based mistakes in diagnosis of medical conditions still remains an issue.

john-john-florence-surfer-training,Pro Surfer John John Florence Training for World’s Biggest Stage,"On Mindfulness and Recovery
For Florence, being one of the top surfers in the world is a result of hard work, talent, and consistency. WHOOP is a tool that provides concrete data on his performance both in and out of the water, so he can evaluate his body’s daily needs and know himself better.
“The biggest benefit of using WHOOP for me is to be able to keep an eye on how much training and how much activity I’m doing, because I tend to overdo things. And so for me to be able to see it and be able to see the recoveries is very helpful for me, because if I’m not doing that, I’ll just keep going and going and going until something breaks.”
After being on WHOOP for a few years, he’s started to understand his trends very well and knows what his body needs to get back in the green. “I have a good idea of what my recoveries will be and what I need to do to recover. I know that if I strain from 18 to 20 one day, two days in a row, then I know that I’m in need for a big recovery day.”
And for Florence, a recovery day doesn’t necessarily mean taking a nap on the beach. Through WHOOP, he’s learned that maintaining a 13 or 14 strain on his off days actually helps his recovery the following day, as opposed to doing absolutely nothing and keeping his strain low. Active recovery could include some swimming, light gym routines, or tending to his farmland. This active recovery is proven by science; studies have shown that active recovery after intense periods of exercise can help athletes return to baseline quicker rather than passive recovery.
To be a world-class athlete, it’s just as much a mental sport as it is physical. For Florence, self-awareness is key. “It definitely makes me more mindful of what I’m doing,” he says. “WHOOP will help me accomplish my goals for 2021 by helping me regulate my recovery and my training.”",11/19/20

John John and his brother Nathan started using WHOOP over 3 years ago. Since becoming a WHOOP member, Florence has experienced some of the lowest and highest points of his career. In June of 2019, he was contending for another world title at the Oi Rio Pro in Brazil when he ruptured his ACL while competing. He felt his knee buckle and immediately knew something was wrong.
For the next 5 months, Florence’s primary focus was recovery. That meant rest, rehab, and basic mobility work to maintain range of motion. While he rehabbed, he used WHOOP to gauge his body’s physiological changes and monitor his baseline. He noticed that daily metrics like resting heart rate slightly increased, while HRV (heart rate variability) slightly decreased as he took a break from surfing and redefined his fitness.
“Before I got hurt, I had to be at least at 120, 130 [HRV],” says Florence, referring to his heart rate variability necessary for a green WHOOP recovery. “But now I’ll be at 100 and I’ll have a 98% recovery. It changes as you go.”
John John Florence uses his WHOOP recovery to help guide his training.
Monitoring the changes in his body has allowed Florence to fine-tune his training and see what types of behaviors increase his recovery and help him perform better. After 5 months of rest and rehab, Florence returned to the scene in December 2019 to compete in the Billabong Pipeline Masters. Despite barely being in the water as he rehabbed, Florence achieved what he described as a dream come true: He edged out one of the all-time greats Kelly Slater.",11/19/20

In Florence’s words, surfing is very much a stop and go kind of sport, similar to sprinting. You have moments of calm on the water while you paddle and wait, and intense, decisive moments of action while you navigate the waves. This unique blend of cardio, strength, balance, and adrenaline makes surfing vastly different from your typical endurance activity like running or cycling.
“When you look at your heart rate graph, it’s very up and down, up and down, up and down,” he says.
John John Florence’s heart rate data while surfing, tracked by WHOOP.
This constant ebb and flow translates beyond the water; it’s a daily game of balance whether Florence is trying a new activity (he wants to do more endurance-based activities like cycling in 2021), changing his mindset to stay positive, or planting bananas on his farmland at his home in Oahu. Although 2020 has been a disappointing year for athletes across the world, it’s given Florence an extra year to prepare for the biggest stage of his life.
It has also provided Florence the chance to work with WHOOP on a new line of watersport accessories. After losing his Strap in the water, Florence brought this concern to the WHOOP team. The result? A new accessory designed to keep his WHOOP 100% secure: The Hydrosleeve.

journaling-benefits-sleep-hrv,Journaling Can Benefit Your Sleep and HRV,"Journaling is one of over 100 actions, choices, and behaviors you can track via the WHOOP Journal in order to gain a better understanding of how various things you do may impact your biometric data.
Writing thoughts down in a journal is a popular form of self care for mental health, but an analysis of our data shows it can have potential benefits to your physical health too.
## Tracking Journaling in the WHOOP App
About 4% of our members log journaling on a regular basis (answering “yes” or “no” to the question “Journal your thoughts?” 10 or more times over the past 90 days). Looking at anonymous aggregated data, we found that 20-29 year olds are the ones most likely to do it (4.7%), and the percentage decreases slightly with age.

Looking at anonymous aggregated data, we found that 20-29 year olds are the ones most likely to do it (4.7%), and the percentage decreases slightly with age.
It is also more common for females (6.6%) to track journaling than males (3.3%).
Of our members who do consistently report journaling, they tend to do it about once every 4-5 days (22.8% of all days on average).
Monday is the most popular day of the week for journaling (a “yes” response 29% of the time), then it declines as the week goes on (Saturday is the lowest at 21%). And to no surprise, January is the month of the year when it happens most frequently, in particular the first few days of the month after New Year’s resolutions are made.

journaling-benefits-sleep-hrv,Journaling Can Benefit Your Sleep and HRV,"Effects of Journaling on Sleep, Heart Rate & HRV
When our members log journaling, their average number of sleep disturbances sees a minor dip from 11.3 per night to 11.2. Additionally, their percentage of restorative REM sleep rises slightly from 24.6% to 24.9% on average (and in turn their light sleep percentage falls from 54.2% to 53.9%).
Most significantly, average sleep consistency rises from 70% to 72% on nights members report journaling. This makes sense, if journaling is part of your bedtime routine you likely have more consistent sleep patterns when you stick to it.
When WHOOP members Log journaling they see mild improvements in RHR, HRV & sleep consistency.
Beyond sleep, we found our members have modest improvements in recovery metrics as well after reporting journaling. Heart rate variability rises by an average of 1.4 milliseconds, while resting heart rate drops by 0.9 beats per minute.

justin-thomas-heart-rate-players-championship,Green Recoveries Help Fuel Justin Thomas’ Players Championship Win,"This past weekend, Justin Thomas pulled off one of the greatest comebacks ever at the Players Championship, which features arguably the PGA Tour’s most competitive field and is often referred to as golf’s unofficial 5th major. Trailing by 7 strokes with 36 holes to go, Thomas shot 12 under par over the tournament’s last two days to finish at -14 and earn a 1-stroke victory.
We break down Thomas’ strain and recovery data leading up to the final round of the tournament, as well as his heart rate during a few of its defining moments.
## Balanced Strain & Recovery
In the week prior to the Players Championship, Thomas made clear efforts to ensure his body was not enduring a greater workload than it could handle.
The graphic below shows his daily strain (cardiovascular exertion on a 0-21 scale) and recovery (how prepared your body is to take on strain, from 0-100% and categorized as red, yellow or green). By keeping his strain in line with his recovery each day, Thomas enabled himself to be well rested and primed to perform when it mattered most.
Justin Thomas’ strain (blue) and recovery (yellow/green) were in perfect balance heading into the Players Championship, with his recovery peaking as he took home the title.
You can see above that Thomas’ recovery was trending in the right direction heading into the tournament. However, what really stands out is that it didn’t peak at the start of the Players Championship, but rather towards the finish.",3/17/21

The last day of the tournament was by far the most strenuous for Thomas. His strain hit 16.4 on Sunday after being in the 13-14 range over the previous three days. Since strain is derived from a person’s elevated heart rate, it quantifies things beyond physical exertion as well–like the stress and intensity of a pressure-packed final round of golf.
Thomas’ climactic Sunday at the Players Championship was not short on heart-pumping moments. Here’s his heart rate prior to and during an eagle putt on the 11th hole that gave him the tournament lead:

On Day 1 of the tourney, Thomas’ recovery was in the yellow at 62%. He shot a 1-under-par 71. Thomas was 77% recovered (green) on Day 2, but was sitting at 1 over par through the first 9 holes. At that moment he was behind the cut line and was in serious danger of making an early exit from the tournament.
However, Thomas shot 3 under on the back 9 to end the day 2 below par after a second straight 71. He was still 7 strokes off the lead.
Saturday, Day 3, Thomas awoke with an 84% recovery, his best of the weekend. He then played his best round of the weekend as well, shooting an 8-under 64 to end the day at -10.
After waking up with an 84% WHOOP recovery, Justin Thomas shot an 8-under 64 on the Saturday of his Players Championship win.
On Sunday Thomas’ recovery was green for the third day in a row, 77%. Part of what allowed his body to maintain such favorable recovery despite high levels of strain was exceptionally good-quality sleep. Thomas got 3+ hours of restorative REM sleep each night of the tournament (people generally spend roughly 20-25% of their time asleep in REM).",3/17/21

Over the past two weeks, there are a number of potential indicators in Justin and Rory’s data that they may each be primed and ready to go on Friday.
In the past 10 days, Justin has recorded his best recovery of the year (99%), as well as his longest sleep (9.3 hours) and time spent in bed (10.8 hours). Similarly, over that same span Rory has also logged his lowest RHR (46) and most efficient sleep (96%) of the season.

How has Katrin been able to maintain this level of excellence for so long?
According to her, sustained success lies in the details. “All the little things that you think are so little add up to great things,” Katrin told us on the WHOOP Podcast. That, and a good night’s sleep. “My No. 1 recovery [tool] is always sleep,” she said. In fact, she’ll often pass up other recovery modalities in favor of spending more time in bed. “I’ll skip everything, even at the Games, I’ll skip body work if I need to sleep.” She went on to say:
“Recovery is so important, I can go as hard as I want, day in and day out, but you can only go as hard as you then recover for the next day. WHOOP keeps me accountable.”
On the first day of Stage 1 of the Games last month, Katrin awoke with a 58% recovery. She placed 12th on Friendly Fran, 27th on the 1RM Front Squat, and 11th on Damn Diane (see the full explanation of each event at crossfit.com). Despite rallying to finish 4th in the 1,000-meter row, she still sat in 8th place overall (out of 30 competitors) with a lot of ground to make up in order to reach the top 5 and move on to the finals.
True to her word, Katrin focussed on sleep.
After posting a strain of 15.7 (on a scale of 0-21) on Day 1, she still managed to get all the sleep she needed that night with a 100% sleep performance. Katrin woke up the next morning with a 65% recovery, a very solid number considering the stress put on her body the day before.",10/21/20

WHOOP: What made you decide to give bobsled a try?
Kelsey Kiel: The 2020 CrossFit season was rocked by COVID. After I had secured my individual ticket to the Games, it was rescinded due to them changing how people could qualify. That came at a time in my life that things were shifting a bit, and I knew I was going to be moving away from Boston.
I actually received an Instagram message from Kaillie Humphries, one of the best bobsled pilots in the entire world (I didn’t know that at the time). She reached out to me and asked if I would ever give bobsled training a shot. Obviously, I’d trained CrossFit and I played soccer in college, but I knew nothing about bobsled. I was about to move to Vegas to continue working with my CrossFit coach when I got a phone call from Kaillie letting me know that USABS would probably have a bed for me at the Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid, NY… so I went for it.
W: You’ve been a WHOOP member for a long time, when you first started training for bobsled as opposed to CrossFit, was there anything you noticed that stood out in your data?
KK: I feel like the biggest change, and this was with my WHOOP data, with my nutrition, everything, was that I was not burning as many calories and my training volume significantly decreased. I was ‘not working as hard’ as I was when I was training CrossFit for six hours a day. It was a different kind of training. Once I got to Lake Placid it soon became clear to me that CrossFit wasn’t going to be the training that I needed to do in order to try to be good at the sport. I had to completely shift my mindset and my training.

kelsey-kiel-bobsled-heart-rate-crossfit-games,"Kelsey Kiel Talks Bobsledding, Heart Rate & CrossFit Games Team Quarterfinals","Bobsled TRaining vs. CrossFit
W: How did bobsled training differ?
KK: Bobsled is significantly more sprint-specific training. It was much less of ‘Let’s go, go, go and try to hang on and survive’ and more of like ‘Run a 45-meter sprint as fast as you can and then immediately take the time necessary to fully recover.’ Maybe you do that 6 times while resting 2-3 minutes in between each sprint, and that’s your workout.
When I first started doing all of my sprint drills, my warmup always took significantly longer than the actual training piece because I had to get my body primed and ready to sprint all out. It was always interesting to see because my WHOOP would log my warmup as the workouts. I was working so hard because it was all brand new stuff for me. I specifically nerded out on different levels of my heart rate for things within my warm-ups, and in my actual training pieces.
W: Ah, glad you mentioned heart rate. We’re very curious to hear what you’re heart rate looked like when you got in the sled for the first time.
KK: Yeah, so you’re exerting a lot of energy and then staying really still, but your heart rate is still really high. As a break woman, you’re warming up for an hour leading up to a 6-second all-out sprint. You’re sprinting and pushing as fast as you can, then you’re hopping in and sitting hunched over, bracing until you pull the brakes at the bottom. When you’re in the back of the sled you need to make sure you’re not moving much, so you hold onto the sled frame, brace your core and ‘enjoy’ the ride.
In those first couple months when I was getting used to the sport, I’m sure that my heart rate was even higher in the sled. I found myself being so out of breath at the bottom of the track because I exerted so much energy at the top and then I was holding my breath on the way down since I was so nervous. At the very end my heart rate would also be a little bit crazy, I’d be extremely out of breath and the adrenaline would be hitting hard.",4/26/22

W: After taking roughly a year off from serious CrossFit training, what has it been like getting back into competitive shape and what have you seen in your data?
KK: Something I need to personally work on in order to be a better CrossFitter is running, so I’m on a schedule where I’m running every Monday morning. Because of that my Monday day strain is always significantly higher than any other day of the week.
I’ve also been doing more steady-state aerobic work on Thursdays, trying to build up my aerobic capacity a bit. I’ll have the WHOOP Strain Target on and watch so I can keep my heart rate in the right zone. It’s cool to see the distance I’m able to run increase with my heart rate in that same zone for the same amount of time.

W: Alright, let’s talk about the CrossFit Games quarterfinals. Your team tied for 12th in the world, how do you feel about the performance?
KK: It was our first showing as a team, and I’m really proud of how we did. We had some good team wins, mentally and physically. We’re really happy with where we are at right now and definitely excited to be able to get on the competition floor with some of the teams next to us and feel that energy.
W: Do you have a highlight you’d like to share?
KK: As I mentioned, I’ve been working a lot on my running and capacity work, and burpees have always been a hard movement for me. So when I saw that there was a workout with burpees and shuttle runs, I was nervous. Honestly I was scared of it, I didn’t want to let my team down. I was thinking it would just be damage control, but we didn’t do that badly at all (38th in North America).",4/26/22
kernel-study-sleep-impulse-control,New Brain Interface Technology Uses WHOOP in Study to Monitor Connection Between Sleep & Impulse Control,"For the past several years WHOOP has helped people monitor their bodies in new and profound ways, which in turn has given insight into how their behaviors affect them. We have heard from countless members about significant behavior changes they’ve made based on our strain, recovery and sleep data.
When we started WHOOP in 2012, nobody was routinely measuring their heart rates continuously or their sleep every night, and the idea of a daily recovery metric did not exist. Since that time, we’ve seen how powerful the idea of monitoring our bodies 24/7 can be.
In many ways, the idea of tracking the activity of our brains is at a similar place as our physiological monitoring was 9 years ago. It makes sense that there would be a lot of deeply meaningful and impactful analyses and recommendations that could come from monitoring the brain.
However, it seems a daunting task–the brain is incredibly complex and machinery to monitor it has always required specialists and equipment that can weigh multiple tons. There are also no standard “numbers” for brain activity in the basic vernacular like we have for describing our strain, recovery or sleep.",2/4/21

Recently Bryan’s team ran an experiment in which they wore WHOOP and did three 60-minute sessions per week performing a variety of tasks while monitoring their brains with Kernel. The goal was to explore the relationship between sleep, cognitive function and performance.
WHOOP members will be the first to tout the power of sleep and the profound impact it can have on our overall well being. We’ve done numerous studies showing how our sleep metrics correlate with athletic and cognitive performance.
In Kernel’s exciting study, we get to see the relationship between WHOOP data and measurements of brain activity for the first time. The Kernel team shares the ambition of WHOOP and aims to make sense of the data our bodies generate to better optimize performance. Based on world-class sleep accuracy and profound behavior change found in our members, they chose to use WHOOP to measure the details of each participant’s sleep.",2/4/21

Bryan Johnson, the Founder and CEO of Kernel, is an incredibly accomplished individual. He was previously Founder and CEO of Braintree Venmo and successfully grew the payment processing company to its acquisition by PayPal. Bryan firmly believes in the power of monitoring and understanding his body to make adjustments in his lifestyle that unlock peak performance. His sleep routine, fine-tuned through in his words “thousands of self experimentations,” would fit in with even the most die-hard WHOOP members:
Dinner (last meal of the day) at 10 am to fast 10 hours before sleeping
8 pm bedtime
Blue light blocking glasses
67-degree bedroom
Meditate before bed
Deep-wave sound machine
By implementing these and other changes, Bryan has been able to increase his deep sleep by 157 percent! Despite being able to measure the impact of these behaviors, he realized he had no data about the actual activities of his brain.
Bryan started Kernel to create a consumer-friendly brain activity imaging and recording system–one that could be used with the simplicity of something like WHOOP. With the data collected, for the first time ever, Kernel will be able to unlock the secrets of the brain for all of us.
Through years of research and development, their team has built fully functional devices similar to machines you’d see in a hospital, but they are small, portable, and can be used by an individual.",2/4/21
kernel-study-sleep-impulse-control,New Brain Interface Technology Uses WHOOP in Study to Monitor Connection Between Sleep & Impulse Control,"Findings: More Deep Sleep Improves Impulse Control
Confirming our earlier studies, WHOOP data, particularly deep sleep and total sleep time, corresponded with a specific task in the study: Impulse control. Going even deeper and leveraging Kernel’s measurement of brain activity, the team found that the amount of overall sleep and deep sleep the subject got was correlated with the actual activity of the neurons in the brain!
The more sleep subjects got, the more neuronal activity was observed in the brain and the more the brain was actively engaged in the participant’s willpower control. Bryan breaks this down to the point that he can quantify an increased ability to resist eating a cookie at night when he’s gotten more deep sleep. “Kernel brain data revealed a relationship of cognitive functioning with my WHOOP data that behavior alone could not.”
This is just scratching the surface of the power of measuring your body (and brain!) and altering your behaviors to be the best version of yourself. In the future, we imagine having personalized insights about what causes our brains to activate, and how we may even be able to augment our ability to avoid that extra cookie before bed. We are excited for the future where tools like Kernel and WHOOP will give people unprecedented insight into the functioning of their brains and bodies to help them lead healthier, higher-performing lifestyles.

kirsty-godso-business-of-bodies,Kirsty Godso: In The Business of Bodies,"It’s easy to peg Kirsty as just another Instagram influencer/model/personality. With over 150,000 Instagram followers, a Women’s Health cover, and an international Clinique campaign in the books, Kirsty is undoubtedly part of a network of influential people. What many don’t understand, however, is that her following didn’t happen overnight and her journey certainly wasn’t without failures, injuries, and sacrifice. She’s far from the stock personalities you see online these days; she’s honest, makes no excuses, and doesn’t even refer to herself as a trainer. Rather, she’s in “the business of bodies,” and she recognizes her constant need for self-improvement.
“I’ve sacrificed a lot, and I don’t think people really understand that. Being a personality and sharing so much of your life, motivating people all the time–95% of the work we do is never really seen.” For Kirsty, uprooting her life from New Zealand was a huge transition with a lot of ups and downs.
“You don’t see the emotion and the illnesses and all these hardships that happen along the way. Last year I suffered more injury than I ever had in my life. I’m not bulletproof, and that was a confronting realization for me to make.”
Despite her injuries, you’ll rarely hear Kirsty ever complain. Perhaps that’s why she’s been so successful; her electric personality and endless source of energy are contagious. She makes you feel like every moment you spend with her is the most exciting part of her day. Her ability to connect with people and ignite a flame, whether she’s training them or encouraging them to work through personal struggles that may be inhibiting their progress, is undeniable.

Cold showers, Cryotherapy, and Cold Brew: “If I had the option to be in a hot pool or cold pool, I’d always choose cold. I even take cold showers during the winter. My alarm will go off at 5 am and I hop out of bed and straight to the shower.” Kirsty also regularly does Cryotherapy, and prefers her coffee cold brewed.

kirsty-godso-business-of-bodies,Kirsty Godso: In The Business of Bodies,"Born in Auckland, New Zealand, Kirsty was raised in a competitive household by parents who were professional golfers. She was always intrigued by the States; it seemed like a faraway land where all the movies were made and where all the excitement happened. Her first visit to the US was when she attended the Coachella music festival at the age of 22. Not one for partying much, she tried her first HIIT class (high-intensity interval training) while on the trip and was instantly hooked.
“I don’t care about steps. I’m not interested in calories. I want to know my ability to perform. And I know my ability to perform is based off my ability to recover.”
“I’d spent four years getting a double business degree in finance and marketing. My dream was to work with Nike, but I thought I’d work in the marketing department or something. The HIIT class was a pivotal moment in my life where I was like, this is more than just a hobby.” Her passion for high-energy, explosive fitness regimens eventually did lead her to Nike, but instead as a trainer in New Zealand, and later on a Master Trainer Australia. Later on she made the jump to NYC.
Kirsty started wearing WHOOP when she noticed best friend and fellow trainer Joe Holder religiously wearing it on his wrist. The two began comparing data and making it a competition to have better Recoveries. She describes her experience with WHOOP as a love story or a best friend–it might call you on the bad stuff, but at the end of the day it always wants what’s best for you. In her words, “you can’t lie because it’s telling you accurately what’s going on in your body.”

kirsty-godso-business-of-bodies,Kirsty Godso: In The Business of Bodies,"In a place like New York City, overtraining and burnout are almost inevitable. Giving up sleep can be seen as a badge of honor to show you’re working hard enough, and thus prove your worth. Kirsty sees the effects of burnout around her on a regular basis, and has neared the edge herself. “We’re so arrogant that we don’t think we have 10 minutes to exercise, but we’re on our phones all day? You have time. You need to enforce the discipline.”
Her honest, no-bullshit attitude is effervescent. When speaking with her, you’re forced to reflect, and you’re motivated to start taking better care of yourself. “If things aren’t working for you, just make a different choice. I always find it funny when people say ‘oh but I just love pizza!’ I’m like, maybe pizza doesn’t like you. Get over it. Just because you love something doesn’t mean it’s reciprocal.”
Similar to Joe’s methods of self-experimentation, Kirsty has found ways to optimize her life that keep her in the green. Because she’s so extroverted and her job involves constantly motivating others, she realizes that she has to find balance to avoid burnout.
Here’s how Kirsty maintains a high-energy, high-performance lifestyle:
Ketogenic Diet, Gluten-Free Diet: Kirsty was diagnosed with Celiac disease when she was younger, so following a ketogenic diet is actually quite easy for her and gives her sustained energy.

korda-sisters-golf-sleep-hrv-data,Korda Sisters’ 2021 Success & WHOOP Data Behind It,"Travel Can Takes its Toll
When Jess and Nelly joined our podcast, they discussed the significant effect travel and changing time zones can have on performance. Both sisters played in Anaheim, CA on April 1-4. However, Nelly had already competed on the west coast in Carlsbad, CA a week earlier. It’s quite possible that recent cross-country travel negatively impacted Jess’ play in Anaheim, and extra time to adjust benefited Nelly.
Jess ended that weekend tied for 36th, while Nelly was 3rd. On Day 2 of the tournament Nelly’s recovery was green at 73%, but Jess’ was just 46%. Jess also had a string of 5 straight yellow recoveries leading up to the event. She was back in the green at 86% on Saturday and played well (-4), but was already in a deep hole at +1 through the first two days.
## Elite Recovery and Quality Sleep
In April, the Korda sisters put up back-to-back 2nd-place finishes in consecutive weeks. Nelly shot -21 to tie for second in Hawaii on April 14-17. She had an outstanding third day at 9 under par, and her recovery that morning was 98%.
The following week in Los Angeles, Jess placed second at 15 under par. Her result was likely aided by multiple nights of high-quality sleep. She slept for 10:09 the night before the tourney began, with 31% of that in REM (20-25% is normal). Although she was only able to get 7:27 of sleep the next evening, she again spent 31% of it in REM.
Jess shot -7 and -6 on those first two days of the tournament.
Heading into Day 3, Jess spent 7:51 in bed and 7:33 of that asleep, good for an exemplary 96% sleep efficiency. That night she also managed to up her REM to 40% of her total sleep time:

Jess and Nelly were back-to-back champions to start the 2021 LPGA season. The first tournament on the calendar was in Orlando, FL beginning on January 21.
On Day 1, Jess had an 88% recovery and a phenomenal HRV of 210 milliseconds, well above her baseline average of 143 (HRV stands for heart rate variability, an extremely useful metric when it comes to physical fitness). Her resting heart rate was also trending downwards, another great sign, hitting a two-week low of 43 beats per minute:
Jess Korda’s resting heart was trending in the right direction in the weeks prior to winning the first LPGA event of the year.
Jess finished tied for first with a 25-under-par 260, then won in a playoff. She had a spectacular third day of play, shooting -11 on Saturday. The night before she managed to get 8:34 of sleep, a stellar amount for in the midst of a tournament.
In order to gauge their impact on her sleep and recovery, Jess often logs things like taking magnesium or getting massages in the WHOOP Journal. She spoke about this on an episode of the WHOOP Podcast:
“It’s interesting to see the results of what you put into your body. These are results that you can’t physically see, but you can see them thanks to WHOOP.”
The second LPGA event of the year was also in Florida, February 25-28 in Boca Raton. Coming off a third-place showing in Orlando, Nelly posted a 16-under 272 to capture the title. Amazingly, her recovery actually increased each day as the tournament progressed, from just 30% on Day 1, to 64% on Day 2, then to 75% and 77% on Days 3 and 4. You can see a similar trend in her HRV:

I woke up seeing high recovery scores and feeling great, which helped give me more confidence that I could play my best.”
Nelly Korda got aN excellent night’s sleep with a 94% WHOOP recovery on Day 1 of her recent tournament victory.

Her title was fueled by a spectacular second round in which she shot 9 strokes under par. The night before, Nelly slept for 9:18 and woke up with a green 80% WHOOP recovery. She was then able to sleep more than 8 hours each of the next two nights as well (with 95% sleep efficiency, meaning good sleep without the option of spending tons of time in bed) as she put up back-to-back rounds of -4 to win the championship at -19.

Last year, we discussed the immense strain of the Tour de France. Lachlan’s ride took it to another level. “It’s a very different [kind of] tired,” he said. “It takes me 2-3 hours to get going, then I have 5 hours where I feel really good, then the last 4-5 hours is really difficult again. The toll on my body is a lot more, I’ve got blisters and chafe everywhere. Each day I’ve kind of hit my limit in some way, but I haven’t had a total meltdown so that’s a highlight.”
While many of Lachlan’s highest daily strain numbers (20.7s on a 0-21 scale) were similar to his teammates competing in the race, he did not have the benefit of shorter stages or rest days.
Lachlan’s RECOVERY was 97% to begin his Alt Tour, but it dropped considerably over the first 10 days.
For example, on Day 5 when his teammates rode a brief 17-mile time trial and averaged a 16.6 strain, Lachlan biked for 231 miles and posted a 20.4 strain. He pushed his body to the max for 18 consecutive days, averaging daily strains of 20.6.
Lachlan’s strain peaked at 20.8 on the final leg of his Alt Tour. Two days later his recovery was back in the green.",7/16/21
lachlan-morton-alt-tour-de-france-harder,What’s More Strenuous Than the Tour de France?,"Shortly after the Tour de France officially began, EF Education First – NIPPO cyclist Lachlan Morton embarked along the route himself, riding solo without the support of his team. Raising money for World Bike Relief, Lachlan’s goal was to cross the finish line in Paris before the race competitors did.
## Lachlan Morton’s Alt Tour
In the early days of the Tour de France, riders navigated their way through the countryside on their own, stopping in cafes to eat and doing repairs to their bikes themselves. They also didn’t take team buses, cars or flights between stages.
This is what Lachlan Morton did. He camped under the stars, skipped the rest days and pedaled the entire distance from stage to stage. Over 18 days, Lachlan rode 3,424 miles and spent 225 hours on the bike (roughly 12 hours per day).
## Bikepacking the Tour De France
If you’re not familiar with the concept of bikepacking, check out our story on Ted King winning the Arkansas High Country Race.
While completing the Alt Tour, Lachlan noted that his time off the bike was practically as challenging as the riding itself. “The most difficult part is packing up day after day, riding 12 hours, and the short space you have in between to do a lot of things,” he said. “When I finish I’ve got to find some food, get a shower, clean my clothes, set up camp, try to get some sleep, and look at the route for the next day. That’s the challenge, it’s a lot of things to do in a short space of time when you’re not physically exerting yourself [on the bike].”
Lachlan Morton spent his Alt Tour sleeping in a bivy sack and carrying everything he needed with him on the bike.",7/16/21
lachlan-morton-alt-tour-de-france-harder,What’s More Strenuous Than the Tour de France?,"Sleep and Recovery?
“When you do a regular Grand Tour, from the second you finish a stage until the second you start the next stage, everything’s dedicated around getting you to recover physically for the next stage,” Lachlan explained. “So you get the best sleep, you get massages, you get the best food. Whereas here I ride twice as long each day, so that already cuts massively into any recovery time, and then you’ve got to sort out all those things yourself.”
Lachlan spent the majority of his Alt Tour cycling in sandals. His bike was also significantly heavier than what race riders used.
Lachlan averaged about 5-6 hours of sleep per night during his epic journey. After his 10th day of riding (and a fourth consecutive 20.7 day strain), he said:
“I’ve had probably on average two hours of sleep less than I normally would [per night during the Tour]. My WHOOP recovery score after last night was 33% because there was a bullfighting contest going on next to my campsite.”
## Incredible Finish
On the last day of his Alt Tour (following just 4 hours and 38 minutes of sleep and with a 27% recovery) Lachlan continued riding straight through the night, spending more than 20 hours on the bike to travel 358 miles. He finished in Paris at 5:30 am on Tuesday, July 13th.
Lachlan burned an absurd 12,000+ calories that day and put up a WHOOP strain of 20.8, something we very rarely see.
Lachlan completed his Alt Tour in Paris at 5:30 am after riding all night long.

landmark-study-whoop-korey-stringer-institute,Landmark Study from WHOOP and Korey Stringer Institute,"The purpose of the KSI study is exactly that: While validating WHOOP and the metrics it gives for its use in training, we are also looking forward to new discoveries that will enable new actionable insights for coaches, scientists, and athletes–this is the first time we are able to collect data on a continuous basis on how athletes are recovering outside of training.
The study itself was conducted on 40 NCAA collegiate athletes at UCONN with data collected on these athletes over an eight-month time span. In conjunction with the continuous data the WHOOP strap provides, the KSI staff also got athlete demographic data, blood-biomarkers, training and competition loads, and fitness and hydration status. The data is unique in that we will be able to explore relationships with it on a mass of athletes outside of a lab spanning their preseason, regular season, and postseason.
Currently, data collection has completed and the KSI team is exploring this massive dataset. The first findings elucidated relationships between sleep, training load, and fitness. These results were presented by the Korey Stringer Institute at the 40th Annual National Strength and Conditioning Association (NCSA) Conference in Las Vegas in July. Specifically, some highlights of the first analysis are:
By wearing WHOOP, anyone can get the same benefits that many of the best athletes across the world are receiving. Measuring key physiological metrics and understanding readiness to take on strain is the first step in ultimately optimizing your performance. This study, and others at whoop.com/validation, show what the WHOOP Strap measures and give powerful insights into how to achieve this.
The analysis of this huge and important data set is ongoing and many more discoveries are just around the corner. We will be sure to keep everyone updated via The Locker and our social media accounts, so make sure to follow us @whoop on Twitter and Instagram.

WHOOP partnered with the Korey Stringer Institute (KSI) at the University of Connecticut for this study on collegiate athletes.
A core company goal is to be a thought leader in exercise physiology and we are glad to have partnered with the phenomenal scientists at KSI for this study. KSI is on the forefront of modern thought in studying the health and safety of athletes in order to maximize performance and optimize safety. Their mission and excellence in scientific research made them the perfect partners for WHOOP.
The analysis we provide at WHOOP is based on years of physiological research. What struck us in the early days at WHOOP was the lack of data in previous studies in this field; whether from participants dropping out, or impractical data collection methods leading to low quality data on the athletes. The results often had low statistical significance or left massive parts of the data unanalyzed. Before co-founding WHOOP, I participated in research projects in astrophysics. We had a plethora of data coming from simulations or observations. Contrast that with the studies on athletes done today, and we saw a clear need for WHOOP.
With WHOOP, we are gathering the world’s largest exercise physiology data set to build out analytics and recommendations to help athletes optimize their training and achieve peak performance. However, we are also interested in new discoveries pushing the boundaries of knowledge forward in exercise and recovery science.

WHOOP kicks off the month with Leigh-Anne Sharek, 31, who completed the Olympic Marathon Trials this past Saturday in Atlanta. It was one of the most historic and fastest marathon trials of all-time due to the sheer number of women who qualified (more than double the men’s field). See how Leigh-Anne balances a full-time career with her sport, how WHOOP helps her stay on track, and why this was such a special moment for her and women in general.
A Historic Moment in Women’s Sports
This past weekend over 400 women toed the line in Atlanta for the Olympic Marathon Trials, the biggest field history has ever seen. The top 3 finishers would move on to represent the USA at the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics. The course was hilly, relentless, and a true test of mental strength, requiring the runners to complete 3 consecutive loops downtown with hairpin turns and sharp angles.
Brooklyn Track Club runner, forensic scientist, and WHOOP member Leigh-Anne Sharek, 31, finished the race in a time of 2:49:26, a blistering 6:28/mi. Her time placed her in the middle of the pack with numerous other women equally as competitive as her, while the small lead pack cruised through under 2:30 – all of whom were professionally sponsored runners. The reality is, the majority of women running the trials, like Leigh-Anne, were not professional athletes. They were doctors, educators, mothers, business owners, and more. The 2020 US Olympic Team Marathon Trials, in essence, were a symbol of female accomplishments highlighted on a national, televised stage featuring some of the most determined women in the country.

Despite her badass career and athletic achievements, Leigh-Anne doesn’t feel that she’s anything special. In her opinion, this is what women are called to do. They are called to be in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), they are called to be athletic, they are called to chase after multiple goals, and gender should not be a limiting factor.
“Every woman should know that they are capable of achieving whatever they want to do. Whether that’s a successful career, a family, a professional sport, or a passion project, they don’t have to be pigeonholed into a category. You know, there are so many possibilities and as women, we need to all support that dream. We can do whatever we want, and I think that’s amazing.”

leigh-anne-sharek-runner,Women of WHOOP: Meet Leigh-Anne Sharek,"Unlike most elite runners, Leigh-Anne did not run in high school or college. She did, however, have a competitive spirit and years of gymnastics training under her belt, which made her a tough competitor with excellent plyometric strength. When a friend challenged her to sign up for a 5k, she thought, Why not? She ended up running a decent time and beat her runner friend.
“That’s when I realized, I actually kind of enjoy this. It was an outlet, a balance between all my schoolwork and my life. And I was good at it,” she explains. From then on, she had the running itch, and in time would boast PRs of 17 minutes in the 5k and a sub-5 mile. In addition, she went on to co-found the Brooklyn Track Club with Steve Finley, a Virginia standout and Olympic Trials qualifier in the 3000m steeplechase. Together, they built one of the most prominent track clubs in the boroughs, drawing people of all talent and backgrounds.
By the time she found WHOOP years later, she had already run several marathons and qualified for the Olympic Trials with a time of 2:41:59 (average pace of 6:11/mi). WHOOP helped her with 2 things runners are notorious for – not allowing enough time for recovery, and overdoing the easy runs.
“Runners are really good at mileage, pace, distance, how far they’ve run, what their goal pace is,” says Leigh-Anne, who mirrors her disciplined, methodical tactics she uses in her job as a forensic scientist within her training. “But they’re not always good at the recovery aspect – how well they’re sleeping, how their body is recovering. And that can lead to injury and poorly executed workouts.”",3/3/20
leigh-anne-sharek-runner,Women of WHOOP: Meet Leigh-Anne Sharek,"By coupling the insights from her WHOOP strap with her GPS watch, she was able to see how her strain and recovery correlated to pace and effort. “WHOOP helped me realize that not every day is going to be a performance day. Not every day is going to be a peak day and you need to have down periods where your body is recovering and resting in order to have the best performance later in the week, or the best long run, or the best workout.”
In this lull between training cycles I’m having a hard time finding motivation to run. I’m tired, I’m lazy- or I just don’t feel like it. But these ladies make me want to get out and work hard. Some still have marathons to race – and seeing them push themselves each week is getting me back in the zone and ready to focus on what’s next. @bktcwomen @brooklyntrackclub • #mondaymotivation #getoutside #training #brooklyntrackclub #womenrunning #teammates #inspiringwomenrunners #trackandfield #track #workout #nikerunning #nikenyc #projectmoonshotnyc #otq2020 #olympictrials #xc #running #runningcommunity

It also knocked his HRV down to 39 milliseconds (it had been in the low 70s) and caused his RHR to spike from 43 bpm to 52 (see charts above for all three metrics).
Lionel took a well deserved break that day and didn’t log any activities in the WHOOP app. However, on Tuesday his day strain was back to 20.3, including a run of 17.1 and a swim of 16.1. His next triathlon was just 18 days away.

lionel-sanders-heart-rate-sleep-ironman,"Lionel Sanders’ Heart Rate, Strain, Sleep & Recovery Data from Ironman 70.3 Victory","Lionel Sanders is one of the most accomplished triathletes on the planet. In 2016, he broke the Ironman world record during a victory in Arizona with a time of 7:44:29. The following year he won the ITU Long Course World Championship and finished second at the Ironman World Championship in Kona, Hawaii.
In total, Lionel is a 4-time Ironman winner and a 27-time Ironman 70.3 champion. At 33 years old, he’s at a point in his career where things like recovery and sleep are more valuable than ever. Lionel has been able to brute force his way to countless wins and podium finishes, but now it’s more about efficiency, properly handling training capacity, and peaking when it matters most.
He’s always had a data-driven approach and trained in the ballpark of 30 hours per week. Lionel has also kept a very active race schedule over the years, so the miles and training load have really piled up.
WHOOP is proud to partner with Lionel and be the data source he’s ignored, or simply pushed through in the past. As accomplished as he is, he’s more motivated than ever before.
Training by way of brute force has made him one of the greatest, but after years of rigorous competition, Lionel Sanders now sees that training strategically with WHOOP data is how he’ll stay on top.

lionel-sanders-heart-rate-sleep-ironman,"Lionel Sanders’ Heart Rate, Strain, Sleep & Recovery Data from Ironman 70.3 Victory","Data from Ironman Texas 70.3
Last month, on Sunday, April 11, Lionel won the Ironman 70.3 Texas, finishing with a time of 3:42:01. He spent 26:36 in the water (1.2-mile swim), 2:01:44 on the bike (56 miles), and 1:10:52 running (13.1 miles).
In a video from his YouTube channel focusing on his training for the race, Lionel was asked “How important is sleep for an athlete?”
“Sleep is the most important thing,” he said. “Training and sleep are the two most important things, obviously. I don’t think people appreciate how much sleep can change you for the better.”
Below is a detailed breakdown of Lionel’s sleep for the week leading up to his victory in Texas. You can see he averaged just shy of eight hours per night in bed:
The two days preceding the race, Lionel awoke having slept for 8 hours and 59 minutes and then 8:30. In particular, he got an outstanding amount of restorative REM sleep, with 2 hours and 27 minutes of REM Thursday night followed by 2:59 Friday. He was only able to sleep for 4:52 the night before competing, but that was due to his 4:30 am wake-up time for a 6:45 am start.
Lionel kept his strain and recovery fairly balanced in the weeks leading up to the Texas 70.3. He also stayed primarily in the green, with an 11-day stretch where his recovery never dipped below 64%. The two days prior to competition it hit 95% and 93%.
His short sleep the night before dropped Lionel’s race-day recovery down to 55%, but his body was still primed for a championship performance.
Lionel’s heart rate variability (HRV) had been trending positively for the month heading into the race:
His resting heart rate (RHR) was improving as well, dropping to just 43 beats per minute on race day, it’s lowest point of the week:
During the 3 hours and 42 minutes Lionel was competing that day, he logged a WHOOP activity strain of 20.3 (on a 0-21 scale). His total day strain was 20.6, and he burned 5,052 calories.",5/1/21
magnesium-before-bed-improve-sleep,Does Magnesium Before Bed Improve Your Sleep?,"Magnesium is frequently utilized as a sleep supplement, but does it actually increase the duration or quality of your sleep? We examine how it impacts sleep and recovery data tracked by WHOOP, plus break down the basics of what magnesium is, how it works, how much to take, and possible side effects.
## What is Magnesium?
Magnesium is a very common mineral that is essential for human health. It is something that all your cells and organs need, contributing to muscle, nerve, heart, and brain function, as well as building strong bones and regulating blood pressure and immune system activity.
Many foods contain magnesium, and it is also readily available as a supplement. A popular use of magnesium supplements is to improve your sleep.
## How Can Taking Magnesium at Night Help You Sleep?
Magnesium deficiencies have often been connected to sleep disorders and poor sleep, so if you’re not getting enough of it in your diet a magnesium supplement may aid your sleep.
Additionally, magnesium can help your body relax. It works to inhibit the sympathetic (fight or flight) branch of your autonomic nervous system and promote parasympathetic (rest and digest) activity instead. Magnesium is also used as a treatment for restless leg syndrome, a condition that disrupts sleep for many people.",12/3/21
magnesium-before-bed-improve-sleep,Does Magnesium Before Bed Improve Your Sleep?,"Magnesium for Sleep vs Melatonin
Magnesium and melatonin are often part of the same conversation when it comes to sleep aids, but they are two very different things. While magnesium is a mineral that assists numerous processes in your body, melatonin is a hormone which contributes to regulating your sleep and circadian rhythm.
Generally speaking, magnesium helps your body relax and melatonin supports falling asleep faster. Many experts advise trying melatonin first before experimenting with magnesium. Some people may choose to use both simultaneously, especially to combat insomnia.

## Track How Magnesium Affects Your Sleep with WHOOP
WHOOP has a journal feature that lets you log when you take magnesium prior to sleep, as well as the dosage (and also many other choices and behaviors that can benefit or hurt your sleep). Alongside state-of-the-art sleep tracking, WHOOP uses this data to offer you actionable insights as to which behaviors improve or detract from your sleep and next-day recovery.
RELATED:",12/3/21
magnesium-before-bed-improve-sleep,Does Magnesium Before Bed Improve Your Sleep?,"Benefits of Magnesium for WHOOP Members’ Sleep & Recovery
In an effort to quantify any potential sleep benefits of magnesium, we examined the data from WHOOP members when they report taking it. We learned that many of them see clear improvements in their sleep and recovery following magnesium supplements prior to bedtime.
WHOOP members average 15 more minutes of sleep per night when they use magnesium, as well as 2% more REM sleep. They also wake up the next morning with an average recovery 8% higher.
WHOOP MEMBERS Average more sleep and higher recovery after taking magnesium.
We took possible confounding factors into account during this analysis to control for other sleep-promoting behaviors (like meditation before bed or a sound machine when sleeping) that you might also engage in while taking magnesium.
In general, we found a greater increase in average sleep time for men (+16 minutes) as opposed to women (+ 9 minutes), and also diminishing benefits around age 40. WHOOP members between 40 and 60 years old saw no improvement in average time asleep.
## Magnesium Dosage, Risks & Potential Side Effects
Recommendations for the proper dosage of magnesium to take before bed vary, and they are often slightly higher for men than women. For the most part, something in the range of 200-350 milligrams is the suggested amount.
Taking too much magnesium can cause the following:
Cramping
Nausea
Diarrhea (with magnesium oxide in particular)
Irregular heartbeat (from very high intakes)
Magnesium supplements may also interfere with certain medications. Additionally, putting more magnesium into your body than it needs can lead to magnesium toxicity, with possible symptoms including low blood pressure, muscle weakness, and vomiting.",12/3/21

April 20th, 2020 would have been the 124th anniversary of the Boston Marathon, and it would have been Jessie’s 5th year running the race. Instead, it’s been postponed to September 14th, and rightly so. While running in groups right now is discouraged and unsafe, running alone has not been cancelled, which is why Jessie is running a marathon by herself.
Her route has been mapped out, starting in Brooklyn and ending at Rockaway Beach. She’ll be wearing her WHOOP the entire time: Her first time running a marathon with WHOOP data by her side. Unlike other running watches that focus on GPS monitoring and pace, WHOOP has given Jessie 24/7 insight into her daily cardiovascular output, recovery, and sleep tracking. One major benefit of staying home? Getting more sleep to improve her training.
“Sleep has been my achilles heel over the years, and I know that I absolutely must prioritize it for performance and overall health. It’s been clear since the pandemic that as my sleep has gone up, so has HRV and also recovery and ability to take on strain.” For WHOOP members like Jessie, this has been a completely new routine resulting in new learnings from her data.
“I am doing it for me, because it brings me joy and peace of mind to run long. But I am also doing it for my friends and my fellow athletes. I know that often others need to see people challenge themselves and do things that maybe seem crazy because it opens up possibilities. It’s hopeful.”

Adidas Performance Coach, art therapist, and WHOOP member Jessie Zapotechne finds strength in her New York City running community amidst a global pandemic. While she cannot host in-person group runs or race locally with her Adidas Runners and Girls Run NYC teammates, she has found new ways to empower the local running scene and has committed to running 26.2 solo miles the original day she planned to run the 2020 Boston Marathon. Photos provided by Lauren McNary and Keith Montero.
It’s week 7 of quarantine in New York City. Since the onset of the pandemic, NYC has been hit the hardest in terms of COVID-19 diagnoses and related deaths. There’s no easy way around it – it’s grim, and it’s managed to put the city that never sleeps on an indefinite hold. And yet, at the very same time we’ve seen a new creative renaissance emerging – from closeted artists painting masterpieces in their living room apartment, to everyday people making viral videos as they find ways to connect remotely.
For runner, coach, and art therapist Jessie Zapotechne living in Brooklyn, quarantine has been surprisingly productive in the most unanticipated ways. While the city is on pause, Jessie has used this time to her advantage by corralling her immediate networks to maintain a sense of community, encourage staying active, and simply check in. In addition, she’s clocked some of her highest mileage running alone on the quiet streets of Brooklyn, bandana wrapped around her face, 6 ft. away from those on the bike paths. Typically she runs late morning or mid-day when most people are working from home on their laptops.",4/20/20

I am running a lot for my mental well-being, and now more than ever I really need it,” says Jessie, who discovered WHOOP from a colleague several months ago. She was hooked to the concept immediately, and thought it could be a new tool the urban running scene could benefit from. “She was wearing it and said–’this is the next big thing.’”
During this time Jessie has used WHOOP to see how her body is adapting to her increased mileage and new recovery routines. Now that she’s able to get more sleep and spend time on recovery protocol (rolling, stretching, meditation), the data has been fascinating. “WHOOP has helped me to begin to bring awareness to some of my behavioral patterns and choices that ultimately have a huge effect on how I am performing. Not just as an athlete, but as a human each day.”",4/20/20
marathon-runner-jessie-zapotechne,"When All Else Fails, Running Still Prevails","Running Together in New York City…Digitally
New York is a surprising mecca for running. “It is literally the most interesting place and continues to be the most stimulating place that I have ever run,” says Jessie, who has been a leading figurehead in the urban running scene for years. Dubbed “the first lady of running” by her peers, Jessie helped grow a swell of runners in Brooklyn and Manhattan by being an original member of the Bridgerunners, co-founding the Black Roses, and eventually starting Girls Run NYC in 2015. These groups are known for being a collective of creative, progressive individuals who also happen to love running. Today, Jessie is the co-captain of Adidas Runners NYC and co-leads Girls Run NYC.
“With both groups, a strong sense of community is part of the foundation–and so without the ability to meet in person on a weekly basis it has been important to keep athletes connected and engaged,” she explains. Just because gatherings are cancelled, doesn’t mean runners can’t motivate and challenge each other.
Specifically, Jessie has stayed connected with her Girls Run community via WhatsApp and Zoom. Girls Run NYC, founded in 2015, features women of all backgrounds and athletic experience who meet weekly at McCarren park for a workout. It’s a simple, safe, judgment-free zone for female runners of all abilities to exercise and connect. Keeping in touch each week has helped foster a sense of security and comfort for the core group of women missing that social connection.
Similarly, Jessie and the other captains of Adidas Runners NYC have shifted gears to create weekly digital programming for thousands of people. Rather than focusing solely on running, Adidas has operated from a holistic approach to training in areas of movement, nutrition, mindset, recovery, and gear. These five pillars have been encouraged via daily content shared in Facebook groups, Instagram Live sessions (like meditation or at-home workouts), virtual runs, and weekly check-ins.",4/20/20

In the endurance community, it’s when you’ll hear things like, “The hay is in the barn,” and “The hard work is already done.” But really, I’d argue that the work you do to prepare your mind and body in the two weeks leading up to a race is worth just as much as the physical efforts you’ve completed in the months beforehand.
If you line up at the start line as a ball of nerves you’ll be mentally ill-prepared to utilize your body at its physical peak. It takes just as much, if not more, focus and discipline to nail the taper before a race–especially when you have more free time on your hands with less training volume.",4/25/19
marathon-training-recovery-tips,A Marathoner's Guide to Staying In the Green,"Training Based on Recovery
After getting a WHOOP, I started noticing a few patterns in my HRV and sleep. In the weeks leading up to the 2019 Boston Marathon, I decided to put my habits under a microscope and hopefully figure out how to arrive at the start line feeling my best mentally and physically. So I started to track everything that I thought affected my sleep and overall feeling each morning.
As a result, I woke up Marathon Monday with an HRV three times my baseline average–it was the highest HRV I had ever seen for myself! I felt more ready for any race I’ve ever trained for and I felt ready to fight hard and to do my best.
Here’s a little background before we dive into some details: The training block leading up to Marathon Monday was as good as it could get. I averaged about fifty miles per week with speedwork, lifting, cycling, and yoga all mixed in around the runs. I ran my fastest half-marathon a month before the race and committed the next four weeks to eating extremely clean and giving up drinking (the first thing anyone will notice with a WHOOP is how a single night of drinking impacts sleep and recovery).
My marathon training was also completely injury free. I was able to avoid overuse injuries like the dreaded plantar fasciitis, or IT band syndrome. Diet, sleep, and proper recovery play a huge factor in keeping yourself healthy and your muscles pliable. When I would notice a dip in recovery scores, I’d rearrange my easy workouts and my intense workouts to let my body catch back up with the strain I was putting it through.
Some weeks I completely ditched the track workout because my HRV was consistently low. Coming from someone who has never gone through a whole winter training regime without an injury in the past, this was a pretty remarkable feat.",4/25/19
marathon-training-recovery-tips,A Marathoner's Guide to Staying In the Green,"WHOOP feedback on sleep habits helped with some more details on what led to better sleeping and HRV. I don’t quite have a schedule that allows me to commit to a regular daily bedtime/waking time, but I did my best to stay as consistent as possible. I also cut coffee out almost entirely; some mornings I’d have a few sips, but I noticed that eliminating caffeine helped get me to sleep a lot faster.
The top four things that seemed to affect my sleep are probably no big secret, but having experienced them first hand made me think, “Why on earth don’t I do this all the time?”
1. Reading (real books) before bed. The nights I read, even a page or two, increased my REM and SWS time, and sleep efficiency (see above). 2. CBD oil: I took about 40mg of CBD before bed. 3. Herbal tea before bed. 4. Fasting: I went to bed a little bit hungry having not eaten for about 2-3hrs.

marathon-training-recovery-tips,A Marathoner's Guide to Staying In the Green,"Tapering Based on Data
Additionally, I was able to be a bit more dynamic with my taper workouts by using feedback from WHOOP. I have a couple of key workouts that I like to do before a big race. One involves weight lifting and the other is a speed workout on a track. I usually just scheduled these randomly during the taper week and hope I time them correctly. When I woke up with a recovery score that was less than optimal on Thursday, instead of just muscling through it and risking injury or poor form on race day, I was able to shift my schedule to a more optimal training window the next day, allowing my body plenty of time to recover for the 26.2 miles ahead.
Two of the biggest contributors to poor sleep and HRV probably don’t come as a surprise to anyone. Going to bed checking my phone or watching TV made my recovery scores plummet, and falling asleep with a full stomach affected things even worse than phone use. Again, you might know this intuitively, but analyzing the data from WHOOP made me realize just how detrimental these behaviors were to sleep quality and recovery.
The feeling of lining up for the big A-race is amazing, but lining up for that race knowing you are confident and ready to go is surreal. If you can’t record things, you can’t improve on them. WHOOP gave me a way to track what works best for me and insight into how to do it even better next time.

marcus-filly-coach-better,Marcus Filly Shares 5 Ways WHOOP Makes Him a Better Coach,"I’ve been a WHOOP member for almost 4 years now, and the impact it has had on me as an athlete, father, and business owner is profound.
One area that I haven’t had many opportunities to share regarding my WHOOP experience is how it has affected my life as a coach and the lives of my clients. We have a community of thousands of clients worldwide and that number continues to grow.
A great number of our customers are also active WHOOP members as well. As a result of this commonality that we share around data collection and performance optimization, we have seen an elevation in the level of our conversations around health and fitness, more long-term accountability, and even a deepening of our relationships.
Below I’ll discuss the five biggest impact points we’ve had with our clients and community around WHOOP.
## 1. Getting Honest About Sleep
My best friend in medical school came from a family of two sleep scientists. Both his parents had dedicated their entire professional lives to studying sleep. That was 12 years ago, before sleep was the hot topic it is today.
What he told me back then was: “We don’t know much about sleep except that if you don’t get it, you die.” That was profound for me at the time, and that simple truth has led to more and more science and research on sleep in the past decade. We know a lot more now and as health and fitness professionals, we deeply want our clients to understand the values of sleep.
Prior to WHOOP, it was extremely hard to make this essential health topic tangible for clients. They couldn’t perceive how their sleep quality was changing, or be precise about their amount of sleep in order to make valuable improvements.
The conversation with clients has been vastly upgraded with the help of WHOOP sleep metrics, and we have a much better success rate getting clients to tune into their sleep needs and amounts. Furthermore, results in the gym for those who value their sleep have improved.",4/21/21
marcus-filly-coach-better,Marcus Filly Shares 5 Ways WHOOP Makes Him a Better Coach,"4. Community Engagement Beyond Just Workout Performance and Competition
Nothing makes me happier than to jump onto our Facebook community page and see a thread between clients about their WHOOP data. Anything from comparing sleep performance or the strain of specific activities, to discussing which behaviors they’ve found boost their recoveries.
When our community engages with each other, the retention rates improve and client success improves. We are tribal animals that value connection, and WHOOP enables us to share, connect, and compare (in both competitive and non-competitive ways) with one another.
Those who are following similar programs, coaching philosophies, or gym ethos find the comparison amongst one another something they come back to over and over again for validation and guidance. My clients want to know what other Functional Bodybuilding participants are experiencing and WHOOP helps us do that objectively.",4/21/21
marcus-filly-coach-better,Marcus Filly Shares 5 Ways WHOOP Makes Him a Better Coach,"5. Starting Point for Educational Topics for Better Living
Educating our clients over the long term is one of our company’s primary missions. We want them to accumulate lessons and knowledge that they can carry with them to improve the quality of living and the years ahead.
One important topic that WHOOP allows us to converse about is energy balance. The strain that clients perceive vs. what they actually accumulate (tracked by WHOOP) can often be very different. That workout felt hard, but was it actually a high-strain/output activity?
This becomes particularly useful when we start to expand our coaching conversations to topics of nutrition and energy balance. How much food should a client be eating relative to their goals and activity levels? When we calculate a client’s macros, as an example, we want to know their total daily activity level, not just their training strain. WHOOP helps us get a better understanding of trends in their overall energy expenditure.
Being a great coach takes practice. It also takes having the right tools that can help you lean into the most important aspects of health and fitness change. When both our coaches and clients wear WHOOP, it provides us with incredible insight to go deeper as coaches. We can develop the conversational reps, so to speak, with the clients that allow us over time to deliver better education and results.

marcus-filly-coach-better,Marcus Filly Shares 5 Ways WHOOP Makes Him a Better Coach,"2. Initiate a Dialogue About What Happens Outside the Gym
Having a tool that helps open up conversations about what our clients do outside of the gym is so useful. In a time and age when people are getting more and more protective of their personal lives, we have to keep up a dialogue about how they spend their time. That is how we get insight into habits that will lead to success in their health and fitness journey.
The data WHOOP provides our clients is a powerful conversation starter about what might be contributing to things like poor HRV numbers, or more green recovery days. It creates a connection to the habits in their lives that we don’t have the ability to see on a regular basis, but want them to be growing awareness of.
## 3. See Trends and Appreciate Long-Term Training Strategy
There is no question that the vast majority of our clients come in seeking quick solutions. The thought of having to wait for months or years to have the look or feel that they want can be daunting, and the process of getting to those long-term goals can be hard as well. Often there are periods of external plateaus and limited signs of progress.
However, the WHOOP data our clients have at their disposal serves as yet another objective metric set to help them see their progress, especially when they might not otherwise be aware it is happening.

marvel-movies-motocross-pro-stuntwoman-brittany-marcotte,Marvel Movies & Motocross: Meet Pro Stuntwoman Brittany Marcotte,"“It’s very physical. You’re running around, falling, fighting, doing all this active stuff,” she explains. “We’d perform Thursday through Sunday in a new city and a new arena every week.” The shows were exhilarating and flashy–just like being on the set of a real movie. For Brittany, however, the toughest part was the travel and simply making sure she got enough sleep.
Enter WHOOP. Brittany had heard about WHOOP from some of the CrossFit athletes she followed, but she wasn’t quite sure what it could do for her. She wasn’t familiar with HRV, and the idea of wearables or physiological monitoring in the motocross world was relatively uncharted. She just wanted a consistent sleep schedule while on tour and thought WHOOP could help.
“If I want to have a peak day tomorrow, I need exactly this much rest.”
It takes a special kind of strength to ride a 200-pound motorcycle into the air, land a jump, and then speed around a race track to do it all over again. You need to be physically strong enough to hold on to your machine mid-flight, and also absorb the shock when hitting the ground. Add in some layers of risk and adrenaline, and you have a full workout within 20 minutes of riding.
When Brittany first started wearing WHOOP, she noticed immediately that her heart rate was regularly 170-180 while performing at shows, resulting in multiple consecutive days of high strain. Combined with travel and lack of sleep, recovery was a challenge. Brittany also had a history of minor bone breaks and concussions from riding when she was younger (the scar on her right shoulder is from an old motorcycle injury), which meant it was imperative that she monitor and prioritize her physical well-being in order to be her best for each show.",8/15/19
marvel-movies-motocross-pro-stuntwoman-brittany-marcotte,Marvel Movies & Motocross: Meet Pro Stuntwoman Brittany Marcotte,"“It’s always been my dream to make a living and be successful at doing something that I love, which is riding motorcycles.”
Brittany Marcotte started riding dirt bikes when she was 11. Inspired by her dad, a former dirt bike rider, she spent most of her pre-teen and adolescent years practicing at the local SoCal race tracks. She began racing nationally at age 13 and went pro at 18, competing in the X-Games in 2013.
Despite the pro life, it was still a grind. It meant working additional odd jobs to supplement her income and sourcing sponsors, and the Women’s Motocross sport itself (WMX) was not nearly as developed as its male counterpart. So when the opportunity arose to join Marvel Universe Live and become a professional stuntwoman, she thought, “Why not?”
Black Widow on a Bike
Brittany’s career is unique. She’ll often get questions from friends or on her personal Instagram, which features videos of her flying through the air and popping wheelies, asking things like, “What do you actually do for work if all you do is ride?”
The reality is, that’s her job. “It sounds crazy, but it’s literally what I get to do,” she says. “That’s my lifestyle: riding.”
When she was invited to join the Marvel Live Universe show in 2014 as a professional stuntwoman, Brittany knew this was her next step and she retired from professional racing. Not only are stunt actors limited compared to the regular pool of actors, it’s hard to come by females in the space with the expertise and fearlessness Brittany has.
Touring with Marvel was a dream come true, but it also took a huge toll on Brittany’s body; something she could handle in her 20s, but not something she planned on doing for the rest of her life. For nearly 5 years, Brittany traveled 27 weeks straight and performed every weekend in live shows like Spiderman or Thor, each time in a different city or state. Her favorite character to play was Black Widow from Avengers.",8/15/19

It was a huge eye-opener, and it confirmed just how much strain she was putting on her body on a regular basis. “Knowing the amount of calories I burn when riding or training tells me how much fuel I need to keep me from getting fatigued.”
WHOOP is much more than just a heart rate monitor for Brittany, it’s a tool that keeps her balanced. “Honestly, it kind of instilled a habit in me. I know if I want to have a peak day tomorrow, I need exactly this much rest.”
Optimizing Performance in Every Sport
As technology advances and “the quantified self” becomes more popular, athletes from all backgrounds are seeing the value of monitoring personal physiology. In Brittany’s opinion, it doesn’t matter how niche her sport is, it’s incredibly important to maintain health and fitness if she wants to keep riding. Ultimately, wearables aren’t just for runners or gym junkies, they’re for athletes of all backgrounds, from frisbee players to NBA All-Stars. As she works towards acting in feature films as a pro stuntwoman, Brittany knows WHOOP can help her stay at the top of the game.

max-heart-rate-training-zones,A Simple Guide to Training with Heart Rate Zones,"## What is Heart rate training?
Simply put, heart rate training consists of using your heart rate to gauge your exercise intensity, and aiming for different heart rate zones depending on what your fitness goals are.
## Calculating Max Heart Rate
The first step to heart rate training is to calculate what your max heart rate is. A basic formula that is commonly used is to just subtract your age from 220. So by this method, if you’re 30 years old you’re max heart rate is 190 beats per minute. However, this equation does not take into account things specific to you, like gender, genetics, etc.
Over the years a number of more detailed formulas have been created, such as the Tanaka (208 – 0.7 x age) or the Gulati (206 – 0.88 x age, for women only), but they make broad generalizations as well and fall victim to many of the same variables. Additionally, other factors like temperature, altitude, hydration, and even time of day can affect your heart rate.
Every human body is different with varying maximum heart rates, so a better solution is to use wrist-worn heart rate monitor like WHOOP that will determine your personal max heart rate.
## What Are Heart Rate Training Zones?
Once you know your max heart rate, you can establish your own heart rate training zones. Below is a graphic listing the various heart rate zones and what you can accomplish by training in each. For example, if you’re exercising and your heart rate is at 50-60% of your max HR, your workout is ideal for warm ups and cool downs, or active recovery.
Heart Rate Zones Chart",5/14/21
max-heart-rate-training-zones,A Simple Guide to Training with Heart Rate Zones,"Fat Burning Heart Rate
Weight loss is a common goal for many of us, and people often wonder which zone is best for burning fat. While training at 60-70% of your max HR technically burns more fat than more intense exercise (when your body shifts to burning more carbohydrates instead), losing weight is actually about burning calories. You can sustain activity longer at a lower heart rate, but you’ll burn more calories when you increase your exertion.
There’s no reason to avoid training at a higher heart rate range if you’re trying to lose weight.
## Aerobic Heart Rate Zone vs Anaerobic
Aerobic exercise is when your body is able to take in enough oxygen to sustain how physically active you are without dipping into another energy source. Working out at 70-80% of your max HR (moderate intensity) will improve your aerobic fitness level. This will allow you to build endurance and create lean muscle for things like distance running or cycling. It’s also good for your overall cardiac health.
Anaerobic exercise causes your muscles to need more energy than is provided by the oxygen you are breathing in, so they begin to break down sugars and produce lactic acid. A target heart rate of 80-90% of your max (vigorous intensity) will increase your lactate threshold. This heart rate zone is often useful to improve performance in weightlifting and other non-endurance sports that require power output.",5/14/21
max-heart-rate-training-zones,A Simple Guide to Training with Heart Rate Zones,"Benefits of Heart Rate Training
As a general rule, most athletes will want to train in varying zones of max heart rate at different times, both within specific workouts and from one to the next. A typical one-hour session might include 10 minutes in the 50-60% target zone warming up and cooling down, 30 minutes at a sustainable pace at 60-70%, 12 minutes pushing a little more at 70-80%, 6 minutes going hard at 80-90% and 2 minutes all-out at 90-100%.
Monitoring your workout heart rate can help you avoid training too hard by knowing exactly when you’re overexerting yourself. It will also allow you to bounce back faster by ensuring you stay in the proper zone on recovery days.
Additionally, heart rate training enables you to moderate external factors like heat and humidity, or better adjust on days when you may not be fully recovered. In these cases, your standard workout may be increasing your heart rate more than usual.
## Know Your Heart Rate Zones in Real Time with WHOOP
WHOOP measures your heart rate 24/7 and quantifies the strain your body takes on each day. Every morning, our recovery metric (calculated using heart rate variability, resting heart rate, respiratory rate and sleep) tells you how prepared your body is to take on strain. And when you track your activities with the WHOOP Strain Target, you can see in real time which heart rate zone you’re in, so you’ll know exactly when to dial it back, or kick it up a notch.
You can also retroactively view the time you spent in each heart rate zone by tapping into your Activity. WHOOP will show you a detailed breakdown of time in each zone so you can further optimize your training.",5/14/21

measure-normal-blood-oxygen-levels,"What is Blood Oxygen, What Are Normal Levels & How to Measure It","How WHOOP Monitors Blood Oxygen
While the most familiar pulse oximeters are those that are placed on your finger, the same technology is utilized in many other devices, including the WHOOP 4.0, to monitor blood oxygen levels from the wrist.
The WHOOP 4.0 does this by sending two wavelengths of light (red and infrared) through your skin where it is absorbed and reflected by blood vessels. The red and infrared light each get absorbed differently by hemoglobin (the red blood cells that can bind with oxygen), and their absorption changes if the hemoglobin is oxygenated or not. By comparing the relative amount of light that gets reflected back from each of the wavelengths, we are able to track what percentage of red blood cells are oxygenated.
So, for example, if 96% of them are oxygenated and 4% are not, then your SpO2 is 96%.
The WHOOP 4.0 measures your blood oxygen level while you’re sleeping at night (which allows for the most consistent and reliable readings), then reports it to you each morning via the Health Monitor, which tracks key vitals including live heart rate, resting heart rate, heart rate variability, respiratory rate, and skin temperature.
The WHOOP 4.0 Health Monitor alerts you if blood oxygen levels or other key physiological metrics stray too far from their normal baseline.

measure-normal-blood-oxygen-levels,"What is Blood Oxygen, What Are Normal Levels & How to Measure It","Your blood oxygen level refers to the amount of oxygen you have circulating in your blood. It is most commonly measured through a process known as “pulse oximetry.” Low blood oxygen levels can be associated with a variety of different health issues.
Below we’ll take a deeper dive into the basics of blood oxygen levels and pulse oximetry.
## What Does Blood Oxygen Level Show?
The human body needs to constantly be supplied with oxygen in order to function. We breathe it in through the nose and mouth, then our lungs transfer it into the bloodstream where it is then distributed throughout the body. Oxygen is carried in your blood by red blood cells. As it travels around the body, oxygen helps provide energy, replace worn out cells, and support internal organs and systems.
Your blood oxygen level shows how much oxygen is being circulated by your red blood cells, and it is very closely regulated by your body. Keeping it within a specific range is necessary to ensure that all the cells in your body are getting enough oxygen. Maintaining the proper balance of oxygen saturation in your blood is extremely important for your health.
The level of oxygen in your blood indicates how efficiently your body is dispersing oxygen from your lungs to your cells. Low levels can be a sign that there is something wrong with your lungs or blood circulation.
If you’ve tested positive for COVID-19 and are experiencing symptoms, low blood oxygen levels may be a red flag that you’re in need of medical attention.

measure-normal-blood-oxygen-levels,"What is Blood Oxygen, What Are Normal Levels & How to Measure It","What is a Normal Blood Oxygen Level?
There are two ways to measure your blood oxygen level. One is an arterial blood gas test (ABG test), which is uncomfortable and invasive and requires a doctor to draw blood from one of your arteries (arteries carry oxygenated blood and deliver it to the body, then veins return it to the heart).
The other is with pulse oximetry, which does it quickly and painlessly by shining light through capillary veins near the surface of your skin. Pulse oximetry measures the percentage of oxygen in your blood (oxygen saturation level) and is known as SpO2.
A normal blood oxygen level is between 95% and 100%.
This number is likely to vary for people with lung diseases and other particular medical issues. An SpO2 below 90% is considered low, and referred to as hypoxemia.

## Causes and Symptoms of Low Blood Oxygen Levels
Here are several potential symptoms of low blood oxygen levels:
Heavy breathing or shortness of breath
Chest pains
Elevated heart rate and blood pressure
Headaches and dizziness
Restless feeling
Confusion or loss of coordination
Impaired vision
Cyanosis
Low levels of blood oxygen can be caused by changes in your environment, most notably high-altitude conditions where there is less oxygen in the air.
From a medical standpoint, a low SpO2 may be caused by anemia (insufficient red blood cells) or congenital heart diseases where the heart is unable to pump enough oxygenated blood. Additionally, lung ailments and things that decrease your body’s ability to take in oxygen often lead to low blood oxygen levels as well, including:
Asthma
Bronchitis
Sleep apnea
Pneumonia
COVID-19 or other viral infections
Emphysema (when the lungs’ air sacs are damaged, usually from smoking)

We explore “what’s typical” for all aspects of your data, from average time in bed to recovery norms by day of the week. It’s all broken down based on the three pillars of WHOOP, recovery, strain and sleep.
## Recovery
Starting with the basics, the average daily recovery for WHOOP members is 58%. That number peaks at the beginning of the work week, then dips gradually as the week progresses. Females generally have slightly higher recoveries than males do (about 1%), and even more so on weekends (roughly 2%):
## Heart Rate Variability
A major contributor to your daily recovery is heart rate variability (HRV). The average HRV for WHOOP members is 64 ms, but it is a metric that fluctuates significantly. Below you can see ranges for the middle 50% of people based on age (HRV usually declines as you get older):
Learn More: NORMAL HRV RANGE BY AGE AND GENDER
## Resting Heart Rate
Resting heart rate (RHR) is also factored into recovery. WHOOP members’ average RHR is 56 bpm, which increases slightly with age (females’ RHR is a bit higher than males’):
## Respiratory Rate
And finally, the last metric we use to calculate recovery (other than sleep, more on that to come) is respiratory rate, your average breaths per minute while sleeping. For most WHOOP members this is between 13 and 18:

## Strain’s Effect on Recovery
It’s also worth noting the impact of strain on next-day recovery. The graphic that follows shows the decrease in average daily recovery in relation to increased strain the day before. For example, spanning everyone who had a 15 strain yesterday, their average recovery today was just shy of 56%:",4/23/21

Work can be demanding on our mental health. In 2021, Gallup research found 57% of US and Canadian workers reported feeling stressed on a daily basis, compared to 43% of people who felt that way globally. The rates were significantly higher for women working in the US and Canada where 62% of working women reported daily stress. These rates reflect the impact of gendered expectations in the household and childcare, and women’s higher representation in low-wage jobs during the pandemic.
While there are things companies can do to support their employees’ life/work balance, there are actions you can take at work to support your own mental health and relieve anxiety.
Going For a Walk
You probably can’t get up and leave a meeting and expect to still have a job, but walking during your lunch break may help you feel better able to meet that tight deadline.
Walking can improve your mood, sleep quality, and reduce stress. It also reduces tiredness that affects mental alertness, so a mid-day walk may make you feel active in the afternoon. Walking gives you time to think (you can practice visualization while you walk), and it boosts your mood by increasing your heart rate and circulation to the brain and body.
If you invite your work friends to walk with you during lunch you’ll get the benefits of walking and social interaction, which can help ward off negative thoughts and improve self-esteem.
Deep Breathing
Similar to visualization, deep breathing relaxes your body and alleviates anxiety. Deep breathing also goes by the terms paced breathing, belly breathing, and abdominal breathing, and involves engaging your diaphragm muscles in each breath.",5/2/22

Visualization
Some of the world’s greatest athletes use visualization to see themselves where they want to be. NFL MVP and Super Bowl champion Patrick Mahomes told the WHOOP Podcast that uses the technique to picture plays and winning games.
“If you watch me before a game, 3 or 4 hours before a game, I’m just walking the field and just watching and visualizing the play happening and throwing the ball to [Travis] Kelce…. [I’m] visualizing the success. Visualizing going out there and winning the championships and winning the Super Bowl. [I’m able] to embrace those moments when I’m in them because I’ve seen it happen before.”
Visualization is a technique that uses your imagination to experience a desired outcome. It works by making you refocus your thoughts from the things you’re worrying about to what you want to happen. Athletes use it to increase confidence and decrease anxiety before a game or a race. You can use it to become more relaxed, confident, and motivated when you’re feeling stressed about a situation–for example, a project at work. In this case, you can imagine having completed the work project successfully and your boss and colleagues are thrilled with the outcome.
There are many techniques for visualization that work for different circumstances. If you have trouble sleeping, it may help to picture yourself lying on a serene beach with the hot sun beating down on you, white sand between your toes, and gentle waves lapping onto the shore nearby.

When you choose to positively deal with stressful thoughts the entire family can benefit; not just from your improved mood and ability to cope, but also from taking part in activities with you. Spending time with your kids reduces everyone’s anxieties and may improve family relationships.
Here are a few things that can support the entire family’s mental health:
Going Outside
Taking the kids for a walk, whether it’s around the block or on a hike, can reduce your anxiety and your kids’ chances of developing depression later in life. It will also improve their sleep patterns.
Gardening
Even growing a small patio garden improves focus and concentration, and connects the entire family to nature. Exposure to plants and green space lowers heart rate and muscle tension. According to one Japanese study, simply looking at plants also reduces anger and sadness
Coloring
Coloring is not just for kids. There are dozens of coloring books on the market designed for adults. Coloring and doodling can induce a meditative state as you focus on your present creativity. It improves your motor skills and focus, and reduces anxiety.
Reading
Reading books (rather than a screen) lowers your heart rate as effectively as yoga. Reading before bed is one technique to fall asleep faster, have better sleep, and increased recovery the next day.
Reading to your kids is a relaxing activity that many parents choose to do as part of their bedtime routine. Reading about others’ experiences teaches kids how to handle emotions and empathy, builds vocabulary, and can reinforce your familial bond.",5/2/22

Consequently, you may feel short of breath, anxious, or tense. Whether you’re typing at a desk or driving a truck, you may not realize your breath is coming short and shallow.
Deep breathing usually takes a conscious effort to open your breathing passages, expand your belly, and pull air into the lowest parts of your lungs. There are many approaches to deep breathing, and several come from yoga traditions. As little as 1 minute of diaphragmatic breathing a few times per day has been shown to have a beneficial effect on the cardiopulmonary system and activate your parasympathetic nervous system. One of the easiest deep breathing techniques is box breathing:
Singing In the Car
It sounds silly, but singing in the car is a great way to relieve tension after a hard day at work. Whether you prefer rap, K-pop, or metal, singing along to your favorite songs releases endorphins, diminishing anxiety.

Accessing feelings of gratitude, doing random acts of kindness, and reliving positive experiences directly activates brain regions associated with the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine is our energy neurotransmitter and we need appropriate levels to feel energetic and excited about life. It is also an important communication mediator at the neural-immune level (Basu, 2000) and there is recent evidence to suggest a direct and indirect role in modulating the immune system (Toth, et. al. 2012).
Daily gratitude practice is also linked to lower blood pressure, drops in stress hormones, optimized testosterone and estrogen release, and an increased capacity to be present (Redwine et. al., 2016)–all good things as it relates to immune health. A great way to facilitate the release of this “feel-good compound” is to write down positive experiences and feelings of gratitude in a journal each day!",4/10/20

Stress is often defined as an organism’s ability to adapt to environmental and psychological demands which result in biological changes that either support health, or could place you at risk for illness (Salleh, 2008). The relationship between stress and illness is complex and varies from person to person. Events in our lives collide with a host of physiological and psychological factors to either protect us from illness or make us more vulnerable.
Some of the factors that influence susceptibility to stress and potential illness are: Genetic vulnerability, sleep behavior, mental coping tools/skills, outlook on life, exercise habits, sleep behavior, hydration habits, recovery behavior, exposure to environment, and social support (Salleh, 2008).
Unmanaged stressors and self-sabotaging behaviors can accumulate in subtle ways and dampen the body’s ability to respond optimally to the demands of the environment, and over time weaken the immune system.
But, I have great news! There are behaviors you can adopt demonstrated in clinical studies to have a powerful impact on your mental, physical, and emotional well-being, thereby buoying immunity and general wellness.",4/10/20

Before I go into ways to boost immunity, a quick note on the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) and its role in mediating interactions between the nervous and immune systems, two important adaptive systems. The ANS is part of the nervous system that governs non-voluntary responses and is broken into two branches, sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS). SNS is the activating branch and PSNS is the deactivating branch.
The key working principle to understand is that autonomic-immune physiological processing determines how the immune system engages with your ANS, in turn influencing the regulation of the level of activity in SNS and PSNS. In simple terms, ANS and immunity seem innately linked (Kenney and Ganta, 2014). A heart that is highly responsive to cues from the ANS (the faster you can switch gears!) is a sign of robustness and resilience. A heart that is slow to respond to cues from ANS (struggles to switch gears) is a sign of under-recovery and greater susceptibility to illness.",4/10/20

5. FOCUS TIME AND ATTENTION ON WHAT YOU CAN CONTROL
We put undue stress on our system when we focus on things that are outside of our immediate influence. You can find peace by focusing on the things in your life you can control directly. A feeling of “inner peace” improves and stabilizes our self-image and frees up energy to direct toward our larger aspirations and goals (Beutel, 2016).
It is important to understand that feeling we have control over our life is a core psychological need (Ryan and Deci, 2000). One of the sabotaging behaviors that interfere with “control” is procrastination related to relationships, health, and the “daily grind.” Procrastination is often associated with depression, stress and anxiety, which ultimately interfere with healthy autonomic balance.
Big projects need a plan, relationships need a plan, and “little” things need a plan too (e.g., laundry, clutter, bills). Procrastination can add psychological weight which will manifest internally and put pressure on your system in ways that are not immediately perceptible. Feeling organized and in control (however you define it) stimulates and increases the tone of the vagus nerve which helps your nervous system speak to your cardiovascular system in a more efficient way. Efficiency equates to HRV increase and a stronger defense system!
To augment feelings of control, think about organizing life demands into 4 buckets:
Repeatable habits you can control that contribute to personal happiness and well-being.
Big projects.
Relationship “needs” you can directly influence.

Identify your core values then ensure your behaviors align as often as possible.
Chronic misalignment between your core values and actual behaviors fosters internal tension and can create unproductive anxiety and suppress immunity (Salleh, 2008). Knowing what matters to you and who matters to you brings clarity to your decision making and allows you to focus your time, energy, and attention in a way that is in line with your core values. The goal is not to construct a perfect life, but rather an honest reflection of your interior life.
Consider the following exercise to help identify core values:
Identify 3 words that describe your aspirational self (i.e. peaceful, tolerant, and innovative).
What behavior does this word drive? In my case, “peace” comes when I am honest, present, helping others, and practicing gratitude daily.
Which thoughts get in the way of living this value? For example, thinking and worrying about the future and desiring unessentials.
What daily actions would enable me to live this value more fully? For me, it’s mindfulness practice and allocating quality time with my loved ones daily.

2. ADOPT A GROWTH MINDSET
“Ninety percent of our long-term happiness, success, and general well-being is predicted not by the external world, but by the way your brain processes the world. “It stands to reason if we alter our lens, if we change the formula for happiness and success, we can change the way that we can then affect reality.” (Achor, 2012)
Most of our unproductive emotions that cause us distress and suppress immune function (anger, jealousy, insecurity, guilt, shame, etc.) are rooted in fear, while positive emotions that release stress and boost immunity (confidence, grace, optimism, gratitude, courage etc.) are rooted in trust. The positive emotions that support immune health begin with being comfortable with who you are and ensuring outlets and skill building around the things that bring you joy and energy.
To begin the process, a helpful exercise is to write down a list of “typical behaviors” (i.e., how you spend your time) and then list what emotions you associate with these behaviors. The behaviors/actions that yield negative emotions might be the ones that are compromising your health. Consciously replacing behaviors that yield negative feelings and emotions is a critical next step. “Deprogramming” can be difficult, but when you ask questions of your behaviors and its effect (i.e., is it making me healthier, happier and more energetic?) all of a sudden there is clarity.
Consciously building a personal system that includes behaviors that elevate positive emotions and enable a growth mindset is an awesome way to bolster resilience and immune health (Koh, 1998).",4/10/20

At WHOOP, we measure heart rate variability (HRV), which is a function of the heart but originates in the ANS (the “switching gears” mentioned above). HRV is the variation in the time interval between one heartbeat and the next and is an excellent estimator of your overall immune health (decrease in variability means the heart is less responsive to signaling from the ANS, increase in variability means the heart is responsive to cues). When your immune system is compromised you will generally see a suppression in your HRV relative to your baseline. In this state, your system is working overtime to maintain the processes required for physiological homeostasis. As a result, your body is less capable of adapting to acute stressors.
Here are some science-backed choices to consider building into your life to increase your heart’s ability to respond to cues from the ANS and potentially strengthen immunity–think of it as “adaptation energy!”

There is an overview of the new Health Monitor that appears on the homepage when you first open the WHOOP app.
SpO2 can be found via the health monitor bar from the WHOOP 4.0 app overview screen.
Clicking on it will bring you to the Health Monitor, which displays your blood oxygen level.
SpO2 is one of six key metrics displayed in the Health Monitor.
The Health Monitor can also be accessed via the plan tab on the menu bar at the bottom of your app screen.
The plan tab in the WHOOP app shows if your SpO2 and other Health Monitor metrics are within their typical range.
## Why is Knowing Blood Oxygen Levels Useful?
Normal SpO2 levels range from 95% to 100%. Low blood oxygen levels may be caused by a number of health problems. For example, If you have COVID-19 and are experiencing other symptoms, low blood oxygen can be an indicator that you should seek medical attention.
High-altitude conditions where there is less oxygen in the air can also have an effect on your SpO2. Monitoring your blood oxygen levels regularly is very useful for athletes who are training at high altitude to ensure they are not pushing themselves too hard in a new environment.
Knowing your baseline metrics has never been more important, and the new Health Monitor feature alerts you via a color-coded system if your SpO2 or other vitals stray beyond their typical range.

metric-blood-oxygen-monitoring,New WHOOP 4.0 Metric: Blood Oxygen Monitoring,"Below we’ll discuss what this new metric is, how we measure it, where to find it in the WHOOP app, and how it can benefit you.
## What is Blood Oxygen Monitoring?
Monitoring your blood oxygen level is simply checking the amount of oxygen you have circulating through your bloodstream. It can be done very easily through a process called “pulse oximetry.” The oxygen level of your blood is measured as a percentage, referred to as SpO2. If the oxygen saturation of your blood drops too low, it may be symptomatic of several potential health issues.
## How Does WHOOP Track Blood Oxygen?
With a new sensor configuration that includes 5 LEDs and 4 photodiodes, the WHOOP 4.0 is now equipped to accurately monitor blood oxygen levels with pulse oximetry.
Although most common pulse oximeters track your blood oxygen from your finger, WHOOP implements the same technology to calculate SpO2 on your wrist. Here’s how it works:
The LEDs shine two different wavelengths of light through the surface of your skin to your blood vessels
The light is reflected back to the photodiodes, with one wavelength being absorbed better by oxygenated hemoglobin and the other absorbed better by non-oxygenated hemoglobin
The relative amounts of light that get absorbed can be used to determine how much oxygen is in your blood, and that percentage represents your SpO2 level
WHOOP measures your blood oxygen level each night while you are asleep in order to get as reliable and consistent readings as possible. Every morning, you can check your SpO2 on the Health Monitor.",9/13/21

When people don’t sleep well, they don’t think and perform well. Whether you’re an athlete, business woman, or student, sleep may be the most important function in the effort to grow and perform toward the upper limits of human potential. There is no way around sleep. Sleep is complicated and multi-dimensional. As it relates to performance and wellness, it’s a massive contributor to both. Long gone are the days where people on the world’s stage say “I’m proud I’m only getting 6 hours of sleep a night.” Admitting that you’re getting below average sleep is like raising your hand to announce “Hey everyone, I just want to let you know that I’m completely functioning at a substandard level.” Eventually, your brain either lowers the standards of what’s possible for you, or it just shuts you down. Think about that! Your brain has the ability, under sleep restriction, to conserve its spending of resources by downgrading the intensity of output. In other words, when you’re not getting enough sleep, your brain takes over to slow you down. That slowing down not only impacts cognitive functioning (slower reaction time and slower processing of complicated ideas), but also impacts our hormonal functioning and our physical body composition.

Most world-class performers who I’ve spent time with would rather be completely switched-on and highly engaged for 960 minutes, versus skimp on sleep minutes to have more waking moments that are substandard. There’s also a host of health concerns associated with sleep restrictions. As a population, we are sleeping less than we ever have.

mitigate-strain-summer-heat-thermoregulation,Your Secret Weapon to Mitigate Strain in the Summer Heat,"How do you mitigate strain in the heat? The key process in the summer months is evaporation. I know, you’re probably thinking how can I sweat more to keep me cool via evaporation. Well, it’s not all about sweating more, it’s about having a healthy method of cooling your body down, which can be achieved via proper hydration. When exercising in the summer months, you’re putting more stress on your body and your core temperature will be slightly higher than when training and racing in cooler months. Therefore, if you focus on drinking early and often when exercising, you’ll mitigate the stress you’re putting on your body, and will allow your body to properly cool via hydration.
One important note–water alone may not always cut it. Water provides fluid but it doesn’t have everything your body wants when it’s under stress. Your hydration needs both carbohydrates and electrolytes during high stress environments and/or longer exercises (90+ min) to help hydrate efficiently.
And as you know, staying hydrated during the workout alone won’t be enough. Going into a workout well hydrated goes a long way. It delays the onset of dehydration (which naturally occurs during exercise) and helps you perform better. Topping off your electrolyte stores the night before (or at least 1-2 hours before) exercise will help ensure you have enough electrolytes to move fluids through your body.

mitigate-strain-summer-heat-thermoregulation,Your Secret Weapon to Mitigate Strain in the Summer Heat,"Hydration starts (and ultimately ends) with thermoregulation, a natural process that allows your body to maintain its core internal temperature, which keeps the body cool when functioning efficiently. Body temperature regulation can be achieved by proper hydration, but before we dig any further, let’s remind ourselves how our body naturally keeps us cool. There are four main processes or methods our bodies use to run smoothly:
Evaporation: The release of heat through sweat, by converting water into gas.
Radiation: The transfer of heat from object to object through infrared waves (sunlight).
Convection: The release of heat through the movement of air or water, such as specialized fabrics with cooling technology.
Conduction: The release of heat through physical contact.
When your body is cool, you put less stress on your stomach, which can alleviate GI distress, decrease the onset of muscle cramps, and increase your exercise performance. Within your WHOOP data, you may notice a higher strain on especially hot days, even if you’re going about your normal diet and workout routine. This is to be expected, as your body is requiring more cardiovascular exertion to achieve the same performance results. It’s why runners, for instance, use conversion charts to adjust for a slower pace in higher temperatures.",7/18/19

You can see that this member’s running activities range from 20 minutes to 2 hours, but stay within the 8-15 strain range–their more intense runs took less time to complete.
The member’s weightlifting activities are all within the 5-9 strain range, but took between 45 minutes and 2:15 to achieve these strains. You can use this chart in conjunction with the Strain Target’s optimal strain recommendation to decide the sport and duration that will get you to your goal strain for the day.

This page of the Monthly Performance Assessment puts all the data into context by showing how you balanced strain and recovery (top), and how your cardiovascular fitness (bottom) responded to that training over the past 6 months. The top graph is adapted from the first page of your Weekly Performance Assessment, but shown as a time-series instead of a scatter-plot. The gray line shows the difference between your optimal and actual strain, with higher values indicating periods of overreaching and lower values indicating restorative periods. Sustained periods of overreaching or restoring are highlighted in red and blue, respectively.
charts illustrating how your body responds to training stimuli, including trends in HRV and RHR.
In the bottom section of the page, you can see how your body responded to your training behavior. If you were overreaching and then your heart rate variability and resting heart rate improved, that’s a sign that the overreaching was functional and you are more fit because of it. If, however, your HRV and RHR got worse following the overreaching period, that can indicate non-functional overreaching.
Similarly, periods of rest can result in a physiological restoration that enables harder training and better performance – think tapering before a big competition – or can lead to loss of fitness and detraining. Looking at the top and bottom graphs together can help to understand if your training had the intended impact.
This member’s data shows that a long period of restorative training in January and February negatively impacted HRV and RHR. In March you can see they started getting closer to optimal training, followed by a short period of overreaching. The green lines on the HRV and RHR adaptation graphs in the spring months show how their cardiovascular fitness came back to the levels they had in January.

This section of the Monthly Performance Assessment gives members a way of breaking down cardiovascular load by strain and time in heart rate zones across different sports and activities. This member recorded running, weightlifting, and golf workouts, as well as a number of unspecified activities in May.
The Strain By Day of Week graph shows how much of your day strain comes from the different activities you log. The width of every bar and the strain next to each corresponds to your average strain on that day of the week. The colors in the bar indicate the amount of strain attributable to each sport/activity, with white space indicating strain accrued outside of your logged activities.

The figure above shows that the member’s primary contributions to strain came from running (see color code in next graphic), which is supplemented by weightlifting and golf on the weekend. Based on the size of the Tuesday bar, we can determine that they ran consistently on Tuesdays and at a decent strain. The Friday running bar is smaller, which could indicate they ran every Friday at lower strains or that they might have skipped a Friday run once or twice during the month.
We also provide summary statistics about workouts logged and show a comparison to the previous month. This member logged a total of 24 workouts in May, compared to 19 in April. Of those, 17 were running, 5 weightlifting, 1 activity, and 1 golf. They worked out for a total of 24 hours and 1 minute during May, with an average workout strain of 11.7.

murph-challenge-tips-from-crossfits-haley-adams-and-noah-ohlsen,Murph Challenge Tips from CrossFit’s Haley Adams and Noah Ohlsen,"The Murph Challenge takes place in gyms across the United States on Memorial Day weekend. It’s a tradition that honors Lt. Michael Murphy, a US Navy SEAL who was killed in Afghanistan in 2005. The workout began as a memorial to Lt. Murphy and now has worldwide participants. It consists of:
1-mile run
100 pull-ups
200 push-ups
300 air squats
Another 1-mile run
All while wearing a 20-pound vest or body armor
Two of the world’s fittest athletes, Noah Ohlsen and Haley Adams, have completed the Murph in the past. Haley and Noah have some tips on preparing for the Murph, how to manage every stage, successfully completing the challenge, and recovering well.
## Preparing for the Murph
Noah: The last few years I’ve always had a qualifying event the weekend before Murph so it’s not the ideal preparation, but on occasion I will tackle it on Memorial Day anyway! Ideally, you’d be able to rest up the day before and make sure you’re properly fueled and hydrated. The day of I try to eat a small meal prior to, similar to a normal training day.
Haley: Before Murph, I try to make sure I’m hydrated, have a solid workout plan, and make sure I remember why I’m doing it in the first place.

Running
Haley: Start the first run conservatively. There’s lots of work to be done after that so making sure you’re feeling good after the first run is very important. Running with a weight vest fatigues you much more so it’s important to keep that in mind when deciding how to pace the workout.
Pull-ups
Noah: Because the pull-ups are at the front end of Murph, it can be tempting to do big sets while you’re feeling fresh. I’d recommend being conservative and breaking those up in a way that is sustainable to you because you’ll likely still have 30+ min of work when you get past them. I would like to do them in quick sets of 10 with short breaks.
Haley: Start with small sets. Going to failure is not a good idea because these are big numbers of reps that need to be completed. Small and conservative sets are the way to go.
Push-ups
Noah: I’ve heard it said that push-ups are the toughest part of this workout, and I may have to agree. 200 reps on the isolated muscles of your chest shoulders and arms can cause you to burn out quickly. Similar to the pull-ups, you may feel good on your first set and want to come out big but that could catch up to you quickly! I’d try to choose a number that you think you’ll be able to maintain throughout and when those fall off, just keep chipping away.
If you insist on starting bigger when you feel good, choose a middle ground number that won’t blow you up. If you’re capable of opening with a set of 30, maybe instead do a few sets of 15s, then drop it to 10s, and then 5s, because you’ll run into fatigue undoubtedly. Best of luck, friends!

my-product-launch-was-harder-than-a-marathon-to-recover-from,My Product Launch was Harder than a Marathon to Recover From,"At WHOOP, we do a lot to monitor the human body, especially for athletes. WHOOP is the first wearable company to frame the world in terms of Strain and Recovery. Strain is the amount of cardiovascular load undergone in a workout or over the course of the day; Recovery is how prepared your body is to take on Strain.
There are two important ways to monitor the Strain-Recovery relationship. First, on a daily basis, you want to match your body’s Strain with its level of Recovery. If you have a higher Recovery, you want to take on more Strain and if you have a lower Recovery, you should take on less (or just rest). It’s a pretty simple concept that billions of people every day have no notion of. For athletes, that relationship determines whether they’re overtraining (a leading cause of injury), undertraining, or training optimally. We have a number of case studies to prove the importance of this relationship.
The second way to monitor this relationship is by examining how fast your body can recover from Strain. For example, if you run a marathon, how long did it take for your body to fully recover? Well, I’ll tell you.
I’ve been wearing a WHOOP Strap 24/7 for nearly four years, which to my knowledge is one of the largest collections of continuous, accurate physiological data ever recorded on a human being. That’s exciting because it means I have an overwhelming amount of data to baseline myself throughout different periods of time.
Using WHOOP data, here’s how my body responded to both the marathon and the product launch compared to my one-year average:

my-product-launch-was-harder-than-a-marathon-to-recover-from,My Product Launch was Harder than a Marathon to Recover From,"A Story of Stress vs. Strain: How My Product Launch was Harder to Recover from than the Boston Marathon
Yes, your day job may be harder to recover from than a marathon. It was for me.
___
On April 18, 2016, I ran the Boston Marathon. It was my first marathon and, despite being a former Division I athlete and someone who exercises regularly, I wasn’t physically prepared. I was injured for six weeks leading up to the race and my longest successful run before it was only 14 miles. My last long run prior to the marathon was in 12-degree weather and, on race day, it was 70 degrees in Boston.
After 10 miles I had such intense cramps in both my legs that I found myself lying on my back on the side of the road getting massaged by fans–not a great feeling with more than 16 miles to go. Over the remainder of the race I entered eight medical tents for treatment, where I received leg massages, salt tablets and water gels.
I probably should have quit.
But I was running for TUGG and Level Ground MMA, as well as the people who trained alongside me. My mind is stronger than my body. At least that’s what I always tell myself.
On July 18, 2016, three months to the day after I ran the marathon, we announced the launch of the WHOOP Strap 2.0, our first product available to the public. I was up late into the night all weekend preparing videos and designs for our website. Then on Monday morning, we issued a press release about Strap 2.0 and all of our Olympians training for Rio. I travelled down to Manhattan for eight different interviews: USA Today, NBC, Wall Street Journal, NPR, Reuters, Yahoo, Wired… A combination of television, radio, and print. It was a busy day to say the least. Throughout the rest of the week I followed up on the interviews and watched our sales spike. I had survived and I actually felt pretty good.
But, therein lies the problem with how we understand our own bodies.",4/12/17
my-product-launch-was-harder-than-a-marathon-to-recover-from,My Product Launch was Harder than a Marathon to Recover From,"I highlight in red the metrics that are the worst in a particular category, and in green the metrics that are the best. HRV stands for Heart Rate Variability. If you don’t know what HRV is, you can read about it here. In short, it’s the key into understanding your autonomic nervous system. Previously, it could only be monitored via ECGs in hospitals. Then more recently, by chest straps. Now, WHOOP monitors HRV from the comfort of a wrist-worn device. Mark my words, one day every living human will continuously tracking their HRV; it’s that powerful.
HRV and WHOOP Recovery are the two most important metrics for understanding how well my body was bouncing back from the Strain of the marathon and the product launch. Not surprisingly, my HRV and Recovery were dramatically lower than my one-year averages during these two stressful weeks.
The most fascinating finding here? My product launch was significantly harder to recover from than my 26.2-mile race. During the product launch, my HRV was 20% lower than my one-year average and clearly I wasn’t sleeping well. It’s interesting that I slept slightly better following the marathon than even my one-year average. This isn’t unusual: We’ve seen physical strain improve sleep performance for athletes, while stress can have the opposite effect.
If you’re an athlete, or specifically a runner, you can understand how completing my first marathon left me physically exhausted for weeks. And if you’re a founder, CEO or executive, you can sympathize with the fact that releasing my startup’s first product to the public was incredibly draining. But, would you have thought the product launch would take more out of me?

my-quest-for-glory-on-the-sled,My Quest for Glory on the Sled,"That was during my junior year of college. I went out to the combine in Lake Placid that summer and signed up for a driving school for the following season. I loved the sport immediately, but I decided to finish my degree in Colorado before going after it full time. Once I graduated, I moved to Park City in the winter of 2012-13. While my friends moved to big cities and got “real” jobs, I picked up a couple of retail jobs in Park City while training at the track five nights a week. I continued that for two seasons until I got an invite to Team Trials (our U.S. team selection races) for the next season.
People often ask me if I’m afraid on the sled.
When you’re a rookie just starting out, they only take you halfway up the track. They hold your feet and tell you to get on and look where you want to go. Then they slowly move you higher and higher up the track. My first day from the top was a little nerve-wracking.
You get used to the fear kind of being a part of it, but with each new season the nerves always come back with the anticipation after taking five months off. There’s no half speed in our sport. Once you get on the sled you’re going, and you’re going full speed. You better know what turns are coming and what your steers are.
Any first day on a new track you always think “Man, I hope I know what I’m doing.” Before you’ve seen a track, all you can do is watch point-of-view video and look at the notes from teammates who’ve been there before. You just hope you have it dialed in and you know how to react if something goes wrong. I would say the only time I’m actually scared is after a crash when I have to go back to the top of that same track.
Beyond the fear, the intensity of the speed and g-forces of skeleton on a good run still has quite an effect on your body. I wore WHOOP on a few practice runs last fall and my heart rate was crazy high. Here’s one example of my data during a run in October:",6/3/17
my-quest-for-glory-on-the-sled,My Quest for Glory on the Sled,"I first discovered WHOOP last summer when I was in the Olympic training center and some other athletes were using it. I really liked the app interface and how they were able to wear it all the time. The band being waterproof makes it easy to leave on all the time and was even more helpful last offseason when I was recovering from hip surgery and doing a lot of rehab in the pool.
I love having the feedback from WHOOP on what my body is doing. You get your sleep recommendation every night, and as an athlete it’s really nice to have something to aim for. The Recovery aspect is huge as well. It gives you a better idea of when you can push a little harder in workouts. Having a number to base things off of is a big help. Obviously you listen to your body, but when your Recovery is high you know you’re fine and can really go for it.
We’re one of very few sports that has a true offseason. All of our tracks are in the northern hemisphere and none of them are iced in the summer, so we go 5-6 months with absolutely zero sliding. That’s the time everyone uses to recover and rehab injuries, as well as to build strength and speed to improve their starts.
During runs, we push the sled for the first 20+ meters. So in the offseason, we train sort of like super short distance sprinters. Each week I usually do three days of lifting and three days of sprinting, with some conditioning, core and rehab mixed in as well.
This offseason and upcoming season are obviously huge. 2018 is the Games in PyeongChang. In an Olympic sport, that is the end game. At the moment, my top priority is getting stronger and faster so my push is where it needs to be. That and getting my hip rehabbed and comfortable so I’m not fighting it all season.",6/3/17
my-quest-for-glory-on-the-sled,My Quest for Glory on the Sled,"How did I get into skeleton?
I grew up in Modesto, California as the oldest of three children. My family was always fairly active, up in the mountains skiing, or out at the lake waterskiing, inner tubing and wakeboarding. My siblings and I are all are pretty competitive, everyone played a couple of the same sports.
In my senior year of high school, I decided not to pursue NCAA soccer and I knew I wanted to get out of California and live somewhere different for a few years. I visited Boulder and I immediately fell in love with the campus and the town, I made my decision on the spot to go to the University of Colorado.
I played club soccer there, but I thought my athletic career would end upon graduation. However, during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, I watched bobsled on TV and couldn’t believe how cool it was. “How in the world do people get into that,” I wondered. I remember the announcers saying the bobsledders came from other sports like volleyball and track and field, how did they make the switch? I literally googled “How do you get into bobsled?” and found the USA Bobsled and Skeleton homepage.
At the time I didn’t know what skeleton was, or why it was included with bobsled, so I watched it on YouTube and thought it looked like a lot of fun. When I told my brother and sister that I wanted to try it, they said there was no way I’d actually follow through. So, obviously I had to give it a shot.
The recruitment process was very informal. I found a coach’s email address on the Team USA website and sent a message asking how to try the sport. After a couple of emails, I was signed up for a combine.",6/3/17

naps-safe-pilot-sleep-tracking,Naps Keep Us Safe: Tracking the Sleep of a Commercial Airline Pilot,"“I woke up this morning in Las Vegas. We landed there around 12:30 am. By the time I got to bed it was after three. But my body is on east-coast time, so it thought it was 6 am and time for me to wake up. Falling asleep was a struggle, to say the least.” – Jason, Commercial Airline Pilot
For many elite athletes, napping plays a significant role in their training routines. Five-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady has spoken on several occasions about the value of naps. NBA All-Star DeAndre Jordan told us that he naps 5-7 times a week, and “always on game days.” Leading WHOOP athletes have also recommended taking naps as their No. 1 tip for achieving better Recoveries. But even for people who aren’t competitive athletes, naps can still be an essential part of functioning professionally in their day-to-day lives.
A few months ago, we published a story on The Locker about the effect flying a red-eye has on your body. That got us wondering, if overnight flights wreak havoc on the Sleep and Recovery of passengers, how brutal must they be for the pilots who endure them routinely?
Naps, we discovered, are the key.
We outfitted a pilot from one of the major airlines with a WHOOP Strap 2.0 to see what we we might find out. The pilot, who we’ll call Jason, gave us permission to use his data and offered to speak with us under the condition of anonymity.
“I wanted to be a pilot from the time I was a little kid, probably 4 years old,” Jason told us. “I’ve been flying professionally for nearly two decades, and you never get used to the hours. One trip you’re in the air early in the morning, the next trip you’re flying late at night. Your body is never on a normal pattern for sleep, eating, exercise, or anything else.”",7/1/17
naps-safe-pilot-sleep-tracking,Naps Keep Us Safe: Tracking the Sleep of a Commercial Airline Pilot,"“I did a lot of red-eye flights when I first started,” Jason said. “Coming back from those is torture on your body. Recovering afterwards is very, very tough. Trying to sleep in a hotel during the day is not easy. We call it a ‘day sleep’ in the industry. You have to force your body to believe it’s nighttime and sleep when it doesn’t want to sleep.”
That was the case on the day we spoke to Jason, when he’d just arrived in Las Vegas from the east coast early that morning. “My sleep latency (the amount of time it takes to fall asleep) when I got to bed this morning was 20 minutes, usually it’s just two or three,” he said. “And even after I finally fell asleep, trying to get quality rest was tough.”
A look at Jason’s Sleep data from that day confirms exactly what he told us:
He was awake for 45 minutes of the 5:58 he spent in bed, and only got eight minutes of Deep Sleep.
“Imagine how difficult it is to adjust for international pilots who travel over 12 time zones,” Jason speculated. He did inform us that flights of that length are required to have four pilots on board working in 3-4 hour shifts, with two on and two off (usually napping in between). “They also tend to have at least 48-hour layovers to recover,” he said.
Due to his seniority with the airline, Jason has a more favorable flight schedule than many other pilots. “Each month we bid for our schedules,” he told us. “We log into a website and put in our preferences. If you’re bottom of the barrell, you’re most likely going to be doing all the red-eyes and the midnight flights that nobody wants. There are also reserve pilots who are on call, like a doctor, and have to fill in when needed. In that case, you have no clue where you’re going and your phone could ring at any time. I did reserve for about three years, thankfully it was before I had a family.”",7/1/17

naps-safe-pilot-sleep-tracking,Naps Keep Us Safe: Tracking the Sleep of a Commercial Airline Pilot,"Jason has a wife and two children, ages five and three. “With kids at home it’s difficult to meet the WHOOP Sleep goals,” he said. “Most of my trips begin really early in the morning. I’m often waking up at 3 or 4 am and out the door at 4:30 am. For me to hit my recommended Sleep Need I usually have to get to bed by 7 or 8 pm, which is really hard to do.”
“On the road, I can make my hotel rooms quiet, dark and cool. I’ve actually noticed a lot of higher Recoveries in the Green on the way back from trips, as opposed to starting trips when I’m usually in the Yellow. If you talk to pilots that have young kids at home and ask ‘What do you do on the road? Do you hit the tables when you’re in Vegas? Do you go sailing in San Diego?’ They’ll say ‘No dude, I sleep!’”
We asked Jason to describe one of his more trying flight experiences since he’s be wearing the WHOOP Strap:
“There was a red-eye flight from the northeast to the caribbean last month. We’d been delayed for about two-and-a-half hours and didn’t take off until after midnight. My fellow pilot and I were both a little frustrated about the delay and we were not looking forward to landing at 4 am and following it up with a ‘day sleep’ before our next flight assignment later that night. That day ‘sucked’ for lack of a better term.”
However, Jason’s WHOOP data indicates that he actually handled the situation extremely well:
He slept 8:20 the night before, getting 100% of his Sleep Need with an 89% Recovery. Jason then napped for 1:49 that afternoon in anticipation of his overnight flight, reducing his Sleep Need for the next day. Upon arriving in the caribbean, he got to bed at 4:55 am, then awoke at 10:30 am. He slept for 5:16 of the 5:35 he spent in bed, and because his nap the previous afternoon had reduced his Sleep Need to 6:05, he still managed to log an 87% Sleep Performance and was 74% Recovered for his flight that evening.",7/1/17
naps-safe-pilot-sleep-tracking,Naps Keep Us Safe: Tracking the Sleep of a Commercial Airline Pilot,"“WHOOP has made me realize that naps are golden,” Jason told us. “If I get lucky I can nap at home when my three-year old does. On the road, getting an hour or two in does wonders, it makes it possible to meet my sleep need that night.”
Jason explained that pilots are responsible for telling the airlines whenever they believe they are too fatigued to fly: “You have to know your own body. The FAA says that you, the pilot, must determine if you’re fit for duty. You have to ask yourself that question before every flight. You’re legally required to remove yourself if you’re not fit. I’ve called in fatigued before. When you do, you’re totally protected.”
Armed with WHOOP, fatigue hasn’t been an issue for Jason. Over a recent one-month span that included both overnight flights discussed, as well as multiple other red-eyes, Jason was able to average 71% daily Recoveries and a 91% Sleep Performance:
How did he do it? Jason’s work schedule listed 14 flights in those 30 days. His WHOOP data shows 15 naps in that time, including one either before or after each day he travelled. “I’ve started making more of an effort to nap since using WHOOP,” he added. “The difference that makes in my next-day Recovery is eye-opening.”
“The FAA and the airlines are doing their best to make schedules as gentle as possible. But, we’re humans flying, not robots,” Jason said. “We could be short on sleep or have other stressors in our lives, just like anybody else that shows up for a 9-5 job. We just happen to be in charge of upwards of a couple hundred lives. No major U.S. airline has had an accident since November of 2001. The industry is so safe right now, the training and the technology has made leaps and bounds.”

They examined the relationship between WHOOP Recovery and the players’ field-goal and free-throw percentages. What they found was startling:
“A 50% difference in Recovery predicted roughly a 35% difference in field-goal percentage in relation to each player’s season average. The correlation was even greater for foul shooting, where a 50% difference in Recovery suggested a 50% difference in free-throw accuracy. What does this mean? Instead of knocking down both free throws each time he goes to the line, a star player might only sink one of two if he isn’t properly recovered.”

A perennial college basketball powerhouse, Duke closed out the 2016-17 regular season ranked seventh nationally. The Blue Devils then reloaded by bringing in four of the top eight incoming freshman in the country. They topped the preseason polls and have yet to relinquish their No. 1 ranking, defeating their first 11 opponents by an average of 20.3 points per game. Duke is well on its way to qualifying for the NCAA Tournament for a 23rd consecutive year.
Boston College is on the climb in the ACC, arguably the toughest and most talented conference in college basketball history. Boasting one of the best backcourts in the country, the Eagles have a mix of high-scoring veterans and talented newcomers poised for a breakthrough in 2017-18. Saturday, BC looks to knock off Duke for the first time since 2009.
With WHOOP, the Eagles are taking a step in the right direction towards joining the ranks of the college basketball elite.

naturally-improve-immune-system,How to Make Your Immune System Stronger,"## How to Improve Immune System Naturally
An easy way to help prevent yourself from getting sick is to do everything you can to ensure you have a strong immune system. Below we’ll give a quick summary of how the immune system works, and share a few tips for what you can do to improve it–most notably, sleep.
## Immune System Overview & Why it’s Important to Have a Strong One
Your immune system is what defends your body against germs and infections to keep you from becoming ill. When foreign substances (known as antigens) attack, your immune system is activated.
White blood cells (also called leukocytes) are the most critical component of the immune system. It uses two main types of white blood cells to fend off antigens:
1. Phagocytes – These are cells that break down or “eat” invading cells.
2. Lymphocytes – These cells allow your body to remember antigens that have attacked previously and recognize them when they return in the future.
A strong immune system is essential for staying healthy. When it’s weakened, you become more susceptible to viruses, bacteria, parasites, toxins and more.",3/23/20
naturally-improve-immune-system,How to Make Your Immune System Stronger,"Strengthen Immune System with Sleep
Getting all the sleep you need is the one of the best things you can do to improve your immune system. When you are asleep, your body works to repair vital systems. If you don’t get enough sleep each night (in particular the restorative stages, deep sleep and REM sleep), your body will not properly recover and you are more likely to get sick.
Studies have shown that people who sleep 6 hours a night or less are significantly more likely to catch a common virus than those who sleep 7 hours or more. Other research has demonstrated that reduced energy demands during sleep allow your body to allocate more resources during that time towards the immune system. There’s also data indicating that T cells (lymphocytes that fight viruses) are more effective when you’re sleeping.

## Additional Ways to Improve Immunity
Other things you can do to benefit your immune system beyond getting more sleep at night include:
## Track Sleep and Immune System Boosting Behaviors with WHOOP
A recent study from the University of Arizona proved that WHOOP is able to accurately measure sleep and identify the various stages of sleep. Additionally, the WHOOP Sleep Planner tells you exactly how much sleep you need each night, as well as the optimal times to go to bed and wake up to maintain a healthy circadian rhythm.
WHOOP members can also use the new Journal feature to track a wide and customizable list of potential immune-system-improving behaviors in order to understand what drives their green recoveries and better overall health.

nba-rule-change-a-win-for-athletes-careers,NBA Rule Change a Win for Athletes' Careers?,"There’s a little-known rule in the NBA that prohibits teams from signing a player to a four or five-year contract if he’s going to turn 36 during the time of the deal. It was put in place to prevent clubs from offering guys more money than the salary cap permits by paying them for seasons when they would likely already be retired, with 36 deemed the age by which players were assumed to be out of the league.
That rule is about to change, thanks in large part to LeBron James. Now in his 14th season, James is 31 years old, with his 32nd birthday coming in December. The way things currently stand, LeBron would be unable to sign a new five-year max contract next summer since he’d be 37 by the time it expired. Is there anyone on the planet who actually doubts James will still be going strong at age 37?
LeBron is the superstar of all superstars, and his influence with the Players Association (NBPA) is prompting the number to jump from 36 to 38 in the league’s new collective bargaining agreement, which is expected to be announced later this year. Other big-name veterans, like 31-year-old NBPA President Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony, 32, also stand to benefit.
While on the surface it seems quite clear that “King James” is the driving force behind this rule change, it makes sense from a big-picture standpoint as well. To paraphrase the great Jay-Z (sort of), when it comes to NBA stars, 38 is the new 36. The league is acknowledging the fact that its players are capable of remaining at or near the top of their game at a more advanced age than ever before.
Today’s pros have access to information and technology that was never previously available. A few decades ago, superstars like Michael Jordan and Larry Bird drank beer regularly during the season. Now we have empirical evidence that suggests it may take as long as four days to recover from a single night of drinking. Imagine what Jordan and Bird might have accomplished over the course of their careers had they known this?",11/1/16
nba-rule-change-a-win-for-athletes-careers,NBA Rule Change a Win for Athletes' Careers?,"World-class athletes are now infinitely more aware of what’s going on with their bodies. They eat better, train smarter, sleep more efficiently and do everything possible to perform at the highest level.
Many NBA players, James included, hire their own personal chefs in order to ensure they are eating properly. Veteran forward Paul Pierce used to put down fast food burgers and cola before games. Those days are long behind him. The 39-year-old now follows a careful diet and drinks almost exclusively water. Pierce also swears by the benefits of a hyperbaric chamber, which was introduced to him by long-time friend and former teammate Kevin Garnett, who just retired from the league at age 40 after 21 seasons.
Technology is at the forefront of extending NBA players’ careers, and WHOOP has the potential to play a key role.
The 24/7 analysis WHOOP provides allows athletes to have a much greater understanding of their Sleep, Strain and Recovery. For aging players looking to remain competitive with guys close to half their age, optimal Sleep goes a long way. In fact, WHOOP even has real data to show basketball players’ shooting percentages increase when they have higher Recovery scores.
Players also become more susceptible to injury the older they get–Kobe Bryant is a perfect example. Bryant retired last spring at age 37, but he took the floor for only 107 out of a possible 246 games over his final three seasons due to shoulder, knee and Achilles injuries.
Data indicates athletes using WHOOP reported injuries 60-percent less often. Might WHOOP have been able to help Kobe spend less time on the sidelines during the twilight of his career?
The NBA’s “over 36 rule” changing to 38 is a clear sign of players’ ability to last longer in the league than ever before. And who knows, maybe WHOOP will help bump that number even higher in the years to come.",11/1/16

It may not appear to be headed in the right direction, but the text at the top of the screen points out a decrease in average RHR, a sign that overall fitness is improving:
We anticipate users will find great value in their weekly trends when looking at their Sleep consistency. A recent Harvard University study discovered that students who followed a regular sleep schedule performed better academically than those who did not. Getting enough sleep is obviously very important, but so is getting the right sleep. Viewing your time in bed each day is a great way to help develop consistent Sleep patterns throughout the week:
This trend view can also enable you to modify your behavior to improve your Sleep overall. In the example above, the user could look back at what they did on Wednesday and determine what to do differently in the future in oder to to get to bed at the regular time.

new-app-feature-advanced-weekly-trends,WHOOP Introduces Our New Fitness Tracker App Feature,"As we strive to enhance the WHOOP user experience, we’re continually building new features to add to the system. Last month, we released Activity Auto-Detection, which can automatically log your workouts for you in the WHOOP app. Today, we’re proud to announce another new feature available in the app: Advanced Weekly Trends.
In addition to being able to view and compare week-long trends for your Strain, Sleep, and Recovery, you can now take a more in-depth look at trends for each of the following: Daily average heart rate, resting heart rate (RHR), heart rate variability (HRV), calories burned, time in bed, and time asleep vs. Sleep Need.
Here’s how it works:
For the time being, this feature is available for iOS only. However, Android users (and iOS users as well) have full access to all of these trends (and more!) on the web version of our app–simply visit app.whoop.com and log in to your account.
What are the Benefits?
The overview trend that plots daily Strain and Recovery is a simple indicator of your ability to optimize training for the week. For example, in the screenshot below the user missed an opportunity to train hard and take advantage of a high Recovery on Monday, but then did an outstanding job balancing Strain and Recovery for the rest of the week:
If your intention is to functionally overreach with your training for a period of time (with multiple high-Strain days and likely low Recoveries), or possibly taper (reducing Strain to boost Recoveries) before a big race or competition, this trend view lets you easily see how you’re doing.
The weekly HRV trend is a useful tool to put your daily HRV in perspective. Low HRV on any given day is not necessarily a cause for concern, it’s normal for it to fluctuate. However, a downward trend over several days may be an indication that your body needs to rest:",11/8/17

new-feature-sleep-consistency-why-we-track-it,Sleep Consistency: Why We Track it and How Do You Compare?,"WHAT’S NORMAL?
People ask us all the time if their data is “good” or “normal,” and how they stack up against other WHOOP users. To help answer this question, we pulled Sleep Consistency values from the month of January for 25,000 WHOOP users and plotted them in the histogram shown below.
The average Sleep Consistency value across all users on WHOOP is a shockingly low 67.9%. We find this particularly surprising because WHOOP users love their sleep–they get an average of 7.6 hours per night for an average Sleep Performance of 82.8%. This means that while WHOOP users are generally making a good effort to get enough sleep, they aren’t yet doing it optimally.
Since we are glass-half-full kind of people, we think this is great news since is means there is a simple and effective path to improvement.
Before we get into all the exciting correlations we found between various measures of sleep quality and Sleep Consistency, we first want to show you that not all subpopulations on WHOOP are doing equally poorly. Some of you are actually nailing your Sleep Consistency, while others have more opportunity to improve.
When divided into different age cohorts roughly by decade, we observe that sleep consistency gets better as WHOOP users get older. The increase is roughly one percentage point per decade, with the biggest improvements made as users leave their potentially rowdy 20s behind them for the likely more stable and responsible 30s.
When we further broke down our age cohorts by gender, we observed that females are more consistent sleepers across the board. The higher commitment to consistent sleep timing seems to be paying off. In addition to having significantly higher Sleep Consistency than males, females also have a much better average Sleep Performance–85.8% compared to 81.5%.",3/4/19
new-feature-sleep-consistency-why-we-track-it,Sleep Consistency: Why We Track it and How Do You Compare?,"SLEEP CONSISTENCY TEMPORAL PATTERNS
Similarly to what we reported on with Sleep Efficiency, Sleep Consistency exhibited a robust cyclical behavior which broke down over Thanksgiving weekend and again during the holiday season from the end of December through New Years.
We found that the cyclic nature of WHOOP Sleep Consistency almost directly aligned with the weeks of the year. This phenomenon can be better visualized when data is binned by day of week.
### WHY CARE?
Here comes the meaty part – if you’re on WHOOP, you probably have a pretty good sense of your Sleep Consistency from your Weekly Performance Assessments (WHOOP members can jump to theirs here). And now that you have an understanding of how you measure up to the rest of the WHOOP population, you’re probably wondering what you can do to get better.
### MORE SLEEP!
We mentioned above that females, who on average have higher Sleep Consistency than males, are also getting more sleep. Well, it turns out that this is also true on an individual level. WHOOP users who sleep more consistently are also sleeping more overall. In fact, our most consistent sleepers (those averaging Sleep Consistencies above 80%) are getting roughly 1.25 hours more sleep per night than are our least consistent sleepers (those averaging Sleep Consistencies below 50%).
The relationship between Sleep Consistency and Duration is further detailed in the graph below.",3/4/19
new-feature-sleep-consistency-why-we-track-it,Sleep Consistency: Why We Track it and How Do You Compare?,"The importance of Sleep Consistency is something we’ve been talking about for a long time. It’s highlighted in your weekly performance assessment and used to bring you more intelligent Sleep Need push notifications, and you can also track it each day alongside the rest of your sleep metrics.
### WHAT IS SLEEP CONSISTENCY?
Sleep Consistency quantifies how similar your sleep and wake times are over a 4-day period. Scored on a 0-100% scale, higher Sleep Consistency indicates more similar bed and wake times, while lower Sleep Consistency indicates greater variability in night-to-night sleep timing.
In the space below, we break down the Sleep Consistency of various WHOOP subpopulations and dig into what our data shows you can expect if you improve your own Sleep Consistency.",3/4/19
new-feature-sleep-consistency-why-we-track-it,Sleep Consistency: Why We Track it and How Do You Compare?,"BETTER SLEEP!
Not only are highly consistent sleepers getting more sleep, they are getting better sleep too! Our most consistent sleepers have higher Sleep Efficiency, and get more SWS and REM Sleep (Note: throughout the images that follow we cut off the graphs for Sleep Consistencies below 48% and above 85% because so few users averaged values in those ranges that the resulting analysis was not statistically significant).
Sleep Consistency explains up to a 3% difference in Sleep Efficiency. For those of you who are motivated to sleep more efficiently after reading last week’s post, this data suggests that sleeping more consistently is a great place to start.
Slow Wave Sleep (also known as deep sleep) is primarily characterized by physical recovery. Sleep Consistency can explain about a 15-minute difference in Slow Wave Sleep per night. While this is an exciting difference, the impact of increasing Sleep Consistency on REM sleep is even greater. As shown in the graph below, Sleep Consistency explains up to a 36-minute difference in nightly average REM sleep, the phase of sleep in which mental recovery occurs.

Additionally, we asked them to rank the importance of “maintaining a consistent bedtime” on a scale of 1-7.

Hasselbeck speculated on the direction it might be headed for the fans watching on TV, saying “Imagine how cool it would be to see [NFL kicker] Adam Vinatieri’s heart rate as he lined up for a game-winning kick?”
Springs wondered about regulating the ownership of the data (“Can the team use it against me?”), an issue the NBA’s most recent collective bargaining agreement is attempting to address. Hasselbeck also suggested that new performance technology is particularly intriguing to aging pro athletes, noting “as you get older, availability is job security.” He cited Tom Brady as an example, saying “we wonder why he’s playing his best football at a time when most people should be done with their career.”
Fitzpatrick questioned if it might take longer than it should for the NFL’s teams and players to accept wearables into the sport, mentioning that “coaches hate change.” DeOssie agreed, but pointed out that the next generation of athletes will likely spur the transition if wearables become the norm on the youth level.

“Am I prepared for this particular training session in front of me? … That starts with Recovery. Now I’m getting that data. It’s the most intricate that I’ve had.”
Dr. Charlene Mello, chief scientist at the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, spoke in regards to military applications of wearables for the “tactical athlete.” “Special forces have performance metrics that compare to elite athletes … but they don’t have the same comforts of daily life,” she said. “They’re often sleep deprived with tremendous load.” Mello also raised the question “How much do we consider the [wearable device’s] data when making critical decisions?”
When the topic turned to the software that’s changing how we analyze performance, Ahmed discussed the importance of tracking what athletes are doing when they’re not training, as well as how WHOOP uses heart rate variability (HRV) to calculate daily Recovery:
“What gets us really excited–what can you do to perform at a higher level during the other 20 hours a day? … Our recovery is now correlating with all sorts of different performance metrics; if you have a higher recovery in the morning you’re more likely to shoot better free throws in basketball, or run a faster time trial, or swim faster laps.

Isn’t this really all you need? And it’s not just the blaring noise of old-fashioned alarm clocks–even a carefully selected cell phone melody can become extremely intolerable as well. For example, what happens when a person near you has the same ringtone on their phone that you’ve chosen for your alarm?
“Hearing the alarm you use to wake up in the morning coming out of someone else’s phone at another time of day is among the banal terrors of modern life.” – Maureen O’Connor of The Cut

noah-ohlsen-data-crossfit-games-atalanta,Noah Ohlsen’s Biometric Data from CrossFit Games & Hardest Workout Ever,"With the 2021 CrossFit Games getting underway, we take a look back at last year’s Games and the performance of one of the sport’s top athletes, Noah Ohlsen. In particular, we break down Noah’s WHOOP data and the impact of Atalanta, dubbed the most difficult workout in the history of the Games.
## Primed to Perform: Recovery and HRV Peaking
On October 22, the day before the finals of the 2020 CrossFit Games began, Noah Ohlsen’s heart rate variability (HRV) was 141 milliseconds, a fantastic number relative to his baseline and a great sign that his body was ready to perform. HRV is a major component of the WHOOP recovery metric, an indication (from 0-100%) of how prepared your body is to take on strain. Noah’s recovery that morning was 99%.
His 3-day trends for HRV (75 ms, 105 ms, 141 ms), resting heart rate (45 bpm, 44 bpm, 42 bpm) and recovery (43%, 76%, 99%) were all headed in the right direction.
Noah also did an excellent job balancing his daily WHOOP strain (a measure of cardiovascular exertion on a 0-21 scale) and recovery leading up to the Games. Keeping his strain on par with what his body could handle each day allowed for him to be in peak physical condition prior to competing against the fittest on Earth.
Noah’s daily strain (blue) fell in line with or below his daily recovery (yellow/green) in the week leading up to the Games, culminating in a recovery of 99%.",7/7/21
noah-ohlsen-data-crossfit-games-atalanta,Noah Ohlsen’s Biometric Data from CrossFit Games & Hardest Workout Ever,"“I ended up being the first one to start that final mile. I remember thinking, ‘Holy smokes, I’m rocked right now.’ Unfortunately this is the part that’s really going to eat at me forever. When I was about 800 meters into the run, all the muscles in my lower body were right on the verge of cramping. I could barely keep one foot moving in front of the other and I was more shuffling my feet than running. I felt like I had the physical capacity to run, but if I went any faster my legs were going to fully cramp and I was going to fall over. As much as I hated to do it, I took a few steps just walking while watching Mat Fraser slowly distance himself in front of me.”
Noah needed to win the Atalanta workout to land on the podium and place third overall at the Games. “Even knowing that, struggling inside, screaming at myself to run faster, I physically just couldn’t get my body to do it,” he said.",7/7/21

The night before Day 1 of the Games, Noah got 100% of the sleep his body needed. He also had a very solid 3 hours and 46 minutes of restorative sleep (time spent in REM and deep sleep).
Being fully rested and properly recovered was essential, as the first day of the Games was incredibly challenging. Noah competed in five events, leading to an overall day strain of 20.5. Below is a graphic displaying his heart rate for the entire day:
Noah’s heart rate Spanning Day 1 of the Games, with the most strenuous moments highlighted.
His HR peaked at 179 beats per minute at the end of the final workout of the day, the Ranch Loop. It was announced as a 3-mile run across varying terrain, but upon reaching the finish line the athletes were told they had to run a second lap.
The immense strain of Day 1 absolutely crushed Noah’s recovery for Day 2, which was just 6%. “I remember waking up that morning and opening the [WHOOP] app,” Noah said. “I shook my phone and said ‘It must be broken, right?’ It was just a beatdown of a day, physically and emotionally.” His HRV also fell all the way down to 50, and his RHR jumped to 59.
Another four events led to a 17.8 strain for Noah on the second day of the Games.",7/7/21
noah-ohlsen-data-crossfit-games-atalanta,Noah Ohlsen’s Biometric Data from CrossFit Games & Hardest Workout Ever,"Atalanta Heart Rate Data
The last day featured three more grueling workouts, concluding with one deemed the hardest ever at the Games–Atalanta. It consisted of:
a 1-mile run
100 handstand push-ups
200 single-leg squats or “pistols”
300 pull-ups
another 1-mile run
All while wearing a 20-pound vest.
When Noah and the other Games athletes learned of the absurd task that was about to be asked of them, he thought to himself “I’m just going to do what I can with what I’ve got.”
He ended up placing second in the event, finishing with a time of 52 minutes and 25 seconds. You can clearly see the effect the various activities had on his body by viewing his real-time heart rate data:
Noah’s HR metrics for Atalanta, the most difficult CrossFit Games workout ever.
Noah’s HR immediately rose to around 150 bpm as the first run began, then elevated higher as he neared the end. It spiked again during the handstand pushups, and went up even more as he executed the single-leg squats.
“I tried to move pretty quickly on the pistols,” he told us, “I knew I could make up some ground. Somewhere in the middle I felt a pop in my calf near my achilles. I remember thinking ‘That is not good.’ I did a rep on it to test it and make sure I could continue.”
Luckily Noah was able to keep going, and he performed spectacularly on the pull-ups. His HR actually dipped to its lowest point during the event (yet still above 125) as he took the lead heading into the last leg.",7/7/21
noah-ohlsen-data-crossfit-games-atalanta,Noah Ohlsen’s Biometric Data from CrossFit Games & Hardest Workout Ever,"Recovery Back to Green
Atalanta, the Games’ last event, logged an activity strain of 16.0 over the 52+ minutes Noah was competing. The morning afterwards, his recovery was only 4%, in the red for a third straight day.
Following the massive stress his body took on over the course of the Games, Noah’s HRV dropped even further to 42, and his RHR climbed again to 63. Desperately in need of rest, Noah gave his body exactly what it wanted. He kept his strain below 8.0 for the next three days, which was precisely how long it took to get his recovery back into the green.",7/7/21
noah-ohlsen-talks-crossfit-open-workout-22-1,Noah Ohlsen Talks CrossFit Open & Workout 22.1,"After Tia-Claire [Toomey-Orr] told us virtually what we’d be getting into, we had about five minutes to wrap our heads around the movements, rep scheme and time frame, and to come up with a strategy on our own. Then it was 3, 2, 1, go!
It may sound silly, but a 15-minute workout can actually feel long when it comes to repeating quick simple movements like wall walks, dumbbell snatches and box jump overs, over and over again. I could feel the positive momentum of an early lead over Pat and was still feeling pretty good just past the halfway point.
Around the 10-minute mark, a bit of fatigue started to creep in. By the time we had three minutes to go that felt like an eternity, and I was running on fumes at that point. It was a bit of a bummer not being able to hold on, as Pat managed to sneak on by with just a minute left. Regardless of how I felt in that moment, I congratulated Pat and made it a point to walk around and high five as many fans as I could, thanking them for their enthusiastic encouragement.
Noah’s strain hit 13.2 and his heart rate peaked at 163 bpm during his 22.1 workout.
We wrapped up with a post-event podcast as a crew and had the rest of the day to explore Boulder, celebrating the start of what I hope will be my 9th consecutive season as a CrossFit Games athlete. I felt overwhelmed with gratitude for everything this sport has given me over the last decade, for the friends and family that have supported me through it all, and for the exciting possibilities this season has in store!

Looking at the announcement as more of a fun show for the people was a sigh of relief, and a stark contrast to the typical tension that comes with a high-stakes competition. That was directly reflected in my WHOOP data, as I woke up in the green the first two mornings we were there!
I was worried that the altitude might have had an impact on my body, but I don’t think I felt much of anything as we moved around those first couple of days. Granted, I was doing everything recommended by my nutritionist, Mike Molloy, to fend off any ill effects (hydrating, abstaining from caffeine, and increasing potassium, carbs and overall calories).
A solid night’s sleep helped Noah post a 77% WHOOP recovery on the morning of his open workout 22.1.

It also shifted the lens through which I’d view the workout, allowing me to see it as an exhibition, rather than a competition. We were headed there to put on a show.

normal-hrv-range-age-gender,Normal Heart Rate Variability: Average HRV Range by Age and Gender,"## Understanding Normal Heart Rate Variability
Heart rate variability (HRV), which is regulated by your autonomic nervous system, is very useful for evaluating physical fitness and your body’s readiness to perform. Measured in milliseconds (ms), HRV is literally the difference in time between beats of your heart.
If heart rate variability is something you’re not already familiar with, check out our Ultimate Guide to HRV to better understand what it is and why it’s so meaningful.
Broadly speaking, higher HRV is usually an indication of better fitness. However, one of the most important things to realize with heart rate variability is that it is an extremely individualized metric that often differs significantly from one person to another. It can also fluctuate considerably on a day-to-day basis (and throughout the day).
## Healthy Heart Rate Variability
If your goal is to determine what is a normal or “healthy” HRV for you, there are many factors that come into play. Age, gender, lifestyle, fitness level, genetics, and even your environment all have an effect on your heart rate variability.
In general, HRV tends to decrease with age, and males have slightly higher HRV on average than females. Athletes usually have greater heart rate variability than non-athletes, but this is not always the case. There are plenty of people out there who are in outstanding shape but have HRV that’s below the norm.",1/20/21
normal-hrv-range-age-gender,Normal Heart Rate Variability: Average HRV Range by Age and Gender,"Average HRV Chart by Age and Gender
Across everyone on WHOOP, the average heart rate variability for men is 65, and for women it’s 62. Elaborating on that, a frequently posed question is “What is the normal range for HRV?”
Below is a chart displaying the middle 50% of all HRV values for male and female WHOOP members between the ages of 20 and 65:
You can see above that the normal HRV range clearly declines for both men and women as they get older. For example, the middle half of 25-year-old males fall roughly from 50-100, while 45-year-olds are around 35-60. Females of the same ages see a similar dip, from about 45-90 to 30-55.
## HRV Range for Men
It’s worth noting that a small percentage of the WHOOP population skews the averages upwards to some degree. There are people (often elite athletes) who have extraordinarily high heart rate variability that’s much greater than what is typical. But, the opposite is not the case. The lowest HRV numbers we see are not that far below the standard.
Take a look at the distribution of all heart rate variability scores for males:
While there are some who average 160 and above (and occasionally even break 200), nobody really lands much below 15 or so. This chart shows that the most common HRV for men is right around 40.
## HRV Range for Women
The same is true for females as well:
As demonstrated by the graphic above, the most frequent HRV score for women is 37.",1/20/21
normal-hrv-range-age-gender,Normal Heart Rate Variability: Average HRV Range by Age and Gender,"Track Heart Rate Variability with WHOOP
Since HRV varies widely from person to person, rather than compare yourself to others it makes much more sense to follow your own trends over time.
As you make efforts to improve your overall health and fitness, you’ll likely see a corresponding increase in your heart rate variability. Conversely, a downward trend may be a sign of overtraining or other unhealthy behaviors (bad nutrition, poor sleep, etc).
WHOOP tracks HRV using a dynamic average during your sleep every night. Emphasis is placed on your deepest periods of sleep in order to best provide you with a consistent and accurate understanding of what your baseline is. Each morning, WHOOP uses heart rate variability (along with sleep, resting heart rate and respiratory rate) to calculate your recovery–how ready your body is to perform that day.
The WHOOP app also gives you actionable insights based on your daily HRV scores, as well weekly trend views. Additionally, WHOOP members receive Monthly Performance Assessments featuring detailed long-term analysis of their heart rate variability.

Heart rates fluctuate constantly and increase when you are active, so accurately monitoring your resting heart rate manually can be quite difficult (particularly if you want a consistent reading every day to compare over time).
WHOOP measures RHR while your body is in its most restful state during your deepest period of sleep each night, allowing for extremely controlled and reliable readings. The WHOOP app also tracks your trends in resting heart rate, and as your fitness improves you’ll likely see it begin to decrease.
Additionally, WHOOP uses resting heart rate (as well as heart rate variability, respiratory rate and sleep performance) to calculate a daily recovery for you each morning–a metric for how “ready to go” your body is that day and how prepared you are to take on strain.

Normal resting heart rate for women increases slightly with age, and is also generally a few BPM higher than the average for men.
The graphic above shows the average resting heart rate of female and male WHOOP members ages 20-50. As you can clearly see, women normally have a slightly higher RHR than men do (more on that to follow).
There is also usually a minor increase in RHR with age between a person’s 20s and 50s (our data shows that after age 50 it tends to level off). The normal bpm for women in their 20s is about 58, but by their 40s it’s closer to 60.
## How Pregnancy Affects Heart Rate
It is normal for a women’s resting heart rate to rise during pregnancy, roughly 10-20 bpm on average. The act of carrying a growing baby inside of you in an added stressor throughout the body, including to your heart and circulatory system.
Total blood volume also increases by anywhere from 30-50% when a woman is pregnant in order to nourish the baby.

## Lower Resting Heart Rate Indicates Better Health & Fitness
In the most basic terms, “When your heart rate goes down, it means that each beat is more effective” (WHOOP Podcast 29: HRV). A low resting heart rate is a sign of a strong heart muscle (as well as good heart health and reduced risk of heart disease) that can pump out greater amounts of blood with every beat and not have to beat as often.
Your health and physical fitness is directly linked to the strength of your heart. When it doesn’t need to work as hard to push blood through your body to supply oxygen to your muscles, your level of fitness increases.

RHR can be a very useful metric for measuring your fitness level and tracking your overall health. For the most part, you want your resting heart rate to be lower as opposed to higher.
We’ll take a look at what is a healthy resting heart rate for women, what’s average or can be considered “normal,” and also break it down by age. Additionally, we’ll discuss how RHR is a barometer of your physical fitness, plus the best way to track it.
## Normal Resting Heart Rate for Women
According to the American Heart Association, a typical resting heart heart rate for anyone is usually between 60 and 100 bpm. This number can fall closer to 40 bpm for those who are quite active and in excellent shape.
Among people who wear WHOOP, the average resting heart rate for women is 58.8 bpm.
Generally speaking, WHOOP members tend to be fairly physically active and interested in monitoring their overall health and well-being. So if you’re curious about what is a good resting heart rate for women, that average of 58.8 is a reasonable number to keep in mind.
## Why Do Women Have Higher Heart Rates Than Men?
Surprisingly, the answer is actually quite simple. The size of women’s hearts are typically a bit smaller than men’s, in turn affecting heart rate. Each heart beat produces less blood flow, so they need to pump faster in order to achieve the same output.
WHOOP data shows this translates to a difference of about 3.5 bpm on average.

normal-resting-heart-rate-improve-fitness,"Resting Heart Rate: What’s Normal, Why It’s a Sign of Fitness, How to Improve It","Why a Low Resting Heart Rate is a Sign of Fitness
To put it simply, “When your heart rate goes down, it means that each heart beat is more effective” (Podcast 29: HRV). A low resting heart rate is an indication of a strong heart muscle that can pump out a greater amount of blood with every beat so it does not have to beat as frequently.
Your physical fitness is directly correlated to the strength of your heart. When your heart is in better condition and doesn’t need to work as hard to push blood throughout the body and deliver oxygen to your muscles, your fitness improves.
## What Does a High Resting Heart Rate Mean?
Just as a low RHR is a sign of a stronger heart, a high resting heart rate may signify a weaker heart muscle. Research indicates that in the long-term, an elevated RHR likely adds to the risk of mortality.
In the short-term, the following factors can increase resting heart rate:
Strenuous exercise or overtraining
Stress and anxiety
Sleep deprivation and fatigue
Dehydration
Caffeine or alcohol consumption
Smoking cigarettes or use of certain drugs
Illness or underlying health conditions
Medication side effects
However, having an above-average resting heart rate compared to others is not necessarily a cause for concern. A recent study showed that normal RHR from one individual to the next may vary by as much as 70 bpm.",5/8/20
normal-resting-heart-rate-improve-fitness,"Resting Heart Rate: What’s Normal, Why It’s a Sign of Fitness, How to Improve It","How to Improve Resting Heart Rate
By far, the No. 1 thing to do for lowering resting heart rate is exercise. In particular, aerobic exercise like running or cycling (activities you can sustain for long periods of time at 70-80% of your max heart rate) will assist you in building cardiovascular strength.
Additionally, each of the behaviors below can help you decrease your RHR:
Getting all the sleep you need and improving the quality and consistency of your sleep
Following a balanced diet with proper nutrition
Hydrating sufficiently
Avoiding alcohol
Limiting stimulants like caffeine and nicotine
Taking warm, calming showers or baths
Going for walks outside, ideally in nature
Relaxation exercises like guided breathing, meditation, stretching or yoga
In general, anything you can do to reduce stress and manage anxiety will benefit your resting heart rate.
## Track and Measure Resting Heart Rate with WHOOP
Your heart rate fluctuates constantly and increases with activity, so accurately monitoring RHR on your own can be quite difficult (especially if you’re looking to get a consistent reading every day and compare them over time).
WHOOP measures your resting heart rate each night using a dynamic average weighted towards your last period of slow wave sleep, when your body is in its most restful state. This allows for as controlled and reliable a reading as possible. You can track your resting heart rate trends in the app, and note behaviors that may impact your RHR in the journal feature.
Additionally, WHOOP uses your resting heart rate (along with heart rate variability, respiratory rate and sleep performance) to calculate your recovery each morning–almost like a daily weather forecast for your body.

Below we’ll examine what is a healthy resting heart rate for men and women, what’s average or “normal” for both, and break it down by age. We’ll also discuss why RHR is an indicator of your physical fitness, what you can do to improve it, plus the most reliable and effective way to track it.
## Normal Resting Heart Rate
The American Heart Association states that a normal resting heart rate is usually between 60 and 100 beats per minute. However, for athletes and people who are active, this number may dip closer to 40 bpm.
It’s also worth noting that the average resting heart rate for women tends to be a bit higher than for men. This is because females typically have slightly smaller hearts, which in turn produce less blood flow with each beat and must pump faster to reach the same output.
Additionally, there is often a slight increase in RHR with age.
## Average Resting Heart Rate Chart For Men & Women
What is a good resting heart rate by age and gender? The graphic below depicts the average resting heart rate by age for male and female WHOOP members between 20 and 50 years old.
the average resting heart rate for men wearing WHOOP is 55.2 bpm, and for women it’s 58.8 bpm.
Across all ages, the average resting heart rate for women wearing WHOOP is 58.8 bpm, and for men it’s 55.2 bpm.
Given that our members tend to be athletes and/or people who are particularly interested in monitoring their health and well-being, it’s no surprise that the normal resting heart rate for men and women on WHOOP is below what the AHA considers average.",5/8/20

olympic-swimmer-kira-toussaint-shares-whoop-data-training-world-championships,How Olympic Swimmer Kira Toussaint Uses WHOOP Data to Train for World Championships,"When we last spoke to Kira in late June, she’d just traveled to Rome for a series of preparatory meets prior to the World Championships.
“The day before we traveled was a hard race day, so yesterday my Recovery was very low,” she said (28%). “But then I rested, took a nap during the flight and went to bed early, so my Recovery was high today. Last night when we arrived we went to the pool and did some mobility exercises on land. Then we went into water and swam 1k, which only takes 20-25 minutes just to loosen up–really easy and slow to prepare our bodies for today. This morning we had an easy aerobic practice, 3.2k to focus on technique. We’re about to do some light lifting in the weight room, 30-35 minutes. Just light maintenance since we’re in the racing phase of the season.”
Kira’s WHOOP data from that day tells the same story–a 94% Recovery and an 88% Sleep performance the night before. She also logged her workouts that morning and afternoon (where her heart rate spikes in blue):
In July, Kira and the Dutch national team have been training in Gyor, Hungary, about 75 miles from Budapest. Although they are training as a team, workout plans vary widely for each swimmer.

A post shared by Kira Toussaint (@kiratoussaint) on Jul 10, 2017 at 4:57am PDT
“We all do different sets,” Kira said. “Usually you do a set with one other person and you rarely swim alone, but our training is very individualized. For example, I’m a sprinter, I’m not as talented in my aerobic capacity. The coaches know that I can’t handle as much work as somebody with very high aerobic capacities.”
As Kira mentioned, her heart rate variability continues to trend in the right direction:
The dramatic increase in her average HRV over the past few months is a great sign that she’s doing everything right to peak at World Championships.",7/21/17
olympic-swimmer-kira-toussaint-shares-whoop-data-training-world-championships,How Olympic Swimmer Kira Toussaint Uses WHOOP Data to Train for World Championships,"To say Kira Toussaint was born with a swimming background is an understatement. Her mother, Jolanda de Rover, won a gold medal for the Netherlands in the 200-meter backstroke in the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. Kira’s, father, Huub Toussaint, is a swimmer and wetsuit designer with a PHD in the mechanics and energetics of swimming. However, Kira insists it was her choice to follow in her mother’s footsteps.
“My sister Merel and I always tried a lot of different sports growing up,” she told WHOOP. “My mom didn’t want to force us into swimming. I wasn’t very good at any land sports though, and I really liked swimming, so I stuck with it.”
Kira had other goals in mind outside of the water as well. “When I graduated high school, I wanted to study physical therapy,” she said. “But I’d been training with our national team since I was 13 and it was really, really hard to combine studying and swimming. The Dutch swimming federation also didn’t really encourage me to pursue my studies. But I knew I wanted to, and my parents wanted me to as well, so I left the Netherlands and moved to the Unites States to go to college.”
A friend of Kira’s suggested she take a look at the University of Tennessee because of its athletic department’s “very scientific approach to things.”
“Ever since I was very young, the Dutch swim federation had been working with a Belgian professor name Jan Olbrecht,” Kira said. “On a recruiting trip to Tennessee, the coach there told me they worked with him too. ‘I was like oh wow, this is pretty cool.’ That, along with the way the team and coaches made me feel, I knew I could cancel all my other trips, I was going there.”
Olbrecht is world renowned for his use of lactate testing to improve athletic training, specifically for swimmers. It played a significant role in Kira getting her swimming career back on track during her junior year at Tennessee.",7/21/17

It was also around that time that Kira was introduced to WHOOP.
“Our coach sent out an email asking us if we were interested in using WHOOP,” she said. “When I saw what it could do, I was like ‘Oh my god, that’s so cool,’ and I signed up right away. After I started using it, we quickly realized that I needed to recover more and I needed more rest. I decided on my own to sleep more, not go out as much, and not drink alcohol. I saw in my data that all that stuff was really affecting me. There were three months until NCAA championships and four months until Olympic trials, and I thought ‘this is what I need to do if I really want to be serious about this.’
Below are Kira’s Recoveries from December of 2015, her first month on the system:
In addition to changing her behavior out of the pool, Kira and her coaches adjusted her training program. “I had red WHOOP Recoveries all the time,” she said. “My lactate test results were also going down significantly, which usually means that you’re training too hard and doing too much. Practices that the coaches thought were really easy were causing very high Strain values for me. I’d be like ‘Hey guys, that easy practice yesterday was a 17 Strain.’ My heart rate was escalating very quickly in comparison to the other swimmers.”
“We started having me swim more slowly than other people on the team, or I would take a morning off, that kind of thing. We modified my training a lot. I rested more and did less. I dropped so much time in those 3-4 months.”
As you can see below in the screenshot of Kira’s data from January and February of 2016, she adapted her Strain to what her body could handle. Her high and low Strain days (in blue) coincided with her high and low Recoveries (green and yellow):",7/21/17
olympic-swimmer-kira-toussaint-shares-whoop-data-training-world-championships,How Olympic Swimmer Kira Toussaint Uses WHOOP Data to Train for World Championships,"“In swimming, there’s a perception that you always need to work as hard as possible all the time,” Kira told us. “No pain no gain, rest is for the weak, that kind of stuff. But in training, that’s not really how it works. Rest is important, one of the most important things, actually. WHOOP helped me to realize that.”
The following April, five months after getting on the WHOOP platform, Kira qualified for the 2016 Rio Olympics in the 100-meter backstroke.
“In the Netherlands, you have be top two to make the Olympic team,” she explained. “You also have to make a certain time, we call it the cut. The cut is the 12th-best time in the world rankings from the year before. Those times are really fast. Before trials I knew I had to drop a lot of time. Nobody besides my coach and I thought I was going to make it. I’d been training in the U.S. for two-and-a-half years and I was kind of out of the picture back home. But I came home for trials and dropped all the time that I needed to.”
Kira hit the cut time exactly, swimming the 100 meters in 60.25 seconds.
This past spring, Kira qualified for the 2017 World Championships in the 50-meter backstroke.
“Since school got out in May, I don’t have as many red days any more,” she said. “I don’t have to go to class all day and swim, I don’t have to find the balance between training and my schoolwork. My resting heart rate has gone down and my HRV (heart rate variability) has gone up. I’ve had more rest and less stress.”
As a result, Kira increased her Strain levels as she focussed solely on preparing for the World Championships in Budapest (the blue bars represent Strain from workouts she logged):
The clip below is from May 29th, when she registered a total Day Strain of 20.4:

one-more-season-big-papi,"One More Season, Big Papi?","Seeing this every day is a constant reminder of the pleasure it’s been to watch Ortiz take the field in a Red Sox uniform for the past 14 years. In particular, the 2004 championship is one of the single greatest memories of my lifetime (which I’m sure is the case for a large number of sports-crazed New Englanders).
But as I pass by this window each morning, I can’t help but wonder, is there a chance Ortiz might decide to come back? And what if WHOOP could play a role in prolonging his career?
The first thing the Red Sox should do is offer him a one-year deal with a blank check. Name your price, Papi. $25 million? Done. Obviously it’s not all about the money though, Boston would have to present Ortiz with a strategy to help his body withstand the rigors of another MLB season.
One option might be to suggest he only suit up for roughly 100 (of 162) games next year. The Sox could plan to rest him on days when the team travelled the night before, as well as for afternoon contests when they played the previous evening. Ortiz could also be removed from games for a pinch runner whenever he gets on base in the later innings.
Last June, Big Papi told ESPN Deportes “Everything hurts. It even hurts to think. Last time I reached second after a double, I almost called for a timeout so they would get me out of the game. I can barely run because my feet hurt so much. I am in severe pain. One often tries to live in the moment, and even when your body is saying no, you say yes, even when your body says not to. Only mental strength convinces you that you can continue. Mental strength tells you that you can keep at it. But the body is a machine; it will give out and will send you a bill.”
WHOOP has the potential to help Ortiz avoid paying that bill just yet. Gaining a better understanding of his Sleep, Strain and Recovery could go a long way towards maintaining the mental (and physical) strength needed to continue playing the game he loves.",11/11/16
one-more-season-big-papi,"One More Season, Big Papi?","The 2016 Major League Baseball season has come to a close. As the long, dark days of winter slowly creep in, ballparks across the country sit lonely and empty until springtime.
Although there aren’t any games being played, the league’s front offices remain hard at work. Now is the time when teams begin shifting their focus to the year ahead. With franchises setting their sights on building contending rosters for 2017, there are trades to be made and free agents to be signed.
One player on the open market batted .315 with 38 home runs, 127 RBI and a .620 slugging percentage (the best in baseball) last year. He’s a 10-time All-Star with three World Series rings, coming off his most productive season in nearly a decade. Every club in the majors would love to have his bat in the lineup next year.
Unfortunately, David Ortiz says he is retired.
Considering the physical condition of his body and the fact that he’ll turn 41 years old later this month, it’s no surprise that Ortiz decided to call it a career. But from the perspective of a sports fan (and a life-long Boston Red Sox diehard), it simply doesn’t seem right for a guy to hang ’em up after putting together a season like Big Papi just did. Legends are supposed to retire when they are no longer able to compete with the game’s rising stars–not when they’re still performing at an MVP-caliber level.

It featured NBA superstars (LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Carmelo Anthony), legendary NFL quarterbacks (Tom Brady and Joe Montana), the greatest female tennis player of all time (Serena Williams), an iconic New York Yankee (Derek Jeter), and the most recognizable athlete on the planet (Cristiano Ronaldo).
Also cracking the list was New York Jets offensive lineman Kelvin Beachum.

“[Sports tech] is the avenue to be at the intersection of a variety of different arenas,” Beachum told us. “Due to the nature of playing football and the platform that I’ve been given, I have the ability to influence a number of different sectors. I’m very active on LinkedIn, something that not many athletes use. That’s really been a springboard for me as a thought leader and to be able to connect with some of the top influencers in the tech industry.”
When asked if he might pursue a second career in technology after his days as an NFL player are over, Beachum said: “It’ll definitely be an area that I’ll look into. I’d like to be able to use my influence and capital to add value to companies that I feel are up and coming. Not only in the sports-tech arena, but in others that are changing the way we see the world, and how we interact with the world around us.”

It was through his role there that WHOOP first appeared on his radar.
“I was at [the OneTeam Collective] pitch day at the Super Bowl earlier this year,” Beachum said. “I had a chance to see Will [Ahmed] pitch the company and I had a great experience hearing what he had to say about the benefits of the product. Afterwards there was a reception and I had the opportunity to speak with both Will and John [Capodilupo], the CTO. I got to ask some more questions and take a deeper dive into WHOOP. I learned how it could be beneficial to me and other athletes, not only in the National Football League, but other athletes around the world.”
Beachum started wearing WHOOP a short time later, and he’s been on the system ever since. What was it that got him hooked? “Measuring heart rate variability and how the heart responds to different levels of strain and recovery,” he explained.
“I don’t need to be able to count my steps. I’m a professional athlete, I’m stepping enough. I need to be able to know what type of damage is being done to my body, what type of recovery does my body need, and how does sleep apply to how I may feel.”
“I’m actually not a guy that’s into wearables,” Beachum elaborated. “This is the first time that I’ve worn something for this long. I’m not a watch guy, so this is a big step for me because I don’t usually wear anything on my wrist. But I’ve had WHOOP on for several months now, and I’ve had a very good experience with it.”
With the 2017 NFL season fast approaching, we asked Beachum how WHOOP has helped him improve his training and prepare for the year ahead. He noted the ability to effectively quantify how certain behaviors affect his body:",8/9/17

In overtime, Mahomes and Kansas City immediately marched 75 yards down the field in 8 plays to score the winning touchdown. Mahomes completed all 6 passes he threw for a total of 69 yards, including the game winner just before 8:55 pm.
While Kansas City pulled off its epic victory, Mahomes’ HR climbed from 150 to 169. Once again, it was the thrill of winning that led to his HR rising after calmly orchestrating yet another masterful drive.
After throwing the winning touchdown pass, Mahomes’ heart rate rose to 169 bpm while celebrating the amazing victory.

In total, Mahomes’ activity strain during the game was 18.8 with 2,347 calories burned, and his day strain was 20.4 (on a 0-21 scale). Over the 28 minutes of real time spanning the frantic end of regulation and OT, his average heart rate was nearly 160 bpm. Below is Mahomes’ heart rate data for the entire game.
Many of Mahomes’ highest HR spikes occurred early in the game and when Buffalo had the ball.
As noted by his trainer Bobby Stroupe, the HR spikes didn’t come during pressure-packed situations, but rather following game-changing plays by both teams, often when Mahomes wasn’t even on the field. And in the game’s waning moments, those plays came so frequently that his heart rate rarely had a chance to drop.

Below we take a look at Patrick Mahomes’ strain and heart rate during the defining moments of his club’s miraculous victory.
## A Record-Setting 2 Minutes
With 2 minutes remaining in the game, Kansas City led Buffalo by the score of 26-21. In the final 1:54 of regulation there were 3 lead changes and a tie, including a playoff-record 25 points scored after the 2-minute warning.
At 8:27 pm local time, Mahomes and Kansas City suddenly found themselves trailing 29-26. For the entire game, Mahomes’ average heart rate was 146 beats per minute (peaking at 191 bpm during his rushing TD in the first quarter, and dipping as low as 79). However, for the next 28 minutes, it stayed above 146 the entire time (more on this to follow).
Mahomes’ heart rate peaked at 191 bpm after his rushing touchdown in the first quarter.
Four minutes after falling behind (52 seconds on the game clock), Mahomes threw a 64-yard touchdown pass to retake the lead 33-29. At that moment, his heart rate hit 171 bpm, spiking with the excitement of the go-ahead score after staying fairly steady during the drive.
Then, in only 49 seconds of game time, Buffalo went back on top 36-33.
Now with just 13 seconds remaining on the clock, Mahomes incredibly took his team 44 yards in 2 plays to set up the game-tying field goal. As the kick sailed through the uprights, knotting the score at 36-36 with time expiring, Mahomes’ HR shot up to 162.

Is there a cumulative effect as the football season wears on? How do players balance training and recovery in order to peak on game day? We try to answer these questions and many more as we explore some of Patrick Mahomes’ WHOOP data from the 2020 NFL season.
## Season Highs in Recovery, Strain & Sleep
The three pillars of WHOOP are recovery (how ready your body is to perform from 0-100%), strain (cardiovascular exertion on a 0-21 scale), and sleep. From the season-opening kickoff on September 10, 2020, through the Super Bowl on February 7, 2021, here are Mahomes’ highest daily numbers for each:
Patrick Mahomes’ highest recovery, strain and sleep tracked by WHOOP during the 2020 NFL season.
“[Checking my recovery score is] the first thing I do when I wake up,” Patrick said on an upcoming episode of the WHOOP Podcast. “I look at it because I want to know how I’m feeling, how my body is feeling, where I’m at. Usually if I’m feeling pretty relaxed it’s a pretty good score.”",5/18/21
patrick-mahomes-heart-rate-strain-data,Patrick Mahomes’ WHOOP Data: Quantifying the Strain of an NFL Season,"Tuesdays were clearly a day to “rest” (although it’s hard to categorize an 11.8 strain as “rest,” more on this later), and Mahomes’ team typically did not practice. Stroupe noted that “Kansas City has some of the hardest practices in the NFL on Thursdays every week. They simulate a lot of game-type situations, and that’s why you’re seeing a lot of high strain those days.” He also pointed out that Mahomes practices just like he plays, giving it his all.
It falls in line that Saturday would be one of Mahomes’ lowest-strain days, as he aims to get his body prepared for Sunday. “He’s literally one of the most active players in pro sports,” Stroupe added. “I’m making changes on my end from a volume standpoint based on his strain scores from week to week.”",5/18/21
patrick-mahomes-heart-rate-strain-data,Patrick Mahomes’ WHOOP Data: Quantifying the Strain of an NFL Season,"Grind of the NFL Season
Amazingly, Mahomes’ average strain on non-game days was still 13.9. To put that in perspective, the average day strain for all WHOOP members last year was only 10.7 (see graphic above).
The key point to keep in mind here is that WHOOP strain is relative to each individual, so the argument that he’s a world-class athlete who can take on more doesn’t apply. Anything 14 and above is considered fairly strenuous regardless of who you are, and he averaged that for the entire season (on his “off” days no less). Every human body needs rest, and from September through February Mahomes performed at an elite level while operating like a machine.
Here’s a glimpse at his rolling 10-day strain average for the entire season:
The 10-day rolling average of Patrick Mahomes’ WHOOP strain spanning the 2020 NFL season.
Viewing a 10-day average smoothes out the data and eliminates a lot of day-to-day fluctuation so trends can better stand out. Mahomes’ strain really elevated in late October and November and then basically stayed that way for the remainder of the season. The dip in mid-November reflects a bye week that month, and the drop in January follows back-to-back weeks without playing.
“It does make so much sense,” Mahomes said when seeing how his strain built as the season progressed. “Obviously every game is important, but September and October you’re feeling out what you are as a team. As you get to November and December and obviously January and February, your intensity picks up as you’re trying to win these football games.”
## Green Recovery & Best Game of the Year
On Sunday November 1st, before he really started taking on intense levels of strain from the grueling demands of the long season, Mahomes woke up with a 91% WHOOP recovery. His body was primed to perform, and it showed.
That afternoon, he completed 31 of 42 passes for 416 yards and a season-high 5 touchdown passes. He also posted a passer rating of 144.4, his best of the year.",5/18/21

What follows is an example of Mahomes’ heart rate data (including sleep and strain from activities) over the course of a typical game day:
A sample of Patrick Mahomes’ WHOOP heart rate data on the day of a game.
You can see that beginning about 90 minutes before kickoff, his HR rarely dips below 125 beats per minute. And from the time the game starts, it stays fairly steady in the 150-190 range (with a brief dip at halftime).
Mahomes’ total day strain on this particular Sunday was 20.7 (the more strain you take on the harder it is to build, so day strain does not equal the sum of strain from activities). For context, athletes who run a marathon or compete in an Ironman triathlon often have strains of 20.7 that day–but nobody runs a marathon every weekend for five straight months.
Spanning the entire season, Mahomes’ average strain during games was 16.7, with his overall day strain on game days averaging 19.3.

patrick-mahomes-heart-rate-strain-data,Patrick Mahomes’ WHOOP Data: Quantifying the Strain of an NFL Season,"What Causes the Most Strain?
Looking through Mahomes’ most strenuous days of the season and comparing them to his in-game stats, there was a noticeable correlation between his number of pass attempts and high strain. For a quarterback who makes every effort to move all over the field and find the ideal target, this makes perfect sense:
September 9th – 47 pass attempts (2nd highest total of season) in overtime win, 20.7 day strain
September 9th – 47 pass attempts (2nd highest total of season) in overtime win, 20.7 day strain
November 29th – 49 attempts in victory over Tampa Bay, 20.6 day strain
November 29th – 49 attempts in victory over Tampa Bay, 20.6 day strain
February 7th – 49 attempts in Super Bowl, 20.7 day strain
February 7th – 49 attempts in Super Bowl, 20.7 day strain
Interestingly enough, both of Mahomes’ highs in pass attempts this past season came against Tampa Bay. Also worth noting from the Super Bowl (in which he had a 20.5 activity strain), Mahomes set a record for quarterbacks for the year by running 497 yards before throws or sacks. It’s no wonder he pushed his body to the max that day.

With Sundays normally being game days, there are distinct patterns that emerge from week to week in a player’s training load. Mahomes played in 14 games on Sundays, three on Mondays and one on a Thursday (he sat out one Sunday as well).
To no surprise, Sundays were a very high-strain day for him (16.5 on average). Also quite predictable, Mondays were his lowest average recovery day by far, at just 45.7%.
Below is a chart depicting Mahomes’ average strain for each day of the week:
The average WHOOP strain Patrick Mahomes took on By day of the week during the 2020 season.
The 15.8 average strain on Mondays might be unexpected, but is understandable given the effects of three games, plus the fact that strain accumulates faster when your body is under-recovered. Basically, his workouts had a greater cardiovascular impact those days as his body was less capable than usual of taking on stress.
Additionally, Mahomes’ personal coach Bobby Stroupe told us that on Mondays they often did strength training with high aerobic output in order to “flush out the toxins” and reset for the week ahead.
Tuesdays were clearly a day to “rest” (although it’s hard to categorize an 11.8 strain as “rest,” more on this later), and Mahomes’ team typically did not practice. Stroupe noted that “Kansas City has some of the hardest practices in the NFL on Thursdays every week.

Mahomes is one of the best athletes in the world and he works hard to maintain his body’s fitness baseline so he can take on the rigors of the NFL and effectively prepare to peak on the right day each week. During 2021, he experienced his best recovery (98%) in a Week 15 victory over the Chargers as well as a strong recovery (92%) in the AFC Championship.Heading into his sixth NFL season, Mahomes had to deal with different challenges than in years past including building chemistry with a new wide receiver core. That pressure to perform isn’t new for Mahomes though and he relies heavily on recovery to stay ready for whatever the season throws at him.
At the end of the 2021 season, Mahomes underwent successful toe surgery following a playoff injury. Stroupe noted that offseason workouts almost doubled in length to four hours to include physical therapy. Despite the longer days, Mahomes’ strain was lower than usual with efforts geared towards recovery and getting back to his baseline.
In the lead up to the 2022 season, Stroupe and a healthy Mahomes focused on unlocking his physiological potential. Stroupe shared that Mahomes has made a transition and they’ve, “been able to throw more than they have in the past three years while focusing more on movement and power capabilities.” They haven’t stopped working since the end of last season and Stroupe believes “all signs are pointing to Mahomes being in a place to play the game only he can.”",9/14/22

Mahomes’ heart rate reached a game high at 191 beats per minute (bpm) during his rushing touchdown in the first quarter. Below is Mahomes’ heart rate data for the entire game:
In overtime, Mahomes’ heart rate actually spiked in the moments when he was on the sideline watching the opposing team try to score, and it stayed even when he was on the field in the heat of competition. Mahomes’ personal trainer Bobby Stroupe notes that this type of experience is a flow state – where you’re totally focused and all of your energy is so in the moment that nothing can distract you.
During practice sessions, Stroupe tries to desensitize Mahomes to “free flow a movement to where it’s more natural and reactive.” Stroupe creates competitive situations in practice with just one rep or set because it forces the mindset that there’s no second or third shot at getting it right. “There’s a neural component to knowing that there’s no take backs” and consistently training like that prepares Mahomes for those moments.",9/14/22
patrick-mahomes-the-data-behind-an-nfl-season-with-whoop,Patrick Mahomes: The Data Behind an NFL Season with WHOOP,"THE IMPACT OF AN NFL SEASON
Going beyond strain and in-game highlights, recovery helps you understand how hard you can push yourself. Resting heart rate (RHR) and heart rate variability (HRV) are two key components of WHOOP recovery which also provide greater insight into overall health.
RHR is a measure of your average heart beats per minute while you’re in a state of complete rest and it’s an important metric for monitoring fitness level. HRV is literally the variance or time in between heart beats. It’s a measure of your autonomic nervous system and considered one of the best objective metrics for determining your body’s readiness to perform.
Below is an overview of Mahomes’ HRV and RHR trends throughout the different stages of the 2021 season leading into the 2022 opener:
The long-term view of Mahomes’ data highlights the serious amount of stress his body takes on month to month and the grind of the NFL season.
If you’re looking to improve your overall health over time, you want to see your average RHR go down and your average HRV gradually increase. From the beginning of training camp 2021 through the regular season, Mahomes’ RHR increased by 23.2% and his HRV decreased by 6.8%. The data paint a clearer picture of just how much that accumulated exertion weighs on Mahomes.
Despite these trends, Mahomes’ HRV shot up to its highest seasonal average during the playoffs as he focused on rest and recovery. Heading into the 2022 season, we see his RHR and HRV return to his normal baseline as he prepares his body to do it all again.",9/14/22
patrick-mahomes-the-data-behind-an-nfl-season-with-whoop,Patrick Mahomes: The Data Behind an NFL Season with WHOOP,"STRAIN: THE REGULAR SEASON VS. OFFSEASON
WHOOP quantifies the amount of physical and mental stress you put on your body. Strain is tracked as an overall total for the entire day and can be broken down by specific workouts and activities.
With Sundays normally being game days, there are clear strain trends throughout the week. Mahomes averaged a 19.5 day strain on Sundays during the regular season which is almost equivalent to the cardiovascular exertion of running a marathon. Below is a chart depicting Mahomes’ average strain for each day of the week across the 2021 regular season compared to the offseason:
Mahomes’ best recovery day during the regular season was Sunday (73.5% on average) so he was ready to take on strain and, unsurprisingly, his worst was Monday (57.8%). On those Mondays, Mahomes prioritizes rest and keeping his lower average strain. After that initial day of recovery, he ramps training back up again through the week before focusing again on moderate strain to be fully recovered for the next opponent. In the offseason, Mahomes maintains a consistently lower level of strain, but pulls back even more on the weekends to take full advantage of rest days.",9/14/22
patrick-mahomes-the-data-behind-an-nfl-season-with-whoop,Patrick Mahomes: The Data Behind an NFL Season with WHOOP,"PATRICK’S PASSIONS: TRACKING GOLF V. FOOTBALL
While his focus is on football year-round, Mahomes is able to take a step back during the offseason, spend more time with his family, and take up other interests that challenge his mind and body.
In reviewing golf activities during the time between the 2021 and 2022 season, Mahomes average max heart rate was 154.2 bpm with an average heart rate of 119.8 bpm. His golf sessions were typically 2 hours and 15 minutes, burning approximately 830 calories while accruing a 10.97 average strain.
Below is an example of Mahomes’ data from one golf outing in June 2021 compared to Week 8 win over the Giants on Monday, November 1, 2021:
The aerobic heart rate zone is a heart rate between 70% and 80% of your maximum heart rate. When it comes to individual workouts, more intense aerobic exercise leads to higher strain than less intense activity. The average strain of 1 hour of running is roughly 12.0. While playing golf, Mahomes spends most of his time in two main heart rate zones (50-60% and 60-70%) and Stroupe likes when he walks the course for a different aerobic benefit. These are very light to light exertion levels which can help build basic endurance over a long period of exercise or serve as active recovery. Stroupe thinks golf is good offseason cross-training which teaches frontal plane power, adding that “frontal plane development helps the body produce power at different angles.”
An NFL game is clearly more strenuous than a golf outing, but the length of a day at the course can still have an impact on your body. When he reports to training camp, Mahomes puts his golf clubs away for the season and puts all of himself into football.",9/14/22

We take a look back at Patrick Mahomes’ 2021 NFL data to understand how he prepares to peak this season.
## A YEAR IN SLEEP, STRAIN & RECOVERY
The three pillars of WHOOP are Recovery (how ready your body is to perform from 0-100%), Strain (cardiovascular exertion on a 0-21 scale), and Sleep. From the start of training camp on July 28, 2021 through August 25, 2022, here are Mahomes’ highest totals across each phase of the year:
Going deeper into the data of each part of the 2021 season, Mahomes racked up his highest average strain as well as his highest average recovery during training camp. The higher average strain is likely a result of Mahomes’ body reacclimating and ramping up to the intensity of football. At the same time, the increased average recovery highlights the balance needed to prepare for the long season to come.
Sleep plays an integral role in recovery and the high individual days during the regular season and postseason show just how much is required of Mahomes to keep up. In fact, he clocked in his highest average sleep period during the playoffs – an 8.1% increase compared to the regular season – so he was primed for the biggest games of the year.",9/14/22
personalize-running-training-1500m-marathon,Personalizing your Running Training: From 1500m to Marathon,"How to Personalize Your Training As a Runner
Find a coach, team, or support system willing to work with your needs as an individual athlete. It’s important to choose a coach who is willing to adjust training on a regular basis, rather than providing a cookie-cutter program.
Get in-person evaluation. While many coaches offer virtual programs, it’s impossible to get the most out of a runner without in-person observations, where you can see visible imbalances, running form, and effort.
Experiment with recovery modalities to see what works best. TME member Sam Parsons has been experimenting with different forms of recovery for a long time, and has seen significant benefits in his HRV from practicing mindfulness, meditation, and reducing emotional stressors in his life. Using the WHOOP Journal feature allows athletes to log their recovery modalities and see how they directly impact their performance via the Monthly Performance Assessment.
Don’t compare mileage and metrics. Because no body is the same, different runners will have different thresholds for mileage and workouts. Some runners might require three days of recovery, while others might bounce back in two, which is why knowing your physiological baseline (resting heart rate, typical HRV range) and monitoring daily recovery is imperative.
Have a flexible cross-training plan in place. Runners are bound to deal with a nagging pain at some point. It’s important to be extremely flexible if anything flares up, so as not to push towards injury. In Project PR, runners were encouraged to replace running with biking or the elliptical to continue training.

It’s been a challenging year for Tinman Elite. Some of their top performers including Drew, Sam Parsons, and Jordan Gusman battled injury and dealt with mounting external pressures to make the team successful. During the German Championships, Sam partially tore his gastroc muscle early on in his 5k race. He gutted it out for a full 10 minutes, but was forced to drop out due to the pain.
It seemed like the extra pandemic year of training for Tokyo was good for some who needed to improve fitness, but physically and emotionally taxing for many who were hoping to peak that summer of 2020. Several world-class runners including Molly Huddle, Shannon Rowbury, Evan Jager, and WHOOP member Colleen Quiqley all pulled out of the trials, citing injury, and even mental exhaustion.
For Tinman Elite, it was no different. They needed a change, and they needed a critical level of personalization to their training that some of the men just weren’t getting. “As far as injuries go, one thing I’ve noticed is that injured athletes often lose connection to their team and coaches, since they aren’t there training with them. I tend to be pretty hands on with injured athletes and try to be engaged in their rehab and cross training during that time,” said Joan.
The Tinman Elite roster includes athletes who specialize in the 1500m up to the marathon. While they can do a lot of base mileage and easy runs together, the individual workouts and strength training will be more specialized under Joan with 1:1 in-person attention.
“I value my athletes as people and always seek to build genuine connection and trust between them and me, and each other,” Joan explained. “Running can be a pretty selfish pursuit, and it needs to be in some ways, but sharing goals, working together, and supporting each other makes the experience more enjoyable and successful for everyone.”",7/14/21

## “I quickly fell in love with coaching and found it more rewarding than my own running.”
Who is Joan Hunter? If you’re an avid runner, chances are you know her son Drew, who set multiple state and national high school records and currently trains with Tinman Elite in Boulder, CO. But not many people know Joan — mother of 9, former Master’s runner record holder, and coach — because she’s always been relatively low profile. Like many of the best coaches, she’s not on social media often and is rarely public facing. But today, she announces her new position as head coach of Tinman Elite (TME), which comes at a crucial time as the team looks to expand, overcome injury, and rebuild.
Currently, only 3% of collegiate men’s teams are coached by women. As for the professional running world, that number is even smaller. Simply put, it’s rare to see female leadership at the highest of levels in this sport, a discrepancy that has been covered by Runner’s World, The New York Times, and more.
Joan brings over 25 years of experience to the team, and originally coached her son Drew through his junior year of high school.

In a running study led by WHOOP in partnership with Tracksmith and Outside Magazine, we found that runners training for a 5k could reduce their risk of injury by up to 32% simply by modifying training each day based on recovery. Runners with a specialized (versus generic) training program adjusted daily time and intensity based on their body’s needs, which resulted in improved performances and fewer reported injuries. It seems intuitive, but it’s not always applied, even at the most elite level.
“In running, recovery is so important. It’s the most important thing in the world as far as absorbing the training you are able to put in,” explained Joan. “WHOOP allows us to get a more complete picture of each runner’s recovery — their sleep, HRV, resting heart rate, etc. Each morning, I check the team’s WHOOP scores and adjust training accordingly if necessary. This will help us perform at a higher level and hopefully avoid injuries as we go forward.”

pillars-of-performance-ed-brown-patron-ceo-esm-driver,"9 Questions with Ed Brown, Patron CEO & ESM Driver","Patron President Ed Brown answers 9 questions about his performance lifestyle as a CEO and Extreme Speed Motorsports driver.
In 2000, Ed Brown, a University of Texas graduate, took over as President and Chief Executive Officer of Patron Spirits International. Since that time, the company’s sales have increased by nearly 2000%, while its Tequila has become a pop cultural phenomenon featuring one of the world’s most recognizable liquor bottles. Brown also went from sponsoring a NASCAR driver and putting the company logo on a car to becoming one of the founders of Extreme Speed Motorsports, an endurance auto racing team.
Last year Brown, who is also a driver, and the rest of the Patron ESM squad took first place at the Rolex 24 in Daytona, one of two world-renowned 24-hour races. They also finished 16th at the other, the 24 Hours of Le Mans, at the Circuit de la Sarthe in Le Mans, France. And while Patron ESM doesn’t have a car in the 85th running of the 24 Hours of Le Mans this weekend (June 17-18), Brown’s teammates Brendon Hartley, Bruno Senna and Pipo Derani will all be competing.
We recently asked Brown, who’s been on the system since January, our 9 Pillars of Performance questions on Strain, Sleep and Recovery.
1. Describe your workout regimen on high-Strain days.
EB: I lift weights for an hour-and-a-half, then either go for a hard run or bike ride.
2. What piece of advice do you find yourself giving most often?
EB: No matter what it is, if you work harder than anyone else you can be successful.
3. Who in your profession would you most like to compete against, all time?
EB: Ayrton Senna. I’ve gone up against many great drivers, but he was amazing (Senna, a Brazilian driver and three-time Formula One world-champion, was killed in a crash in 1994 at age 34).
4. How often do you nap?
EB: A few times a week.
5. What’s your routine the night before big events?
EB: I eat clean and try not to stress about sleep.
6. What’s the first thing you do when you wake up?",6/17/17
pillars-of-performance-ed-brown-patron-ceo-esm-driver,"9 Questions with Ed Brown, Patron CEO & ESM Driver","EB: I drink a large bottle of water and then plan my day.
7. How do you handle jet lag?
EB: I get a workout in and sleep whenever I’m tired, no matter what time it is. I also drink a ton of water.
8. When did you have your worst WHOOP Recovery?
EB: It came after a night filled with lots of Patron and very little sleep.
9. Finish this sentence: WHOOP has made me realize…
EB: …how important quality sleep is, and how much better I can perform when I’m on a high Recovery phase.

pillars-performance-mike-mancias-nba-trainer,"9 Questions with Mike Mancias, NBA Trainer","Originally from Brownsville, TX, Mike Mancias began his career in athletic training as the student manager of the University of Texas-Pan American men’s basketball team. In the summer of 2001, Mancias landed an internship with Tim Grover of Attack Athletics, where he had the opportunity to work with Michael Jordan during his NBA comeback. Three years later, Mancias became an assistant trainer with the Cleveland Cavaliers in LeBron James’ second season in the league. For the past decade, Mancias has served as James’ personal trainer.
We recently caught up with Mancias in New York, fresh off a red-eye flight from Hong Kong. A loyal WHOOP user since 2015, he was kind enough to sit down with us and share his thoughts on Strain, Sleep, and Recovery.
1. Describe your workout regimen on high-Strain days.
MM: On high-Strain days we’ll do three different workouts. We’ll start in the morning with a cardio session, maybe on a treadmill or a versaclimber, for 30-45 minutes. Then we’ll do weightroom activity for another 45 minutes. Then obviously we’ll do some basketball on-court work, probably for an hour-and-a-half. By the time we’re done with all three, it’s definitely a high-Strain day.
2. What training tip do you give most often to amateurs?
MM: If you play a sport, you want to have fun and be competitive, but also take care of your body. Be smart when you’re out there playing.
3. Who in your profession would you most like to work with, all time?
MM: I’ve been blessed to work with some of the greats in the game of basketball, obviously. I guess there’s one athlete who transcended sports, and that’s Muhammad Ali. That’d be who I’d love to be around. Working alongside his trainer, the late Angelo Dundee, that would’ve been an honor to be involved with those guys, to see what their training was like and what Ali’s motivation was every single day.
4. How often do you nap?",9/20/17
pillars-performance-mike-mancias-nba-trainer,"9 Questions with Mike Mancias, NBA Trainer","MM: I try to nap every day for about 20 minutes. Sometimes we don’t have that luxury, but ideally I’d like to get in 20 minutes a day.
5. What’s your bedtime routine?
MM: At home it’s different than when I’m on the road because I have a 14-month old son. My routine is his routine. If he goes to sleep at a decent hour, then we can get a good night’s rest too.
6. What’s the first thing you do when you wake up?
MM: If my son’s not awake already, I like to go out for a quick walk on my own, get out of the house and start the day off with some exercise. I use it to clear my head and get my mind ready for the day.
7. How do you handle jet lag?
MM: Jet lag is a physical thing, but it’s also mental. If you know you have a long trip, prepare yourself. Do the little things like hydrate throughout your trip, get up and stretch if you can, and when you finally get to your destination maybe ride a bike or do some quick treadmill work for about 20 minutes. “Sweat out the plane” is what I call it.
8. When did you have your worst WHOOP Recovery?
MM: During the 2016 NBA Finals. My son was born the day before we won the championship. He was born in Cleveland, then I had to fly to Oakland the very next morning, then fly right back to Cleveland. I was jet-lagged, I was tired, I was sleep deprived, my Recovery was shot. But I was very, very happy.
9. Finish this sentence: WHOOP has made me realize…
MM: …that no matter how good you are, no matter how prepared you think you are, you have to listen to your body. WHOOP is the one device that can read your body and give you the right feedback on what you need to do to get that edge and be a better athlete.

4. How often do you nap?
SB: Luckily, I have a schedule that doesn’t have many early mornings so I can get all my Sleep at night. I do squeeze in naps whenever I can, though. Almost always on plane rides, and I coffee nap on game days.
5. What’s your bedtime routine?
SB: Just recently I’ve started using a humidifier and essential oils. I do like watching TV because it’s soothing and mindless, and it puts me to sleep fast.
6. What’s the first thing you do when you wake up?
SB: Check the time and see how long I slept. Compare how I feel to what WHOOP tells me.
7. How do you handle jet lag?
SB: In my off-season I almost always work out upon arrival, I find that it helps. My biggest piece of advice is to not stress out about it. The stress can sometimes make it worse.
8. When did you have your worst WHOOP Recovery?
SB: Well, It’s official. Drinking alcohol is bad and weddings are fun. I attended one of my best friend’s weddings and my Recovery was at 2% because of a late night and an early morning flight. The life of athlete sometimes has this combo because of late games and travel too, but my Recovery has never been that low. Alcohol!

The 7-time All-WNBA point guard was also kind enough to answer our Pillars of Performance questions on Strain, Sleep and Recovery.
1. Describe your workout regimen on high-Strain days.
SB: On my high Strain days I’m generally doing multiple workouts in the day. I’m currently in season, but before it started I had to have knee surgery. While I was pushing to get back, I would do on-court workouts, lifts, and sometimes extra things like pilates. The combo always led to high Strain.
2. What training tip do you give most often to amateurs?
SB: I’ve found that what separates athletes isn’t always talent. Yes, that is a huge component, and honing your skills must be a part of your regimen, BUT being in the best shape possible is also a major piece of the puzzle. Let’s put it this way – skill can be affected if you are fatigued. But if you’re never tired, your skill is only enhanced.",7/25/17

VP of Data Science and Research Emily Capodilupo breaks down our latest research, which found that the majority of 1,200 vaccinated WHOOP members did not show a significant difference in recovery, resting heart rate or heart rate variability after getting the shot.
This study also found that those who did see a change in physiological metrics did not experience a diminished recovery for more than a day or two.

We’ve put WHOOP straps on over 1,000 Army personnel in the Arctic to better understand how their bodies respond to high-stress environments.
As we know, it gets cold in Alaska, and sunlight is especially hard to come by at this time of year. The Army has partnered with WHOOP to study how circadian alignment impacts physiological metrics, heart rate variability, and self-reported measures of resilience.
WHOOP Director of Military Teams Robert Moeller is behind the mic for this episode and sits down with WHOOP VP of Performance Kristen Holmes, principal investigator on the study, and Army Chief Warrant Officer Phil Ranck. They discuss what the Army and WHOOP hope to learn about resilience through the lens of physiological data, everything you need to know about HRV and why it’s an excellent indicator of how your body is handling stress, and how perceived readiness and actual physiological readiness align.

podcast-120-pga-tour-commissioner-jay-monahan,Podcast 120: PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan on Keeping Golf Safe in Pandemic & Partnership with WHOOP,"PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan joins our podcast for a wide-ranging discussion about golf navigating the pandemic, optimal performance, and the Tour's groundbreaking new partnership with WHOOP.
Jay Monahan is an impressive figure in the sports world. Thanks in large part to his steady-handed leadership, golf was the first pro sport to return last summer during the pandemic. The PGA Tour paved the way for other leagues to return in the following months and set a successful precedent for how to continue playing in unprecedented times.
But it wasn’t easy. The Tour dealt with a number of positive COVID-19 tests shortly after returning to play. When Nick Watney’s WHOOP captured an elevated respiratory rate that warned him of his infection, the PGA immediately procured 1,000 WHOOP Straps to help keep players, caddies, and staff members safe.
Now, WHOOP is the Official Fitness Wearable of the PGA Tour. This partnership not only helps players perform at their best and stay healthy on Tour, but it will change the way golf fans consume the sport. We’ll soon be showing you players’ heart rate and biometric data during the biggest moments of the season. You’ll see a WHOOP Live of a pressure shot and be able to watch how that moment affected the golfer in real time.
And for each WHOOP Live we feature, we’ll donate $10,000 to that player’s charity of choice.
Jay discusses what charity means to him and how it’s core to everything the PGA Tour does, how golfers on Tour are more focused on health and performance than ever before, and the global impact of Hideki Matsuyama’s win at the Masters.

podcast-121-covid-vaccines-doses-heart-rate-sleep,"Podcast 121: How Different COVID Vaccines and Doses Affect Heart Rate, Sleep, Fatigue & More","On this episode of our podcast, VP of Data Science and Research Emily Capodilupo breaks down the effects we’ve seen in WHOOP data from the various COVID-19 vaccines, and how the second doses impact people differently than the first. We also share highlights from an in-app AMA with Emily answering questions on the subject.
Emily Capodilupo, WHOOP VP of Data Science and Research, returns to the WHOOP Podcast to detail our latest COVID-19 vaccine research.
This research indicates that younger people are more likely to be affected by the vaccine than older people. Additionally, our findings show that you should expect to feel more rundown by the second dose of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines than the first. The single shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine, meanwhile, looks similar in the data to the second dose of Moderna.
We’ve also seen that the vaccines can temporarily elevate your resting heart rate, lower your heart rate variability (HRV), and reduce the amount of restorative sleep you get. These aftereffects are short-lived, as WHOOP members who did experience a change in their physiological metrics returned to baseline quickly, often 24 hours after the shot.
Our full research on the subject is pending peer review and is available here in preprint.

podcast-121-covid-vaccines-doses-heart-rate-sleep,"Podcast 121: How Different COVID Vaccines and Doses Affect Heart Rate, Sleep, Fatigue & More",Vaccines are pretty specific. The COVID vaccines will likely protect us against small mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 virus (the virus that causes COVID-19) but unfortunately there is no reason to think that it would protect us against other viruses.,4/28/21
podcast-121-covid-vaccines-doses-heart-rate-sleep,"Podcast 121: How Different COVID Vaccines and Doses Affect Heart Rate, Sleep, Fatigue & More","Our study is the first to look at objective sleep and recovery data, so we’re the first ones to show that sleep quality is reduced post-vaccination. This has interesting policy implications for policy makers or employers thinking about offering time off for the vaccines. Sleep deprived workers are more likely to make expensive errors or have work place injuries, and sleep deprived drivers are more likely to get into car crashes, so there are a lot of good reasons to give people a day off to recover post-vaccination.
Have you seen people who previously had COVID show negative recovery stats after the 1st or 2nd dose of the vaccine or both? – Chris V
There is some research (not done by us) that seems to suggest that people who have had COVID already will have stronger reactions to the first shot than people who didn’t previously get COVID. We haven’t looked at the relationship between prior COVID and reaction intensity yet but have seen overall that people react more strongly to the second shot than the first shot, but in both cases the reactions are short-lived and people are back to normal in about a day.
Hey Emily! How is the vaccine affecting women nursing? Can you pass antibodies to your baby? Also should you wait until you’re not as sleep deprived? – Gisella C
WHOOP hasn’t studied vaccine reactions in nursing moms, but other research has shown that antibodies do pass to the baby, so nursing might be a really amazing way to protect a baby that is too young to get the COVID vaccine themselves. While vaccines have been shown to be less effective if you are sleep deprived, they still are more protective than not getting the shot at all so if your doctor says you are safe to get vaccinated it is probably not worth delaying too long.
Is there a possibility that with the vaccine, it’s enhanced the body’s immune response to not only COVID-19 but also general viruses? Or is it very specific? – Olivia R",4/28/21

Emily also answered WHOOP member questions on the subject via an AMA in our app. Here are some of the highlights not covered in the podcast:
Hi Emily! Curious if you have looked at any data on members who logged testing positive for COVID-19 in close proximity to getting vaccinated, and the impact on vaccine symptoms/response? Thank you! – Megan M
Hi Megan! We haven’t actually looked at that yet – there are so many interesting questions we haven’t had time to answer yet! Because vaccine centers aren’t COVID testing the recipients, we know that a lot of people are unknowingly getting vaccinated with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic COVID and it doesn’t seem to be dangerous, but it is unclear right now how their symptoms would change.
I am interested in the difference in severity of the side effects as well as HRV, RHR, and recovery between men and women after dose 2? Also, do you plan to examine the data on where women are in their menstrual cycles when receiving the vaccine and how that might affect recovery? It looks like there may be a link between higher levels of estrogen and a more robust immune response. – Lindsay D
Hi Lindsay, I love this question so much, but sadly we haven’t had time to look at the impact of menstrual phase on vaccine responses yet. This would be such an interesting project though, especially with our new menstrual cycle-based sleep plannering feature. That said, we did look at differences between males and females and found that while men and women generally followed the same patterns, women experienced slightly more symptoms.
What is something interesting that you all learned that isn’t too commonly known from the study? – Ray T",4/28/21

I may try and do some research to try some new things to get it up!
How do you stay consistent and committed to training over long periods of time? When you do fall off track, how do you get back to where you were? – Max M
It’s important to realize there will be bad days. You get better on those days! Having a crew that shows up putting effort in everyday is also very inspiring.
When did you start lifting heavy? What would credit as the most helpful to you in adding weight – or said another way – what do you do to break plateaus? (Maybe you haven’t had any 🙂 – Lisa O
I never touched a barbell until I was 15! I wasn’t strong at all either. I remember doing lots of light-weight reps before I started to get heavier.
What’s your lowest and highest heart rate recorded on WHOOP? – Sean A
I believe 200+ and my resting heart rate is 43-ish!
How do you fit in school and the gym in the same day? And If you would have one piece of advice to get to the CrossFit games what would it be? – Caden R
I took online classes the last 2 semesters. But not close to a full-time load. Just what fits my schedule. Trust the process! Don’t try to rush. Stick with a program and make sure to enjoy it!

Haley also answered questions from our members via an AMA in the WHOOP app, discussing things like training volume, nutrition and sleep habits, and optimizing her recoveries. Below are a few of the highlights:
Hey Haley, what were some things that you changed after you moved to Mayhem? How did your programming and volume change? What are some things that you do differently now than you did before? – Het P
I’ve always trained high volume, but Mayhem programming is the best program I’ve ever been on. Rich obviously knows what he’s doing! My overall fitness and strength has improved since being here.
Since you have recently started wearing WHOOP, what have you discovered about yourself that you now take into consideration while training or recovering? – Jenny M
I’ve really paid more attention to my sleeping patterns! Even little things such as eating something different can have an impact on my recovery I’ve noticed. But mostly getting a good night’s rest is the biggest thing for a good training day.
Are there any techniques/rituals you find particularly effective at boosting your recovery? – Liv W
I’ve been using a sauna 3-4 times a week for 30 min and I’ve loved it! It seems to help my recovery some days too.
When you’re in the red, do you still work out with the same intensity as if you are in the green? And do you have more days in the yellow or green? – Alyssa Z
So most days if I’m in the red, it’s close to a rest day so I will keep the intensity the same. I may feel worse, but with our training that’s normal. I actually have a lot of days in the yellow!
What does your nutrition look like and what foods/nutritional habits boost your recovery? – Jena F
My diet consists of lots of rice, veggies, chicken, some red meat, oatmeal, lots of rice cakes and fruit!
How does your HRV and RHR differ based on your training state? What’s it like weeks before the CrossFit Games vs. early in offseason programs? – Parker M",5/12/21

Patrick Mahomes, NFL MVP and Super Bowl champion, sits down for a wide-ranging discussion on strain, recovery, and peak performance. We dive deep on what Patrick’s WHOOP data looks like and examine the toll a football season takes on the human body.
Patrick shares how his father’s 11-year career in Major League Baseball inspired him to become an athlete, but his path almost went in an entirely different direction. He was encouraged to quit football in high school to focus on baseball and basketball, and he says he didn’t even know he was going to pursue football professionally until a year before he was drafted. Five years later, Patrick is undeniably one of the best players in the NFL.
He talks about using visualization and how it primes him for success, the importance of mindset, and what he’s learned from both victory and defeat. Patrick also explains how WHOOP fits into that equation, and why a passion for his data led to him investing in the company.

Based on the numbers, if the player had an elevated recovery for every game, he would score 12 more goals, would touch the puck an additional 926 times, would complete 763 more passes, and would register 163 more shots.

For every 45 minutes of sleep debt a person accrued, they had a 5-10% decrease in mental control the following day. Conversely, for every 30 minutes of slow wave sleep gained, that person saw a 5-10% increase in mental control the next day.

Colleen is one of the top runners in the United States. She earned nine NCAA All-American honors while running for Florida State University – and won the NCAA Steeplechase in 2015. A year later, she represented the United States at the Olympics in Rio. But, unlike many, the dream of being an Olympian was one she never really had growing up. She explains how her parents helped instill a love of running in her as a teenager, and her career took off after that.
Colleen was on track to go to the Olympics again this year, but injuries derailed her hopes right before the trials. She talks about how injuries have taught her how much running truly means to her, and how mindset is an important tool in overcoming physical setbacks.
Mindset is a big theme of this discussion and Colleen shares how her meditation practice has made her a better runner. I know you’ll find Colleen to be an inspiration, and there’s a lot to take away from her story and her approach.

podcast-139-introducing-the-whoop-4-0,Podcast 139: Introducing the WHOOP 4.0,"25:55 – Improved Signal Quality, Improved Accuracy. “With the WHOOP strap, it all boils down to how accurately can we monitor your body? And so that we spend an enormous amount of time and resources trying to understand how we can make our sensor even more accurate. … We actually built around 90 different sensor configurations and different prototype WHOOP straps looking at how different LEDs and photodiodes could affect the signal to noise ratio,” John says. “We have more LEDs. We have three green LEDs compared to two on the [previous WHOOP]. We also have a red and infrared light to give us SpO2, but these extra lights also come with four photodiodes compared to the one photodiode on [WHOOP 3.0].”
31:19 – When to Expect Your WHOOP 4.0. The 4.0 will begin shipping the week of September 27th. “It’s coming out the door. It’s manufacturing as we speak,” Will says. “If you are an existing member, you’re first in line. Go to the WHOOP app, sign up. If you have over six months of membership, we send it to you for free.”

As always, stay healthy and stay in the green.",9/10/21
podcast-139-introducing-the-whoop-4-0,Podcast 139: Introducing the WHOOP 4.0,"8:52 – Skin Temperature. The WHOOP 4.0 will also track your skin temperature. “We have a thermometer on the WHOOP strap that’s measuring the surface of your skin and how warm it is. The interesting thing is the fluctuations you see, especially while you’re sleeping or at night, can be really important to monitor wellness or illness status,” John says, while adding that this will help WHOOP further understand female physiology and performance.
10:46 – Health Monitor. “We said to ourselves, ‘We need to have a way to alert people in the WHOOP app that something’s awry. And so now the Health Monitor within the WHOOP app is going to tell you if your resting heart rate is out of whack, your heart rate variability is out of whack, your respiratory rate. SpO2, you want to be above 94 percent, It’ll alert you for that. It’ll also keep an eye on skin temperature.”
13:02 – Smart Alarm. “This will give people the ability to programmatically set a sleep goal and using the Sleep Planner … and then the WHOOP strap will silently start vibrating at the appropriate time and wake you up.” The new WHOOP Sleep Planner and smart alarm has 3 modes: Wake up at an exact time, wake up when you meet your sleep goal, or wake up when your body is in the green.
15:57 – Downsizing. The WHOOP 4.0 is 33 percent smaller than the WHOOP 3.0.
18:58 – New Battery. The battery inside the WHOOP 4.0 is groundbreaking silicon anode technology that has never before been used commercially.
20:45 – Waterproof Battery Pack. The WHOOP 4.0 is waterproof, and now the WHOOP battery pack is too. “We went back to the drawing board and said ’How do we make this water tight?’ And the big thing we couldn’t get around was how do you charge the WHOOP 4.0 If you need some contacts to pass electricity through to charge the battery? And so what we did was use another groundbreaking technology, wireless charging.”",9/10/21

0:26 – A New Era of WHOOP. “This is truly an exciting day in the history of WHOOP,” Will says. “We [have] announced our biggest, most ambitious technology release in WHOOP history, WHOOP 4.0, and all the technology and software and apparel to go with it.”
2:54 – WHOOP Body. “WHOOP Body featuring Anywhere Technology is truly a revolution for the wearable industry. I think it goes back to something [Will has] always said, that wearable technology should be cool or disappear,” John says. “With WHOOP you can dress it up or now with [4.0] you can truly make it disappear by embedding it into some of our smart garments.”
3:45 – A New Way to Wear WHOOP. “What we found actually in some of the research we’ve been developing for a long time, is that sometimes by putting [WHOOP] on your bicep, you can get even better accuracy depending on the activities you’re doing. So we took that idea and started looking at what other locations around the body could you put a WHOOP sensor. We’ve mapped out 10 to 20 different locations [where WHOOP can be worn.]”
6:21 – SpO2. WHOOP will now track your SpO2 levels with the 4.0. “Sp02, also known as blood oxygen, is very important because it gives you an idea of how much oxygen your blood is carrying. Normally humans will be 95-100% oxygenated. … There’s tremendous health monitoring implications. With the COVID pandemic, we saw a lot of people buying pulse-oximeters because we know COVID wreaked havoc on your blood oxygen levels.”
7:50 – Daily SpO2 Monitoring. “If you walk into a doctor’s office for an annual checkup, the first thing they do is stick a pulse oximeter on your finger, or to get your pulse-ox and to get your resting heart rate. Now WHOOP is effectively going to be able to measure those things 24/7,” Will says.",9/10/21

Our community-wide data also showed us which behaviors most positively and negatively affected both recovery and sleep efficiency. In addition, we saw a direct correlation between mental well-being and sleep across the WHOOP population.

We are examining what WHOOP data can tell us about the Omicron variant of COVID-19. Omicron cases are rising across the globe–accounting for 95% of the reported cases in the US.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, WHOOP has been conducting research to better understand how COVID can affect sleep and recovery, what physiological response vaccines produce, and perhaps most importantly, how COVID affects respiratory rate. Our latest WHOOP research shows that with the Omicron variant, like previous strains of the virus, COVID-19 infections often coincide with an increase in respiratory rate.
WHOOP VP of Data Science and Research Emily Capodilupo returns to the podcast to detail our findings, which include new information indicating that men may experience a more significant respiratory rate spike than women. WHOOP is also seeing that many people experience a respiratory rate dip below baseline after the increase. We also found that respiratory rate with Omicron returned to baseline faster than with earlier variants for both men and women.

Our VP or Performance, Kristen Holmes, sits down with Dr. Michele Lastella, a researcher in sleep, sexual activity, and athletic performance, for an in-depth discussion on how sexual activity plays a role in your sleep quality, your physiology, and your emotional wellbeing.
Dr. Lastella is a true expert in this field, with one of his primary areas of research focusing specifically on the relationship between sex and sleep. He has authored over 60 papers covering sexual activity, sleep, recovery, sport psychology, and athletic performance, and his 2019 study found that both men and women perceive that they fall asleep quicker (and sleep better) after orgasm with a partner, or alone.
Kristen and Dr. Lastella discuss what happens physiologically and psychologically during and after sex, what sleep latency is and how sex can reduce it, and the role sexual activity plays in longevity. They also talk about the differences between sex with a partner vs. masturbation, and how libido changes over time and why sleep might be the key to keeping your drive higher.
Plus, we reveal which age groups on WHOOP have the most sex, which states report the most sex, and how events like the Super Bowl and Valentine’s Day affect the instances of our members’ reported sexual activity.

Robert Moeller, a long-time Navy SEAL and our Associate Vice President of Government, sits down with Coast Guard Commander Scott Austin for a discussion on leadership, performance, and how data can be used to help our servicemen and women. Commander Austin is a helicopter pilot based in Port Angeles, Washington. He has spent 18 years in the Coast Guard in a variety of different roles, including search and rescue, counter-terrorism, and narcotics interdiction.
Commander Austin recently completed a study of Coast Guard members that evaluated how crew member perceptions of fatigue and alertness compared with WHOOP data on sleep and recovery. He discusses why the sleep deprivation culture is one of our greatest threats to the safety of military personnel, the stressors and fatigue Coast Guard aviators experience on a daily basis, plus what some of their search and rescue missions are like and how the Coast Guard plays a role in our nation’s defense.

Kristen Holmes and Emily Capodiulupo return for a discussion with Dr. Shon Rowan from West Virginia University about a first-of-its-kind study with WHOOP. This study followed women throughout the course of their pregnancy to understand the physiological impact of pregnancy and exercise.
The research revealed that participants experienced an increase in resting heart rate and a decrease in heart rate variability for much of their pregnancies, but saw a bounce back in those metrics in the weeks before birth. The participants also reported higher HRV scores postpartum compared to their heart rate variability baseline before pregnancy.

Adam Thielen was a 4-sport star in high school, but didn’t get any interest from major college programs. He was offered a $500 football scholarship from Division II Minnesota State. It wasn’t even enough to cover books, but he took the scholarship anyway and became a standout player.
Still, Adam went mostly unnoticed. He wasn’t picked in the NFL draft, but his hometown Vikings offered him a spot at a rookie camp. Adam defied the odds, working his way onto the roster in a special teams role. Nine years later, he is an All-Pro receiver and is one of the most recognizable players in the NFL.
Adam discusses the mental side of performance and how he took advantage of every small opportunity he was given along the way, what he’s learned about injury prevention, and his approach to recovery.

Kristen Holmes sits down with neurophysiologist Louisa Nicola for an in-depth discussion on peak performance, brain health, athletics, and longevity.
Louisa was a triathlete who represented Australia at the world championships, but found her way to neuroscience after being hit by a car while she was training on a bike. She discovered the mind-body connection as part of her rehab, which led her to founding her company Neuro Athletics a few years later. Louisa has since gone on to work with some of the best athletes across baseball, basketball, and more to ensure their mental game is just as strong as their physical game.
Louisa details the intersection between brain health, physiology, and peak performance; the role sleep, nutrition, and exercise play in growing our brains; and how the brain ages and the steps we can take to keep our brains young. She also explains how sleep deprivation leads to a higher risk of injuries and a weakened immune system, and how focussing on your hydration is one of the best ways to stay on top of your game.

We chat about the “WHOOP gang” they’ve formed among WWE wrestlers, including how they compete for the best data each day, the discoveries they’ve made from wearing it, and the ways it helps them adapt their training and be better recovered.
Additionally, we discuss the natural similarities between wrestling and CrossFit, things they do to improve their HRV, and how the strain of a match compares to a hard workout.
There’s some great behind-the-scenes stuff here too on what pro wrestling is really like, including an absurd travel schedule, how the storytelling can adapt and change from match to match, and why being in the ring is similar to dancing the tango.
Even if you’re not a fan or wrestling, I think you’ll find a lot to learn from these amazing athletes.

Lachlan Morton’s accomplishments on the bike are truly legendary. He’s raced in some of the biggest world tour events, but he’s perhaps best known for his achievements in ultra long distance and uphill events. Lachlan recently set the world record in “Everesting,” climbing the equivalent of Mount Everest (29,000 feet), in just 7-and-a-half hours. He also conquered the Tour de France route last summer by himself, riding 12 hours a day, sleeping in tents alongside the road, and raising $700,000 for charity in the process.
Lachlan sits down with WHOOP resident cycling expert Jeremy Powers to discuss his journey to the sport and what he’s learned throughout his career, the toll the Tour de France route took on his body and what his WHOOP data looked like, and why perspective and gratitude are key components of success.

This week on the WHOOP podcast, CEO Will Ahmed is joined by WHOOP SVP of Data Science & Research, Emily Capodilupo to talk all things alcohol. As many WHOOP members already know, alcohol has a deleterious effect on the body, lowering HRV, RHR, and subsequently recovery scores, while also reducing sleep quality. But recent data shows just how much every incremental drink consumed affects your physiology. Emily shares more about why that is – and she also dives into WHOOP data published in Frontiers that found sleep and alcohol use were significantly different on the majority of US public holidays.

podcast-2-kevin-kit-parker-mad-scientist-harvard,"Podcast No. 2: Kevin Kit Parker, Mad Scientist of Harvard","My guest today on the WHOOP Podcast is Kevin Kit Parker.
Kit is the Tarr Family Professor of Bioengineering and Applied Physics at Harvard, director of the SEAS Disease Biophysics Group, and a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve.
I first met Kit in 2013 because he taught Aurelian Nicolae, co-founder at WHOOP, while Aurelian was at Harvard. Kit and I bonded over the concept of improving sleep and recovery within the Department of Defense (how can we make soldiers sleep better and recover faster?), and he soon after became an advisor to WHOOP. Given Kit served multiple combat tours in Afghanistan, as well two missions as part of the Gray team investigating traumatic brain injuries, our mission to improve human performance was close to his heart.
Kit is literally the mad scientist at Harvard–his lab creates some of the wildest and most innovative projects you can imagine. You have to listen to understand what I mean.
Our conversation includes a variety of amazing topics including how to optimize your vacation, the science of counterinsurgency, how your body handles being in a firefight, designing fashion that humans are neurologically wired to enjoy, building the country’s best BBQ smoker, and dinner with Kanye West and Larry Paige.
I expected my conversation with Kit to be highly entertaining and he certainly delivered! I hope you enjoy.",12/12/18

Marcus also has a degree in molecular and cell biology from the University of California, Berkeley. He left medical school to focus instead on helping people be more fit and live healthier lives.
Marcus and I discuss his background in athletics, from his time as a high school soccer goalie to his rapid ascension to the top of the CrossFit world, and how that led to what he does today. From there we dive into his training methods and philosophies, how he evaluates fitness over time, diet and nutrition, his sleeping habits, and much more.
We also explore how WHOOP helps him to be a better athlete, coach, business owner and father, as well as how he uses it with his clients. Whether you’re an athlete or not, I think you’ll find Marcus’ insight into healthier living to be very beneficial, and we’re thrilled to have him as one of our long-time members.

WHOOP Founder and CEO Will Ahmed is joined by WHOOP Chief Technology Officer Jaime Waydo to share more on this revolutionary new feature, including how it was developed, what the R&D process was like, how it changes Strain scores, and the impact it has on your recovery and training recommendations.

Neen’s story is a fascinating one. A serious knee injury at 28 years old made him realize he was throwing away his career drinking and partying. Now 33, he hasn’t had a drop in four-and-a-half years, and his career is reaching new heights.

We also discuss what makes him a high-performance athlete and everything he does to maintain that, plus his goals going forward and how he plans to extend his career as long as possible.

Ebenezer is a certified strength and conditioning specialist with a degree in journalism from Syracuse University. He began his career as a sports reporter for the New York Daily News, where he learned a great deal from the athletes he covered about fitness, training, and recovering from injury. He’s also been a WHOOP member for the past two years.
Eb and I talk about what it’s like to interview pro athletes and how he’s used that to improve his own fitness, his biggest messages when it comes to smart and healthy training, and the various gyms and classes he visits in NYC to keep up with all the latest trends. We then explore how he likes to put these theories to the test through self-experimentation and using WHOOP to quantify the effect they have on his body.
As a journalist and trainer who’s also the fitness director for one of the world’s premier health and lifestyle magazines, I think Eb has a unique perspective that athletes of all levels and abilities can learn from.

As a national-champion field hockey coach at Princeton University, Kristen developed several methods and philosophies for sustaining success on an elite level, enabling her teams to win 12 league titles in 13 seasons. Mike is a Princeton grad himself and a former Olympic rowing coach who’s guided a number of athletes to great achievements as well.
Kristen and Mike discuss the idea that winning is a choice, and how to instill that mindset in athletes. This includes concepts like always playing as if the score is 0-0, and ignoring the names of each upcoming opponent to avoid “trap games.” They also dive into the psychological factors that influence performance, and the role WHOOP data plays in all of this.

Ginny took up rifle shooting after hunting with her grandfather at age 14. Five years later, she was an Olympic champion. It’s a fascinating sport to learn about, and the effort and concentration needed to repeatedly hit a bullseye only half a millimeter wide is astonishing.
Ginny and I talk about the dedication and mindset necessary to go from beginner to world champ in just 5 years, and what she did to stay focused while competing at the Olympic Games. Additionally, we discuss how her research as a West Virginia University student led to her getting on WHOOP, and how she’s used it to steady her shooting by improving her HRV and lowering her resting heart rate.

Happy New Year, everyone! On today’s podcast we explore what you can learn about your body from a year on WHOOP. Mike Lombardi and Emily Capodilupo break down the data from the first-ever Annual Performance Assessment we just sent out to all our members–a summary of your year on WHOOP.
Mike and Emily talk about things like: What day of the week are people the most recovered? What days do they usually take on the most strain? How much does the average WHOOP member actually sleep per night, and what behaviors affect their sleep the most? Plus, what can you discover by examining your training patterns and the impact they have on your body over the course of an entire year?
For WHOOP members, this podcast will give you some amazing insight into the data you’ve just received. And even if you’re not on WHOOP, there’s a lot you can learn here about human behavior and how the body responds to the choices we make.

It’s a customizable component that allows you to log specific things that may impact your performance on a daily basis. There are more than 40 behaviors you can track across lifestyle, nutrition, supplements, medication, sleep, recovery and more. Women can also now follow how pregnancy and menstruation are affecting them.
Your privacy is critical to us here at WHOOP, so it’s important to note that this feature is for your eyes only.
Kristen Holmes and Emily Capodilupo join me for an in-depth discussion on what we can learn from tracking these states and behaviors.

Here at WHOOP, we are inspired by the work of doctors, nurses and medical professionals, especially during these trying times.
Our guest today is Dr. Jamie Coleman, a Denver-based trauma surgeon. When Jamie isn’t saving lives, she is also a professor, writer, and media health expert.
We discuss what it’s like to work in the male-dominated field of surgery, how a matter of minutes or even seconds can be the difference between life and death, the physical, mental, and emotional toll her line of work takes, balancing her busy career with raising two children, and how WHOOP enables her to be better at everything she does.
Jamie is also leading a study that uses WHOOP to understand the sleep and recovery patterns of trauma surgeons. It’s her goal to improve her colleagues’ lives and help them better manage the effects of long shifts, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Many trauma surgeons are affected deeply by what they encounter at work on a daily basis and we’re proud to be working with Jamie on this journey.
Stay tuned after our discussion with Jamie for some listener questions. You ask, we have answers!

We have been gathering information on coronavirus via the all-new WHOOP Journal and we have already obtained fascinating insights into this terrible disease.
WHOOP is investigating a potential connection between changes in respiratory rate and COVID-19 symptoms. We believe that a noticeable increase in respiratory rate is a measurable precursor of coronavirus symptoms based on individual cases that we have seen in our data. We are studying this possible link with our research partners in an effort to better understand this current health crisis.

We also talk about his time in the Navy, including when he knew he was going to become a SEAL, what he went through to make it happen, SEAL training Hell Week, the experience of his first mission and the mindset needed to achieve success, as well as some funny stories around team building and brotherhood.
In Part 2 we recap the event, looking at what was necessary for Moe and the other SEALs to cross the finish line, what they saw in their WHOOP data, and what they’ll do in 2019 to somehow take it up a notch.

Chris is a remarkable person, an elite athlete, and a true trailblazer in the world of sports. He was the first trans man to make a U.S. national team, a feat he accomplished in 2015 when he earned a spot on Team USA’s sprint duathlon team. But before he could compete, Chris had to challenge the International Olympic Committee’s policy on trans athletes. He served as the catalyst for the eventual change in IOC rules.
The first trans athlete to ever compete at the Olympic Trials in any sport, Chris is now a 6-time member of Team USA. He was also the first trans athlete to be featured in his own Nike commercial and to appear in the ESPN Body Issue.
Chris discusses the many challenges he faced, and overcame, throughout his life. He and Kristen also touch on a number of difficult issues, including substance abuse and the prevalence of suicide in the trans youth community.
I think you’ll take a lot away from this episode and we appreciate Chris’ willingness to share his story.

“We all have but one death to spend, and insofar as it can have any meaning it finds it in the service of comrades-in-arms.
And yet, I deny that I died FOR anything – not my Country, not my Army, not my fellow man, none of these things. I LIVED for these things, and the manner in which I chose to do it involved the very real chance that I would die in the execution of my duties.
I knew this, and accepted it, but my love for West Point and the Army was great enough – and the promise that I would someday be able to serve all the ideals that meant anything to me through it was great enough – for me to accept this possibility as a part of a price which must be paid for all things of great value. If there is nothing worth dying for – in this sense – there is nothing worth living for.
I lived a full life in the Army, and it has exacted the price. It is only just.”

WHOOP Sleep performance metrics give great insight to mental wellness and clarity. Among other things, sleep is a proven memory aid. Research shows that sleep prior to studying makes space for new material. Additionally, sleeping after studying helps prevent forgetting the new information (Mazza, et al., 2016).
While you are asleep, your body restores and repairs the brain, which facilitates the recalibration and healthy function of biological systems. It also allows for detoxification. Using WHOOP to quantify your REM, deep sleep, light sleep and awake phases throughout the night will help gauge how well your brain is repairing. This data lets you understand the strengths and weaknesses of your sleep and how improving your sleep hygiene will ultimately benefit your recovery and mental health the next day.
You can also use the WHOOP Journal feature to see how changes to your diet and exercise regimen affect your metrics.

positive-body-image-mental-health,"Your Positive Body Image: Nutrition, Exercise and Sleep for Mental Health","## How to Create Your Positive Body Image
Hint: It doesn’t start on the scale.
Positive body image starts with accepting where you are. It’s healthy to have goals to reach towards, but in order to appreciate those soon-to-be accomplishments, we must love who we are right now. If we don’t love who we are now, we aren’t going to love a 5-pound-lighter version of ourselves. It’s rooted deeper than that.
Your body image is primarily shaped by your self-talk. When you look in the mirror, what type of thoughts come to mind? Are they positive? Negative? It can be easy to fall into the spiraling negative self-talk.
The good news is, you have control over that voice in your head and can start reshaping it at any moment. Here’s a great tool to practice positive self-talk and strengthen your inner voice: Wake up in the morning and reflect on 3 things you love about your body. The trick is to come up with 3 new things each morning for the entire week. Challenge yourself to continue this exercise for 4 weeks and watch the self-talk evolve.
For many of us, a positive body image plays a significant role in contributing to our overall mental health. The right nutrition, exercise and sleep are all key factors as well.",5/13/20

predict-covid-19-risk,Leveraging WHOOP Technology to Predict COVID-19 Risk,"Implications
WHOOP is not a medical product, and this study certainly doesn’t imply that those nasal swabs we’re in such short supply of are a thing of the past, rather it’s meant to demonstrate the power of continuous monitoring to leverage valuable information contained in subclinical changes in respiratory rate.
“For the first time, we have shown that elevated respiratory rate, when compared to an individuals’ normal baseline, can be used to discriminate in some cases between people who test positive for COVID-19 and those who test negative,” said Professor Greg Roach, Head of Sleep & Circadian Physiology Research, CQUniversity.
Because medical screening of everyone every day is impractical, our study suggests that wearable-based solutions can serve as a useful tool to fill the gap between the ideal and reality, and give potentially infected individuals a valuable heads up that if heeded can prevent unnecessary continued community spread.",6/22/20
predict-covid-19-risk,Leveraging WHOOP Technology to Predict COVID-19 Risk,"Changes in Respiratory Rate As an Early Warning of COVID-19
The graph below shows the average percent change in respiratory rate from baseline by day relative to symptom onset (shaded in blue, notice the spike prior to this point). We found that in 20% of pre-symptomatic infected individuals, the rise in respiratory rate prior to symptom onset can be identified before they even know they are sick.
The average percent change in respiratory rate from baseline by day relative to symptom onset
## Why is This Finding Important?
### NON-INVASIVE, EARLY DETECTION
NON-INVASIVE, EARLY DETECTION
The finding that respiratory rate may deviate from baseline before we start to feel sick means it can potentially be leveraged to help keep others safe, by letting infected people know they might be capable of spreading COVID-19 so that they can socially distance. This is particularly exciting because WHOOP – which is to date the only wearable that has been validated by a third party clinical trial to accurately measure respiratory rate – can do so non-invasively and unobtrusively, by automatically taking measurements while you sleep each night, making monitoring this important vital sign extremely easy.
### A SAFER RETURN TO WORK
A SAFER RETURN TO WORK
This finding is particularly exciting because COVID-19 is actually most contagious in the 2 days before symptom onset. A common option many companies are exploring as they build out return-to-work strategies is to screen for fevers at the door and send home employees with elevated temperatures. Such an approach would likely be effective in removing some contagious employees from the workplace, but by definition is at the earliest catching people at symptom onset and therefore after contagiousness has already started to go down. On top of that, taking someone’s temperature at work means that they have already commuted into work and been in contact with colleagues and others, which increases the likelihood of spreading the virus.",6/22/20

There is still more work to be done–the data we’ve been able to collect so far has been limited to symptomatic cases, so follow up research is required to understand if respiratory rate monitoring can aid in the detection of fully asymptomatic cases. Additionally, global shortages of testing limited the number of COVID-19 tested samples available for algorithm development and validation, as COVID-19 tests become more available WHOOP will continue to collect data and anticipates having access to more COVID-19 verified samples with which to refine this algorithm.
At WHOOP, we’re committed to providing our members with scientifically sound research and a product that helps everyone continuously monitor themselves.

Just over three months ago, I woke up to a message from a colleague showing me that one of our members had posted on social media about contracting COVID-19, and how his vital signs, as measured by WHOOP, had changed. One of the most dramatic differences we saw was in his respiratory rate. Not only did it jump an extraordinary amount, but his respiratory rate started rising during incubation before he realized he was sick.
It became clear we needed to dig further into why that might be happening, so we enlisted our partners at Australia’s Central Queensland University to understand if this unusual observation was an anomaly or a useful early warning sign of COVID-19.
WHOOP has submitted a manuscript for peer review and publication on the utility of wearable technology in providing early warning signs of potential COVID-19 infections. We believe this is a first-of-its kind submission for a maker of commercially available wearable technology.
Over the past few months, WHOOP members have shared via our Journal feature their diagnoses of COVID-19, as well as many instances where suspected cases of COVID-19 resulted in negative tests. Using that data, we were able to derive an algorithm capable of identifying 80% of symptomatic COVID-19 cases simply from examining changes in respiratory rate from each member’s personal baseline.",6/22/20

For me, pregnancy has brought many challenges in trying to hold on to all the ways in which sport adds to my life. Observers who peer into moments of my journey often ask “Don’t you want to take it easy for a bit?” However, what they don’t understand is that I’m not on a quest to be a pregnant superhero, I’m merely trying to hold on to the bits of me that bring fulfillment and joy in order to temper the hardships and lows that pregnancy can bring along with it.
There are times when those voices suggesting I take it easy get inside my head. I contend that no one cares more about the health of the baby than its mother, so despite wanting to hold on to “me,” it would never be at the risk of my baby’s health.
For this reason, my WHOOP has been an integral tool in my pregnant journey from the beginning. Seeing the trend of my elevated resting heart rate data is what first prompted me to realize I could be pregnant around four weeks.
An increase in resting heart rate From her normal baseline made Laura think she might be pregnant.
The ability to monitor my key health indicators each day and see a rating affixed to my effort (strain) has armed me with confidence that I know my body best and have the numbers to back it up.
WHOOP has also motivated me on days where motivation is lacking. Sometimes that looks like getting out for a supplemental walk, snowshoe, or backcountry ski lap with my family to increase my strain when I know my body can handle it.
Other days my recovery score has motivated me to take on a workout when I’m dragging, or boosted me to feeling on top of the world for achieving an elusive 20+ strain, all the while a human is growing inside of me at the same time (cue, badass superwoman feelings).

Throughout the journey of pregnancy and motherhood, there’s a lot of self reflection and questioning of “Can I do it?” Maybe it’s the labor and delivery, or just knowing how to be a good mom, there are a host of questions and anxieties around this experience.
The daily practice of asking myself this same question in my physical endeavors gives me the confidence that I will put forth my best effort. That and the reward of a cookie as big as my face at the summit.

pregnancy-endurance-training-exercise,Pregnancy is an Endurance Event & WHOOP is Helping Me Track It,"Pregnancy is an endurance event. Much like a marathon or an endurance bike event, there’s the anticipation, excitement and nerves of the start line. It may feel easy to begin, or it may be an off day and the body just doesn’t seem to be cooperating. However it might kick off, an endurance event is rarely without its mental, physical and emotional highs and lows, and pregnancy is no different.
“How are you feeling?” is the most frequent question asked of pregnant women and I’ve long struggled to honestly answer it. Is the person really seeking to understand the complexity of my answer, or merely looking for a way to politely initiate conversation and then move onto a new topic? I generally assume the latter, so my inner voice stifles my deeper honesty knowing that it would likely overwhelm them.
Pregnant with her second child, Laura enjoys elevating her WHOOP strain on a regular basis.
What is my true answer? That response vacillates from day to day and swings wildly–from feeling like a badass superwoman, to the desperate longing for my normal body and to feel like my regular self again with the end so far out of sight. When you’re deep in the throes of an endurance feat, it’s almost impossible to reflect on the future feelings of joy and elation at the finish.
I wouldn’t define myself as simply a fitness enthusiast or endorphin seeker. I identify with both those descriptions and yet my endurance pursuits have brought so much more to my life than just a strong body or a short-lived high. My community, my career, my husband, and daily ways to fulfill my achiever personality were all found through endurance sport, namely, cycling.",3/8/22
pregnancy-endurance-training-exercise,Pregnancy is an Endurance Event & WHOOP is Helping Me Track It,"And most importantly as a type A athlete, WHOOP has granted me permission to take a day off, to prioritize my rest and recovery especially when pregnancy is akin to baseline endurance training, even without additional activity and strain. I see the proof in the numbers–a heightened resting heart rate or a plummeting HRV translates to a low recovery score and gives me assurance of what my body is requesting.
I rode close to 5,000 miles through my first pregnancy and carried and delivered a healthy baby girl to term. This time around I am armed with more confidence from how I make decisions in regards to my physical activity and how I minimize risk in relation to the human body’s astounding efficiencies and adaptations during exercise alongside pregnancy.
Among one of those adaptations is that pregnancy reduces normal body temperature and lowers the temperature at which sweating happens (more sweat equals the ability to more efficiently dissipate body heat). Hormones increase blood vessel dilation which brings more blood flow to the skin and aids in allowing the body to dissipate heat through the skin.
Skin temperature In the WHOOP health monitor is one of several metrics Laura is tracking during her pregnancy.
Since thermoregulation is one of the key concerns for intense exercise while pregnant, it’s advantageous that your body is creating more cooling efficiencies. The WHOOP 4.0 monitors my skin temperature throughout the night and I can check my health monitor stats in the morning for a daily assessment.",3/8/22

But, when the annual California Coast Ride planning came around on the calendar—500 miles from San Francisco to LA in the span of 4 days—this was one of the first major endurance challenges I wasn’t sure was physically feasible. I would be riding alongside a 12-person pro level peloton after training mostly indoors through Vermont winter.
My decision to take part in this challenge at 19 weeks pregnant came only with serious self contemplation and a mental self-psychology assessment. I needed to ready my mind and body to accept whatever I was capable of on the day. Maybe it’d mean finishing a portion of the ride and getting in the support car halfway through. That admittedly wouldn’t have been an option for my stubborn non-pregnant self, but this time around I was able to manage my expectations with the outlook that any miles in the sunshine with friends would be soul-filling.

To my amazement and pleasure, Baby King granted me the fulfillment of riding the full 500 miles with the highest strain scores I’ve seen during my pregnancy. Admittedly, it took a monumental ask of my physical and mental resources to pedal every one of those miles (as evidenced by my multiple recovery scores in the red), but what it took out of me it also gave back to me.
Red recoveries didn’t stop Laura from completing a 4-day, 500-mile ride.
The term “strain” likely doesn’t evoke mental images of peace and joy. But for me, my WHOOP strain score is akin to my joy-meter. It’s a reminder that despite all that is changing with my physical body and life, I still am strong and capable.

Giving birth is a physically traumatic event, and it’s incredibly important to patiently allow your body to heal. After delivery, your body has permanent structural changes, often in your hips, back, and feet. If you rush your return to movement, you are not allowing yourself the required time to re-learn proper biomechanics in your new body.
So while I was excited to get back to training after delivering my son, I was surprised by how taxing walking, getting up out of a chair, and even going to the bathroom were in the first few days after delivery. Instead of attempting to begin working out right away, I used the first 10 days postpartum to enjoy the time with my new baby.
After my initial healing had begun, I started integrating pelvic floor exercises and core compressions. Just as these are important during pregnancy, they are also important postpartum to help avoid incontinence, diastasis recti, and prolapse.
But, the most pleasant surprise was how quickly my WHOOP numbers bounced back. Even though sleeping with a newborn was challenging, my sleep was far less disrupted by my baby than it was by my pregnant body. Without the added strain of carrying a baby, my RHR and HRV quickly rebounded, leading to a week of green recoveries:
## Pregnancy Insights and Understanding Your Body
I’m now 6 weeks postpartum and starting to feel more like my old self. When I look back at my pregnancy, I love that I was able to track so much of what my body was experiencing by using my WHOOP. While not everyone is an elite athlete, and each pregnancy is different, listening to your body can really help you feel connected to the process and better understand what you are going through physiologically.
For me, this helped me have patience, understanding, and love for how my body was performing. I hope this can help give you some insight into what to expect if you are lucky enough to embark on a parenthood journey yourself!",9/18/20

I was especially excited to track the physiological effect on my body during the delivery of my baby. How would the pain translate to strain? Would I have a spike in heart rate while pushing?
For all the pregnant athletes out there, you’ll be happy to hear that being physically fit absolutely prepares you for delivery. In fact, strength and fitness has been shown to contribute to smoother delivery and faster delivery times (in one study, by an average of three hours)!
The delivery stage of my labor lasted 50 minutes. When asked to evaluate how this physical effort compared to other training experiences, I would describe it as repeated maximal lift efforts with an even work-to-rest ratio. Each pushing effort is relatively short (30 to 60 seconds) and then you rest until your next contraction (usually about a minute), so it felt much more like a weighted workout than a cardiovascular effort. My WHOOP strain reflected this and my heart rate never raised above 110 bpm. And yes, I logged delivery as “wrestling”:
I also chose to get an epidural, which dramatically improved my body’s ability to relax during labor and delivery. This allowed me to take several naps while I was laboring in order to store up the energy required for delivery. Even with a lot of building excitement, these naps made a huge difference in keeping me feeling refreshed.",9/18/20
pregnancy-heart-rate-data-trends,"WHOOP Pregnancy Data: Trends in Resting Heart Rate, HRV, Strain, Sleep & More","Working Out While Pregnant: Adapting Through the Trimesters
Not very long ago ago the exercise recommendation for pregnant women was to engage in low intensity cardiovascular efforts. Many obstetricians would also suggest maintaining a heart rate of under 140 beats per minute. However, new research has suggested that pregnant women are safe to continue participating in physical activities they engaged in prior to pregnancy, and high intensity exercise can be beneficial in low risk pregnancies.
Throughout my pregnancy, I chose to closely listen to what my body could handle. As my body changed, so did my level of activity and the exercises that felt comfortable.
### FIRST TRIMESTER (0-12 WEEKS):
In my first trimester, my aerobic capacity noticeably plummeted. It became much harder for me to maintain a comfortably elevated heart rate, which makes sense considering my increased cardiac output and initial surge of hormones. I chose to focus on strength workouts with a lot of built in rest so that I could allow my heart rate to decrease between sets. Because my bump was still very small during this phase, there weren’t many movements I felt I needed to scale yet.
There were also incredible waves of fatigue that came in my first trimester, so I began to take off days whenever my body asked for one.
### SECOND TRIMESTER (13-26 WEEKS):
The second trimester was my favorite period of the pregnancy. By this time, I had a cute pregnant bump and my first trimester nausea had disappeared. My aerobic capacity also felt like it had returned a bit, making it much easier to add back in more cardiovascular efforts.
This period of time also coincided with the COVID-19 quarantine, so it was necessary to get creative about workouts with limited equipment. I chose to focus on 20-40 minute workouts consisting of both cardiovascular and weighted efforts.",9/18/20
pregnancy-heart-rate-data-trends,"WHOOP Pregnancy Data: Trends in Resting Heart Rate, HRV, Strain, Sleep & More","PREGNANCY CONING
As many pregnant women experience during this phase, I began to notice coning during some exercises. Coning is when your abdomen looks like a cone, with the peak being along the middle line of your abdomen, also known as the linea alba. Coning tends to occur when you add substantial pressure to your abdomen through certain exercises, or even just when you sit up to get out of bed. If coning isn’t avoided, it can contribute to the development of diastasis recti, or the separation of the rectus abdominis muscles.
To account for this, I began avoiding all core work on my back, pull-ups, and rowing. I decreased my amount of running and jumping which contributed to pelvic pressure. Finally, I adjusted my deadlift stance from a standard position to a sumo stance to accommodate my growing belly.
### THIRD TRIMESTER (27 WEEKS-DELIVERY):
In the final few months of my pregnancy, my baby had grown considerably in size. This made me a lot more uncomfortable, especially near my ribs and pelvic floor. In fact, I know women who have broken ribs from the pressure their baby places on their torso. Needless to say, it became much harder to breathe toward the end of pregnancy.
For these reasons, I began adding in shorter workouts with more rest. Most of my sessions lasted about 20 minutes, and I relied on walking and biking to contribute to some of my low intensity cardiovascular efforts.
I also focused on preparing my pelvic floor and core by practicing core compressions in all of my workout warmups and cool-downs. Strengthening these areas is critical to a smooth vaginal delivery and recovery. If I hadn’t been in quarantine during my third trimester, this is when I would have relied on a pelvic floor specialist for a physical therapy program. However, in this digital age, there are many fantastic online resources, like the Expecting and Empowered program.",9/18/20

When preparing for a child, you definitely hear about the lack of sleep you can expect once the baby arrives. However, what you don’t hear about as often is the sleep disruption you can expect throughout your pregnancy. My WHOOP data displayed quite a shift in my sleep patterns, especially during the first and third trimesters:
Nausea, hormones, and discomfort as you grow in size all contribute to sleep disruptions throughout the night. But I found that dehydration also played a part in my decreasing sleep quality. As your body mass increases, it becomes harder to regulate body temperature and meet your hydration requirement needs. In fact, most pregnant women do not reach these hydration needs.
My best bet became monitoring my water intake throughout the day, and moving all of my workouts indoors and into air conditioning. Pregnancy alone can lead to dehydration and sleep disturbances. A pregnancy with a third trimester during the summer makes that even harder. Then add a pregnancy during a global pandemic where masks are constantly required, and you can understand why it might be difficult to maintain hydration.",9/18/20
pregnancy-heart-rate-data-trends,"WHOOP Pregnancy Data: Trends in Resting Heart Rate, HRV, Strain, Sleep & More","Heart Rate During Pregnancy
For any given athlete, a decrease in resting heart rate (RHR) is associated with an improvement in fitness. An increase in heart rate variability (HRV) predicts your readiness to take on strain (cardiovascular exertion). But as a pregnant athlete, you can expect both of these metrics to trend in the opposite direction.
My resting heart rate quickly increased by over an average of 15 bpm in my first trimester, and most women see these changes within the first 2-5 weeks of pregnancy. But, my RHR also returned to normal levels just as rapidly. Within my first week postpartum, my RHR had dropped about 10 bpm.
This change in heart rate occurs to support the amount of blood pumped by the heart (cardiac output), which increases by 30-50% during pregnancy to match the needs of your growing baby.
## Pregnancy Resting Heart Rate Charts
My body’s ability to take on strain also trended down over time, which was displayed by a decrease in heart rate variability and daily WHOOP strain scores. The six months prior to becoming pregnant, my average HRV was 64, compared to the first six months of pregnancy when it dropped to an average of 50. As you can see in the chart below, my HRV climbed back up around my normal baseline almost immediately after giving birth (August 6).
## Heart Rate Variability During Pregnancy and Afterwards
While the change to my HRV didn’t surprise me, I found the decrease in strain to be very counterintuitive–I expected a harder-working body to mean higher strain numbers. However, the opposite was true.
Because my body was so focused on the task of growing another human, my ability to take on strain diminished. Before pregnancy, a day of high activity for me resulted in a strain score of at least 10 or more (WHOOP quantifies it on a 0-21 scale). During pregnancy, a day of high activity was often reflected in a WHOOP strain closer to 7:",9/18/20

As displayed above, the trends in HRV (down) and RHR (up) continued through most of pregnancy. However, 7 weeks before childbirth they reversed, with HRV beginning to rise and RHR starting to fall. This was a phenomenon never before detected by previous studies. With such a notable change happening in both metrics at this very specific point in the third trimester, it has the potential to be a useful barometer of how much time is remaining in the pregnancy.
Key Takeaway 2: This finding could enable physicians to watch out for these shifts in HRV and RHR trends, and in turn possibly take action if they happen sooner than expected.
## It’s Good for You to Get Exercise While Pregnant
Overall, the participants’ average minutes of logged daily activity did decrease during pregnancy, from about 28 minutes pre-pregnancy to 14 minutes by the third trimester. But, the women who were able to be more active had consistently improved HRV and RHR compared to those who were less active. This was particularly true in the first two trimesters of pregnancy and immediately following childbirth.
From Dr. Shon Rowan, lead researcher on the study: “Qualitative evidence suggests strong cultural expectations that women should ‘sit down and slow down’ during pregnancy. The guidelines for pregnant women around exercise have changed, but not in a wide-scale or well-known way. Contrary to past recommendations, this study found that any type of activity during pregnancy is beneficial. This isn’t necessarily driven by intensity, but duration.”

It is the first of its kind to track key biometrics with a wearable device throughout the participants’ entire pregnancy journey–before, during, and afterwards.
More than three years in the making, we are now pleased to share the results, which have been published in the scientific journal BioMed Central.
## HRV & Resting Heart Rate Trends in Active Pregnant Women
The goal of the study was to use continuous monitoring of heart rate variability (HRV) and resting heart rate (RHR) to define changes in normal pregnancies of physically active women, as well as to learn if increased levels of activity positively impacted these HR metrics.
In total, 38 women were enrolled in the study from March of 2019 until August 2020. They were each between 18 and 35 years old, and all exercising at least 3 times per week with the intention to continue doing so during pregnancy and afterwards. None were pregnant at the time, but all stated that they were hoping to be within the next 6 months.
From March of 2019 through June of 2021, WHOOP data was collected for 18 women from conception through delivery, for an average of 406 days. The women were all generally healthy over the course of their pregnancies, and each gave birth after 37-41 weeks.
## Changes In HRV & RHR Prior to First Missed Period
Almost immediately from the time of conception, the participants began to show a decrease in their heart rate variability and an increase in their resting heart rates. In the graphics below, you can see a significant dip in average HRV and bump in average RHR that culminate around the women’s first missed periods at 35 weeks prior to birth.

prehab-performance-reduce-risk-injury,Prehab Your Performance & Reduce the Risk of Injury,"Now this is not to say there is no value in subjective data, but it can only go so far when viewed alone. Think back to the runner in rehab scenario–what if they knew exactly when to push it or not? Maybe they were following a training schedule and had a big run planned that day despite a recovery in the red? If the injury was due to being over-strained or not recovered, couldn’t it have been avoided?
Prehab with WHOOP
With WHOOP, you can prehab your life. Here are a few instances of how that has worked for me.
Prior to using WHOOP, I had no idea hiking was so straining on my body. I’ve learned that I need to up the intensity of my training sessions in order to increase my tissue capacity to meet the demands of hiking.
When my daily WHOOP recovery is red or yellow, I fatigue much sooner during my workouts compared to when it is in the green. I know that injuries can occur when the tissue capacity cannot meet the physical demands, and that tissues are more vulnerable when fatigued or not properly warmed up. This has inspired me to adjust my running mileage, my 1RM% intensities, and my work-to-rest ratios during training sessions when my recovery isn’t great.
When I’m using the Strain Target and my workout goal is a high strain, I usually spend extra time with my warm-up to maximize my performance and ensure my body is prepared for that additional load.
Similarly, the WHOOP Sleep Planner also helps me with prehab. Sleep is one of the biggest modifiable risk factors when it comes to injury. I no longer have to guess how much sleep I need to be at my best. WHOOP tells me my optimal bed and wake times depending on if I just want to get by, perform, or peak the next day. I also now understand the sleep debt I accumulate after really hard training sessions, high-strain days, or even quick travel trips to teach.
All of this translates into the conversations I have with my rehab patients and my prehab education.",8/19/19
prehab-performance-reduce-risk-injury,Prehab Your Performance & Reduce the Risk of Injury,"Prehab originally started as a means to optimize surgical results with people literally doing rehab prior to surgery. Hospitals and doctors did their research and figured out that patients recovered faster when they went into surgery in better physical shape–from range of motion, to muscle strength, you name it. As we further understand the value of preventative medicine, prehab has now entered the world of physical fitness and athletic training as well.
Prehab varies for everyone. Of course you can’t go wrong with being physically fit, strong, and aerobically in shape, but prehab for a soccer player is going to look different than prehab for a firefighter. It all comes down to understanding the physical demands of your life, hobbies, sports, and other physical activities that put strain on your body. What are the common injuries associated with those physical tasks? Prehab consists of programming specific exercises to make sure your bones, ligaments, muscles, and tendons are capable of meeting these physical demands.
The value of data
So how can WHOOPers (Did I just make this up?!) use their data to their advantage when it comes to prehab? I have been on WHOOP for quite some time now, and simply put, life is no longer a guessing game. As a physical therapist, I’m very aware that there is substantial value in data, especially when it is objective.
For example, instead of just saying that was “a hard run” or “a tough leg workout,” I can actually see how much physical strain those activities put on my body (on a 0-21 scale). Additionally, I wake up knowing how ready my body is to perform at a physiologic level, and I can reflect on my sleep habits when I’m home versus when I’m on the road traveling and teaching. I can also now validate to my wife how straining simple things like golf can be on the body (I recently played a round that was a strain of 16+).",8/19/19
prehab-performance-reduce-risk-injury,Prehab Your Performance & Reduce the Risk of Injury,"No matter what type of athlete you are, staying healthy and able to perform is critical. As a treating physical therapist in an orthopedic and sports setting, I help patients rehab from overuse injuries that could often have easily been prevented. To understand how rehab (and prehab) works, you first have to understand how an injury occurs.
Why do injuries happen?
Two components of an injury are tissue capacity and activity overload. When the demands of an activity are greater than the tissue capacity the tissue will fail, and as a result an injury may occur. An easier way to imagine this is if you went to lift a 100-pound weight with a tool that had a lifting capacity of only 80 pounds, the tool is more than likely going to fail at completing the lift.
It’s a pretty simple concept, right? However, the issue is we don’t have easy-to-read capacity limits for our bones, ligaments, muscles and tendons that we can double check prior to an athletic endeavor or physical performance.
So with rehab patients, a lot of what I do is prescribe and monitor strain. Using the progressive-overload principle, the goal is to get the injured tissue’s capacity back to at least baseline, but ideally greater than 100% considering the tissue failed in the first place. If this individual wants to get back to running, but that’s what got them hurt in the first place, I have to investigate why.
What caused the injury? Was it an instantaneous moment of activity overload? Maybe chronic work overload? Or was the tissue capacity inferior to begin with? Could this individual not perform well enough to handle the strain?
This leads me to [p]rehab, something that I am educating patients on on a daily basis.

prevent-common-running-injuries,How to Prevent Common Running Injuries with Mobility and Strength Training,"According to Yale Medicine about 50% of runners get injured every year. These injuries include everything from IT band syndrome, to shin splints and stress fractures.
The most common questions I receive as a running coach almost always pertain to running-related injuries. Oftentimes people want an “easy fix,” like getting new shoes or resting for a few days. Trust me, I wish there was an easy fix. If so, I’d be a millionaire.
## What Causes Common Running Injuries?
From what I have seen over the years, the origin of most runner injuries is usually anatomic; issues stemming from muscle imbalances or weaknesses in the body that force other muscles to overcompensate in order to produce certain movement patterns (Example: Weak glutes causing the IT band to overwork). These muscle imbalances can also stem from a lack of range of motion (movement restriction), which puts stress on bones and joints and can lead to injuries.
My advice is, if you want to rehab an injury as well as avoid it in the future, you have to find the origin of the problem in order to fix the pain. If you don’t, it will continue to reoccur.
No shoes or rest day can repair your biomechanics. You have to do it yourself!",12/3/20
prevent-common-running-injuries,How to Prevent Common Running Injuries with Mobility and Strength Training,"Sleep, Recovery & WHOOP
I can’t stress enough how important it is to base your workouts on the quality of your sleep and recovery the night before. This is why I highly recommend WHOOP. It has truly been a game-changer in my own personal programming in terms of having an overall awareness of how recovered my body is and what type of strain my body is prepared for on that specific day.
When you workout, whether it’s sprints, weightlifting, or kettlebell training, the strain on your body causes tiny micro-tears in your muscle fibers (totally normal). It’s not until after you workout, when your body is resting (specifically during REM and deep sleep, the restorative stages of sleep) that it naturally begins to repair these muscle fiber tears in order to build stronger, leaner muscles.
If you don’t allow yourself proper sleep and recovery time you won’t be able to get stronger, faster, and healthier. Think about it like this: It’s the difference between working out on broken muscle fibers and never truly allowing them to recover, or working out on strong muscles which are fully recovered and ready to perform.
Through 24/7 heart rate monitoring, WHOOP measures the quality of your sleep and tracks the time you spend in restorative stages. Based on your sleep and other physiological biomarkers like resting heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate, WHOOP gives you a daily recovery score each morning. This serves as a recommendation for if your body is primed to take on high strain (intense workout), only moderate exercise, or if it needs to rest.
Programming your workouts based on recovery can be the difference between saving your body from an injury, or running into one (no pun intended, and check out How Often Should You Run?).

prevent-common-running-injuries,How to Prevent Common Running Injuries with Mobility and Strength Training,"Mobility and Strength are Essential to Prevent Running Injuries
Mobility is the way the human body moves, and the term “strength” can be defined as the body’s ability to produce certain movement patterns in a powerful and efficient way. While everybody moves a little differently, our bodies are all designed to function the same way. They are made up of the same bones, ligaments, muscles and joints, which are all connected and designed to produce functional and efficient movement patterns.
Runners can disrupt these natural movement patterns if their mechanics are restricted from either a lack of natural range of motion, or from underdeveloped muscles.
Although it may feel as though your legs are the only part of your body you use while running, there is actually much more to it! Your stride cycle requires proper hip function, as well as core and upper-body strength. Like I said before, the muscles and joints in our bodies are designed to work together. If certain muscles lack strength or if there is a restriction in movement anywhere, the whole system can be disrupted, which over time can result in injury (this falling stance drill is a great way to work on perfecting your stride).",12/3/20
prevent-common-running-injuries,How to Prevent Common Running Injuries with Mobility and Strength Training,"Warming Up: Dynamic vs. Static Stretching
Properly warming up your body requires dynamic movement. Too often, I see people simply static stretching before they run. Static stretching is when you stretch in place–like reaching down to your toes to stretch your hamstrings.
And sure, while it may feel good and likely loosens you up a bit, static stretching actually elongates your muscles and reduces their overall elasticity. In order to produce an efficient stride cycle (and to be able to do it for a while, like on long runs) your muscles need that elasticity to not only absorb the impact on your bones and joints when you land, but to also create the power and strength endurance running requires.
Static stretching is great for post-run, just not before.
Calf activation through bouncing on your toes helps get your body ready to fire the fast-twitch muscle fibers you need in order to pop off the ground in your stride.",12/3/20
prevent-common-running-injuries,How to Prevent Common Running Injuries with Mobility and Strength Training,"How to Prevent Runner’s Knee
Another common injury is runner’s knee. It’s a broad term used to describe the pain you feel in the front of your knee cap when doing things like bending, running, squatting, or walking down stairs.
Runner’s knee can be caused by a structural deficit, or can be a result of under-active glutes, which is why it’s so important for runners to incorporate strength training into their routine. I like to look at lean muscle (developed through strength training by doing movements like squats, and lateral lunges) as a cushion to your bones and joints. If you don’t have lean muscle to protect your bones and joints, the impact from running, over time, can cause wear and tear resulting in injuries like shin splints and stress fractures.
Spanish squats are an excellent corrective exercise to reduce knee compression in order to strengthen your glutes and help absorb the impact (shock absorption) on your knees while running.
## Ankle Strength is Imperative in Order to Run Efficiently
Shin splints, plantar fasciitis, and achilles tendon tightness can all stem from weak ankle strength or mobility, which can lead to the inability to properly fire your calf muscles (along with the rest of the muscles in your posterior chain) when you run.
Improving ankle strength not only helps you run faster and more economically, but also allows you to expend less energy to produce the same pace. Exercise-induced enhancement of your ankle’s ability to produce both dorsi and plantar flexion (plantar flexion is the ability to flex your foot up, and dorsiflexion is the ability to point your foot down toward the floor) improves overall strength in your ankle’s muscle-tendon capacities, which in turn enables you to run more efficiently and more powerfully.
I recommend the “ankle dance” to promote multi-directional movement, which is crucial for getting you out of the repetitive linear pattern required when running.",12/3/20
prevent-common-running-injuries,How to Prevent Common Running Injuries with Mobility and Strength Training,"IT Band Syndrome is One of the Most Common Running Injuries
IT band syndrome (ITBS) is one of the most common injuries amongst runners. It occurs when there is excessive overuse of the same pattern of movement. The IT band is made up of soft tissue, and runs along the outside of the thigh, from your hips to your knees. Inflammation from ITBS is usually a result of excessive rubbing over the tibial tubercle. It feels like an irritating tightness on the outside of the knee, and can cause inflammation and soreness in the hips as well.
Oftentimes, ITBS is a result of muscle imbalances or a lack of range of motion in your hips, glutes, or hamstrings (weak hip adductors or weak gluteus medius muscles, try this running gate drill to help). It can also be caused by increasing training volume (mileage) too quickly (too much sudden stress on the body).
Hip and core strength plays a major part in avoiding ITBS. Core strength stabilizes your trunk and pelvis, helping your posture stay strong when you run. If you have any weaknesses in your core or hips, or a lack of range of motion in your hips, it can cause a disruption to the normal functionality and purpose of your IT band.",12/3/20

What I quickly learned from WHOOP is that my Recovery was subpar, at best. I was failing to respect my Sleep Need, in particular with regard to the stress of frequent international travel for work. But, what I’ve found even more valuable is that WHOOP can allow me to assess the daily Strain, Sleep, and Recovery of my patients–it has been a fantastic clinical tool!
For example, last year it came to my attention that professional cyclist Lawson Craddock was struggling with declining performance, despite following a strict training regimen and nutrition plan. He was working harder and getting slower. While there were several variables in play, what it all boiled down to for Lawson was Overtraining Syndrome (OTS).",4/12/18
pro-athlete-sports-med-doctor-kevin-sprouse,Sports Med Doctor Shares How WHOOP is Instrumental to His Practice,"Many doctors struggle to figure out how best to motivate their patients to engage in daily physical activity. Not me.
As a Sports Medicine physician, I work with elite and professional athletes from multiple disciplines, as well as many hard-charging “weekend warriors.” The vast majority of my practice consists of advising and treating this demographic. I’m also the Head of Medicine for a World Tour professional cycling team, with athletes scattered across the United States, Europe, Australia and South America. Whether they are cyclists, triathletes, runners, golfers, obstacle course racers, baseball players, CrossFitters, or athletes from any other sport, my patients tend to go hard. In working with this driven athlete population, I focus not only on injury and illness treatment, but also on health, performance, and injury prevention. When I order blood tests, I’m often not looking for disease. Instead, I’m looking for early signs of imbalance, dietary deficiency and physiologic response to training stress. I evaluate lactate threshold profiles, continuous glucose monitors and training logs.
In my opinion, you can’t separate health from performance. A healthier athlete performs better, it’s that simple. Despite having many technological and scientific tools at my disposal, I have always struggled with how to quantify the time between training sessions. While many of my athletes are professionals, most are not. They train hard, but they also work hard. They are engaged students, employees, spouses and parents who bear the burdens of everyday life. I was able to see workout data from their daily training, but I was blinded to how the other 20+ hours of the day were impacting their bodies.",4/12/18

It never dipped below 110 over the last 150 kilometers, and maxed out at 193 bpm as he pushed for the finish line. Amazingly, amongst some normal cardiac drift, his heart rate actually trended upwards throughout the entire race.

Despite these impressive results, Scott says that qualifying for the tour in the first place is his greatest athletic achievement:
“I’m most proud of just getting through the qualifying school in 1994. There were 5,000 guys and only 50 made it. I was always right on the number [one stroke from missing the cut] at every stage. To make it through that pressure cooker and get my PGA tour card was probably my biggest accomplishment.”
On the PGA Tour in his late 40’s, Scott spent half his time playing and the other half as a broadcaster, for both the Golf Channel and FOX. When he turned 50, Scott became eligible for the Champions Tour, where he’s already won three times in less than a year.
When asked about the great start he’s had to what he refers to as his “second career,” Scott said “At 51, I’m in the best shape I’ve ever been in. The fact that my wife is a fitness instructor and a triathlete who’s always on the cutting edge has helped. On the Champions Tour, if you can stay in good shape you definitely have an advantage.”

pro-golfer-scott-mccarron-is-turning-back-the-clock-with-whoop,Pro Golfer Scott McCarron is Turning Back the Clock with WHOOP,"“I was reading a USA Today article about a San Francisco Giants relief pitcher who was a free agent. He was wondering if his new team was going to support WHOOP. That was the first I heard of it. Being a device that measure sleep and Day Strain, plus the idea that athletes who don’t get enough sleep after strenuous workouts have more of a chance to injure themselves, I thought it was really interesting. … I like working out, but over the years I’ve injured myself or pushed too hard on strenuous days. As a golfer you don’t have to be a powerlifter, you have to be flexible and strong. Sometimes we might push ourselves too hard when really we need rest.”
Scott got on the WHOOP system this past December and immediately started seeing the benefits:
“We travel so much, 26-28 weeks a year, through different time zones, it’s not always easy to get good sleep. Being able to monitor it is a huge advantage. Sometimes I used to wake up at 5 or 5:30 in the morning and I’d just get up. WHOOP tells me to go back to bed and get the sleep I need. The days [my Recovery is] in the green I feel more refreshed, golf feels good and workouts are easier. The days I’m in the red I’m definitely tired. WHOOP has made me more aware, and once you start going with it everything falls into place.”
“Instant feedback” is something Scott particularly enjoys about WHOOP. “To be able to check the sleep planner and see I need to go to bed ‘here’ and wake up ‘here’ if I want to peak” is what he finds most valuable. Scott even credits WHOOP for helping him secure his latest victory:
“It was funny, that weekend I was green Thursday and green Friday, but in the red Saturday night for Sunday. I did not sleep well. Because of that I didn’t go as hard as I usually do in my pre-round workout routine. I really focussed on conserving energy before I teed off.”
Clearly the strategy paid off. Scott hopes to play on the Champions Tour for 10 years–don’t bet against him.

WHOOP had the opportunity to speak with Scott about his unlikely path to becoming a pro golfer, and how he’s been able to stay on top of the competition during his “second career.”
Barry McCarron, Scott’s father, was a Triple-A ballplayer who began playing a lot of golf after his baseball career came to a close. “He started dragging me out to the golf course as soon as I could walk,” Scott told WHOOP. “I think my only toy as a kid was a golf club that I would crawl around with,” he joked. In high school, Scott played a variety of sports, including football, basketball, baseball and tennis. But golf was always his first love, and it earned him a scholarship to UCLA.
However, after graduating Scott gave up the game altogether. “I wasn’t playing that well, I just decided it wasn’t for me,” he said. “I was not a very good putter–not good enough for me to make it to the next level.” He pondered law school, but instead decided to team up with his dad.
The elder McCarron had owned a clothing business that was destroyed by the 1986 Napa River flood. When Scott finished school two years later, the pair started a golf apparel company in Sacramento. From there they began manufacturing headwear, and Scott’s career might’ve continued in that direction had he not attended a local Senior PGA Tour event in Rancho Murieta in 1991.
Amongst the likes of Arnold Palmer, Lee Trevino and Chi Chi Rodriguez, Scott saw several players using a new style of club–the long putter. It was a revelation:
“I went home that night, made my own, then tried it the next morning and was like ‘Hey, I can do this!’ I liked putting that way. When I found the long putter it made me think I could do this again.”
From there, Scott started competing in (and winning) amature events around his home state of California. A short while later, he turned pro.",3/15/17

After 8 weeks of dedicated training, Project PR culminated in a final 5k time trial. Overall, the results were astounding. From an anecdotal point of view, our community of runners (both beginners and experienced) expressed major excitement and satisfaction upon completing their program. Training for a 5k in the midst of a pandemic when gyms are closed, running in groups is discouraged, and winter weather is fast approaching, is not an easy feat.
Just ask Jennifer Baskerville-Burrows, a 54-year-old bishop from Indiana who put running aside after dealing with some sidelining injuries years prior. When she signed up for Project PR, she didn’t know what to expect, she just knew she wanted to get back to an activity she loved.
“For the first time in a long time, I got a consistent seven to eight hours of sleep each night because I was focused on making that a priority,” she said. Jennifer followed the Beginner Dynamic training program, which required her to use her WHOOP recovery and modify workouts accordingly. After 8 weeks, she completed the training injury-free and managed to knock a full minute off her 5k time. “Learning how to train and pay attention to my recovery made all the difference.”
Jennifer’s results were not uncommon. Here are some of the positive highlights from participants:
2,772: The number of runners who completed their 5k training
Improved their 5k time by an average of 2 minutes and 40 seconds
84% reported a daily sense of accomplishment
56% reported increased sense of motivation as the program progressed
This speaks to the power of what can happen when you commit to a plan. We received hundreds of messages from participants who could not believe the transformation that happened over these 8 weeks. Many shared how they felt more motivated, regained their love of running, were able to finally lose some weight, or simply enjoyed the virtual community aspect.",2/2/21
project-pr-runner-study,Here’s Why Every Runner Should Use WHOOP,"Setting Up The Project PR Experiment
To kick off Project PR, we partnered with Outside Magazine to help recruit participants and spread the word. We then reached out to Mary Cain and Nick Willis of Tracksmith Running to develop an 8-week 5k training program for beginners and experienced runners. For those unfamiliar with Mary and Nick’s accomplishments, they are both professional runners with numerous accolades, including world records, Olympic medals, and multiple championship titles between the two.
When recruiting participants, we needed both WHOOP members and non-WHOOP members for the control group who had never used our product before. We then broke up training groups based on the following criteria:
Experience Level: Beginner, Advanced, Expert
Experience Level: Beginner, Advanced, Expert
Training Protocol: WHOOP Dynamic, WHOOP Static, Control (Non-WHOOP members)
Training Protocol: WHOOP Dynamic, WHOOP Static, Control (Non-WHOOP members)
Experience level determined the weekly mileage and intensity participants would follow, while training protocol determined whether or not they’d be adjusting workouts based on WHOOP recovery.
Every week participants had a mix of running workouts, including intervals, hill sprints and recovery runs. For participants following the static plan, runners had a singular workout plan each day. Participants following the dynamic plan had to modulate their workouts each day based on their red, yellow, or green recovery and were given all 3 options to choose from based on their status that morning. Here’s an example:
Prior to starting their 8-week plan, participants were asked to complete a time trial or share a recent 5k time to establish their baseline performance. During the next eight weeks, participants were required to log all runs on Strava to verify compliance, and those who were WHOOP members had to log daily recovery, strain, and sleep data.",2/2/21

But what about the differences in those who trained based on their WHOOP recovery, versus those who didn’t? The results were astounding.
On average, participants who modulated workouts based on recovery (WHOOP Dynamic Groups) were up to 32.4% less likely to experience injury than those who followed a static plan. These injuries were self-reported and ranged from common injuries such as shin splints and achilles tendonitis to more sidelining injuries, like a pulled muscle or stress reaction.
In addition, the WHOOP Dynamic Groups reduced time spent training by up to 80 minutes each week depending on their recovery that morning. For context, a long run day for an experienced runner with a green recovery would run 60 minutes, while a runner with a red recovery would run 45 minutes.
While shaving off 15 minutes of mileage here and there may not seem like a lot, over time it certainly adds up and results in less impact on the body. Although both the static and dynamic groups experienced nearly identical physical gains, the dynamic group on average did less work, proving that it’s not always about more volume; it’s about smarter training.",2/2/21

project-pr-runner-study,Here’s Why Every Runner Should Use WHOOP,"Key Takeaways: WHOOP Offers Very Specific Guidance for Runners Looking to Improve
A common question runners ask when considering WHOOP is why they need another wearable in addition to their GPS watch. The answer is simple–WHOOP is not a GPS watch; it does something entirely different and provides data that can help you navigate the extremely difficult sport of running through smarter training.
Project PR uncovered critical insights that support the need for personalized training programs. It’s easy to download a standard running program online, but every human body is different and responds to training differently. Using WHOOP to customize your training needs can have profound impact for runners looking to reduce risk of injury and avoid overtraining.
In addition, WHOOP helps alleviate the common concern amongst runners who wonder How do I know if I’m even getting fitter? Key physiological indicators such as changes in resting heart rate and adaptation to training loads via heart rate can answer this question. In the chart below, you can see that over the course of 8 weeks, participants’ average strain decreased even though their workload increased by about 10% each week. This indicated to our team that participants were adapting to the training and improving fitness by being able to handle more mileage and intensity.
In the words of Joe Vigil, running coach to American record holder Deena Kastor, “There is no such thing as overtraining, just underresting.” This quote rings true for any runner who’s ever thought that getting in 2 more miles was more important than 30 minutes of extra sleep.
When using WHOOP alongside your running program, our study showed that participants were more likely to prioritize hours of sleep and recovery protocol, and they improved 5k performance by doing less work compared to the control counterparts.",2/2/21
project-pr-runner-study,Here’s Why Every Runner Should Use WHOOP,"Last October, WHOOP conducted a study to determine the effectiveness of training for runners based on recovery. Runners are notorious for pushing themselves too hard, risking injury and overtraining. In efforts to better understand how WHOOP could be an effective tool, we put the data to the test.
Ask any competitive runner why they stopped running, or why they gave up on the sport after graduating college. Nine out of ten times, it’s because of injury and the reality that running is an incredibly tough sport on the body. Without the physical therapists, coaches, and strength training that a collegiate program provides, many runners give up on their younger glory days and switch to a non-impact sport like cycling or swimming.
Even for beginner runners picking up the sport later in life, starting a running program can be just as challenging as you navigate the odd aches and pains that come with repeated pounding on the joints.
What if there was a smarter way to train that reduced risk of injury and kept runners healthier, longer? To answer this question, we launched Project PR: The Personalized Recovery Study. Our goal? Study the effects of personalized training based on WHOOP recovery.",2/2/21
proof-that-your-workout-really-is-working,Proof that Your Workout Really is Working,"Maybe I don’t have it in me to develop a “beach body.” Is it possible I’m just a “nonresponder”? Or, is that simply an excuse for not being committed to working hard enough?
A piece written earlier this year by Gretchen Reynolds of the New York Times explains the “nonresponder” concept in further detail:
“Is your workout getting you nowhere? Research and lived experience indicate that many people who begin a new exercise program see little if any improvement in their health and fitness even after weeks of studiously sticking with their new routine. Among fitness scientists, these people are known as ‘nonresponders.’ Their bodies simply don’t respond to the exercise they are doing. And once discouraged, they often return to being nonexercisers.”
However, the article goes on to cite a recent study that suggests the “nonresponder” theory isn’t actually true. Researchers put a group of subjects through two very different three-week-long workout regimens (one consisting of endurance cycling and the other high-intensity interval training), with time in between to return to their original fitness baselines. The subjects’ VO2 max, submaximal heart rate and lactate threshhold were measured before and after each three-week period. Results showed that all participants benefited from at least method or the other, if not both.
Runner’s World Magazine also recently published a story entitled The Myth of Exercise “Non-Responders”, which cites a second study that came to a similar conclusion. Five different subject groups performed identical 60-minute workout routines, with each group doing the workout either one, two, three, four or five times per week. There were some “nonresponders” among those who only exercised 1-3 times per week, but everyone who trained 4-5 times a week showed signs of improved fitness.",5/8/17
proof-that-your-workout-really-is-working,Proof that Your Workout Really is Working,"While these studies may indicate that with enough time and effort everyone can eventually find a workout routine that brings results, many of us are never able to get to the point where we see noticeable changes in our appearance.
WHOOP has helped me realize the impact exercise has on my body in ways that aren’t obvious when I look in the mirror.
If you’re active, WHOOP knows it. No matter what you do on any given day, whether it’s a jog, a spin class, a weightlifting session, a pickup basketball game, or even a round of golf (average WHOOP Strain: 8.9), WHOOP quantifies the Strain it puts on your body. Even if you struggle with consistency and have trouble seeing the benefits of your workouts, the WHOOP Strain metric can assure you that they are having a real impact.
WHOOP recognizes when I need more sleep, and when I am less recovered than normal. It knows when my resting heart rate is high, and when my heart rate variability is low. Understanding these things enables elite competitors to maximize their performance, but it also helps the rest of us see value in our own athletic endeavors.",5/8/17
proof-that-your-workout-really-is-working,Proof that Your Workout Really is Working,"WHOOP helps some of the best athletes in the world optimize their training and make the most of their elite talent–but not everyone is elite. A question I get time and time again when I’m among family and friends, “What can WHOOP do for me?”
I’ve seen both sides of the coin. Despite my continued love of sports, I am no longer a hardcore athlete. I was a serious tennis player in my youth and a coach in my early adulthood, but shortly after I graduated from college my involvement in high-level athletics shifted more towards the role of spectator. And as much as I still enjoy playing tennis, basketball, softball, volleyball and any number of other sports, the older I get the more difficult it becomes to find both the time and the opportunities to participate.
I also consider myself a casual runner–jogging is easy to do and it doesn’t require anyone else to take part. If the weather is nice, I enjoy it immensely. Time on my own to clear my head and the chance to get outside on a sunny day are often as much my inspiration as staying physically fit. For those reasons, I’ve never been a fan of going to the gym (also, I can’t stand running on a treadmill). When winter hits, I tend to pack it in until spring time.
I’ve trained for races on occasion, ranging from 5Ks to half marathons, usually when those close to me convince me to sign up. In those instances, I’ve had an obvious goal–completing the allotted distance in a certain time.
Outside of that, with my days as a competitive athlete long behind me, I find it very hard staying motivated to work out regularly. My main issue is that I rarely manage to see obvious results. There have been times when I’ve decided to start doing daily sets of pushups or crunches, but I’ve never managed to stick with them long enough to notice any change to my physique (or lack thereof).",5/8/17
proper-hydration-tips-improve-recovery,Benefits of Hydration and Tips to Stay Hydrated,"It’s no secret that keeping the body hydrated is an essential aspect of human performance. And while drinking water is a very easy thing to do, many of us still fail to adequately hydrate on a daily basis.
## Why is Hydration Important?
Roughly 60% of your body is made up of water. How hydrated you are affects the volume of your blood, and the less liquid you have in your system the harder it is for blood to circulate and deliver nutrients and oxygen to your body.
Additionally, your body uses water for thermoregulation (maintaining its temperature), keeping organs working correctly, lubricating joints, removing waste and preventing infections. Studies show that dehydration also negatively impacts mood and cognitive functioning.
“The fundamental basis of hydration is it helps circulate oxygen to your working muscles.” – Podcast No. 21: The Importance of Hydration & Recovery
## Benefits of Hydration
There are a great deal of benefits of drinking water. Among other things, it helps to:
Increase energy levels
Improve physical performance
Make your skin smoother, softer and healthier
Boost immunity
Aid the digestion process
Prevent and alleviate headaches
Promote weight loss
Relieve constipation
Avoid kidney damage and kidney stones
But most importantly, from a WHOOP perspective…
## Hydration Improves HRV, Resting Heart Rate & Recovery
The WHOOP Journal feature enables you to track various behaviors and observe their effect on sleep and recovery. The data is also analyzed in personalized Monthly Performance Assessments that break down exactly what impact these behaviors may have.
Roughly one-third of all WHOOP members monitor their hydration regularly with the journal. Those who do report hydrating sufficiently about two-thirds of the time. When they do, their average heart rate variability increases by 4.5 milliseconds, and their average resting heart rate decreases by 1.7 beats per minute.
Proper hydration is good for WHOOP members’ HRV and resting heart rates.",7/14/22
proper-hydration-tips-improve-recovery,Benefits of Hydration and Tips to Stay Hydrated,"Tips to Stay Hydrated
The following hydration tips can help make it easier for you to reach your daily goal of water consumption:
### WAKE-UP WATER
Have a glass of water as the first thing you do when you get up each day. Make it part of your morning routine.
### SET A REMINDER
Maybe it’s an app to track your fluid intake, or just an alarm on your phone that goes off once an hour (if you’re up and about for around 16 hours a day, that could be 16 glasses). Either way a regular reminder to drink water will go a long way towards keeping you hydrated.
### ALWAYS BRING A WATER BOTTLE
Beyond when you’re exercising or working out, whether it’s a walk around the neighborhood, a drive to the store, or even just sitting at your desk, if you have a water bottle with you at all times you’re naturally going to drink more of it.
### INCORPORATE WATER INTO YOUR BREAKS
Whenever you stop what you’re doing to stretch your legs, use the bathroom, clear your head, or rest from physical activity, drink some water too.
### CHOOSE WATER FIRST
Whether it’s coffee at breakfast, other beverages at lunch and dinner, or maybe something recreational to drink with friends or at any social gathering, have some water before anything else you drink.
### DRINK WATER WHEN YOU’RE HUNGRY
Oftentimes we feel as though we are hungry when in fact we are actually dehydrated. Rather than having a snack right away, drink water first before you eat.
### ADD FLAVOR
Many people don’t drink as much water as they should for no other reason than they aren’t excited by the taste (or lack thereof). A slice of fruit, splash of juice, flavor tablets, or even frozen berries instead of ice cubes may do the trick.
### HYDRATE WITH FOOD
Lots of fruits (like melons, peaches, strawberries, oranges and grapefruits) and vegetables (examples include cucumber, zucchini, lettuce, cauliflower and bell peppers) have a very high water content, as do cottage cheese and oatmeal as well.",7/14/22
proper-hydration-tips-improve-recovery,Benefits of Hydration and Tips to Stay Hydrated,"WATER WHEN AIR IS DRY
In places where humidity levels are very low, the dry air dehydrates you. This includes airplanes, high altitude in general, and anywhere with air conditioning running regularly. If you feel that AC blasting, have a glass of water.
And lastly, it’s worth adding that alcohol is a major contributor to dehydration. It’s no coincidence that alcohol consumption is the behavior most associated with a decrease in WHOOP recovery (-8% on average).",7/14/22
proper-hydration-tips-improve-recovery,Benefits of Hydration and Tips to Stay Hydrated,"How Much Water Should You Drink to Hydrate Properly?
Recommendations for how much water to drink per day vary, usually ranging from 0.5 ounces to 1 ounce for every pound that you weigh. So for a person who weighs 160 pounds, that’s about 10-20 glasses of water (8 oz glass) to prevent dehydration.
For athletes or anyone who sweats regularly, suggested fluid intake is generally on the higher side of that scale. To ensure that you are always properly hydrated, aiming to consume 1 ounce of water per pound that you weigh is a great daily goal.
We found that when our members log drinking 12 glasses of water, their next-day recovery improves 3% on average.
When WHOOP members report drinking 12 glasses of water they see notable benefits in their recovery the next day.
## How Do You Know if You are DEHydrated?
There is a very simple way to tell if your body is fully hydrated–just check your urine. It should be clear and odorless. If there is any color to it at all, it is a sign that you are at least somewhat dehydrated and should make an effort to drink more water.",7/14/22
psychedelics-veterans-ptsd-impact-whoop-data,Mind Manifested: How Psychedelics for Veterans with Depression and PTSD Impact WHOOP Data,"The journey to unlock performance and support human thriving involves partnerships and research where we have the opportunity to explore how behaviors influence physiology and overall health. One of the primary objectives of our partnership with the SEAL Future Foundation (SFF), is to promote the wellness of the active duty and veteran SEAL community through various initiatives. This includes case studies and research that help us better understand the value of various treatment modalities within this unique population.
## PTSD in Veteran SEALs
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a chronic illness, well-documented within the veteran population and is emerging as one of the most pressing public health issues due the COVID-19 pandemic and rising visibility of systemic oppression. The research emerging from Imperial College of London, MAPS, John Hopkins, Yale and others suggest that MDMA and psychedelic-assisted psychotherapies might be the breakthrough the world needs right now.
In our work with SFF over years, it has become clear that there is a tremendous need to investigate new and novel medications to treat post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as the co-occurring mental illness, depression. PTSD is a leading cause of distress and disability among veterans and there are limited pharmacologic interventions.
While two medications are currently FDA approved for PTSD, both antidepressants, the efficacy of these medications is quite limited. Some people do very well with them, but many others show little to no improvement in their symptoms. Further, these medications take weeks to months to reach their full benefit, and often even when some symptoms improve, others do not.",6/15/20
psychedelics-veterans-ptsd-impact-whoop-data,Mind Manifested: How Psychedelics for Veterans with Depression and PTSD Impact WHOOP Data,"What WHOOP Data Shows
We learned that many of the veteran SEALs on the platform were going through these treatments. We had the opportunity to dig into the data of a few veterans, two highlighted here, who underwent psychedelic experiences (ayahuasca and psilocybin). In conversations with these individuals it is clear that there is a belief that the insight they gleaned is not a subjective opinion or idea, but rather a discovered truth. It is actual knowledge.
The data outlined below suggests that the new knowledge garnered from this temporary experience had remarkable authority over the mind that influenced their physiological underpinnings. The fact that this one event can cause a reset of the mind, that a single experience could have that effect and manifest so profoundly in one’s physiology, is astounding and supports much of the research that is coming out recently.
### SUBJECT 1
Below are changes in WHOOP data averages for the month following post-psychedelic intervention compared to a 1-month pre-intervention baseline. Among other things, you’ll see an increase in heart rate variability (HRV) and percentage of time spent in rem sleep, as well as a decrease in resting heart rate.",6/15/20
psychedelics-veterans-ptsd-impact-whoop-data,Mind Manifested: How Psychedelics for Veterans with Depression and PTSD Impact WHOOP Data,"Psychedelics as an Alternative Treatment for PTSD
In an effort to find solutions for the portion of the SFF veteran community who were not responding to traditional therapeutic interventions, SFF and WHOOP began exploring alternative methods to treat various mental illnesses. We quickly learned about promising psychedelic research at Imperial College of London, led by the brilliant Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris, as well as other on-going work at the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), John Hopkins University, New York University and Yale, among others.
According to Dr. William Richards, Psychologist and Research Affiliate at John Hopkins Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research, psychedelics, despite a few caveats, are “remarkably safe” for most people. They’re not toxic or addictive, and they can be profoundly helpful. Richards continues to say that “psychedelics show ‘immense’ promise when it comes to treating mental health disorders.”
## What Are Psychedelics Actually?
“Psychedelics”, in literal terms, mean “psyche” which is “mind,” and “delic,” or “delos” means “manifested.” So, in reality it simply means “mind manifested.”
From the research to date, it seems the psychedelic experience is about muting the ego and bringing the mind into an observable space. In the typical adult brain, the ability to observe our thoughts in the present moment without ownership, judgement, and reaction is largely limited and dictated by how we have coped with and internalized past experiences. For many of us, our past experiences include profoundly traumatic events that are either specific in nature or that have persisted over decades.",6/15/20
psychedelics-veterans-ptsd-impact-whoop-data,Mind Manifested: How Psychedelics for Veterans with Depression and PTSD Impact WHOOP Data,"How They Can Benefit
It is very often the ego that enforces destructive narratives. It seems that psychedelics offer an opportunity to shut the ego down for a period of time, giving the space to recognize that there is an alternative ground on which to stand, that you are in fact not identical to your ego.
When the ego is no longer the most important thing, what does that look like? The ego is defensive by nature so when you take down those walls in the psyche you merge with something else. There is less of a distinction between you and the other, whether that “other” is other people in your life, the natural world, or even the universe. As these doors of the world begin to open, deep “connection” and “flow” become possible. And while it sounds trite, what seems to flow through those connections is love–incredible feelings of love and reconnection.",6/15/20
psychedelics-veterans-ptsd-impact-whoop-data,Mind Manifested: How Psychedelics for Veterans with Depression and PTSD Impact WHOOP Data,"SUBJECT 2
Over the same time frame, Subject 2 showed an improvement in HRV, better WHOOP recoveries, and more sleep.
In our veteran SEAL population, we see high levels of chronic sympathetic activation (resulting in suppressed HRV) consistent with symptoms of PTSD. This over-activation results in low heart rate variability. The sustained increase observed in this data of more than 10ms over the course of a month post treatment is clinically significant. Additionally, the positive changes in sleep architecture and sleep consistency are also incredibly encouraging. It appears that the shift in perspective and mindset creates a shift in behavior, which in turn produces profound improvements in physiologic markers.
The anecdotal insights around quality of life, satisfaction and clarity are profound as well. They are dramatic improvements that correlate with the data. Subject 2 (who did 5 deployments in a 7-year span) described his thoughts, actions and emotions as being perfectly harmonized without any friction or tension.
While these are just two case studies, we are excited to be a part of future research with Imperial College of London to better understand how various guided psychedelic therapeutic interventions can be used to help treat PTSD as well as other mental health disorders.",6/15/20
purpose-efficacy-control-tracking-mental-health,"Purpose, Efficacy, Control: Track Mental Health in WHOOP Journal","WHOOP recently updated the app’s Journal Feature to give our members the opportunity to track their mental health on a daily basis by monitoring three core psychological needs: Purpose, efficacy and control. What do these mean exactly? In short:
Purpose: Do your environment, work and relationships provide you with an outlet to live your values?
Efficacy: Do you believe that you have the skills and resources to produce a desired or intended result?
Control: Do you feel as though you have autonomy and choice over your day/schedule/life?
Every day, the journal gives you a chance to log a response to each of these as “yes, strong,” “yes, somewhat,” or “no.”",5/30/20
purpose-efficacy-control-tracking-mental-health,"Purpose, Efficacy, Control: Track Mental Health in WHOOP Journal","Purpose
Be aware and honest about what is most important to you. Rather than trying to “discover” who you are, “decide” who you are. Knowing what matters to you and who matters to you brings clarity to your decision making and allows you to focus your time, energy and attention in a way that is in line with your core values.
Here’s an exercise to help you construct an honest reflection of your interior life, then remind you how to stay true to your path. Expose yourself to 5-6 “best-self” words (for example, honest, peaceful, present, tolerant, patient, grateful) as often as possible (put them in your phone where you will see them or in a notebook, bookmark, etc). Think about what type of actions will help you get closer to being the person you want to be and enlist the support of people you trust to help keep you accountable.
So, when answering the WHOOP Journal question: Feel a sense of purpose?
### A CHOICE OF “YES, STRONG” MAY INDICATE YOU:
Feel a clear life purpose that aligns with behaviors, values and goals
Take initiative to plan and prioritize tasks with clear motivation and intent
Adopt behaviors that enable the “energy” and “time” to live values
### “YES, SOMEWHAT” SUGGESTS YOU:
Understand purpose and attempt to align values and behaviors
Often need approval and direction to stay on the path
### “NO” MAY IMPLY YOU:
Are unsure of purpose and how to prioritize tasks
Often get pulled away from process and become focused on outcomes
Seek validation and attention from hollow sources",5/30/20
purpose-efficacy-control-tracking-mental-health,"Purpose, Efficacy, Control: Track Mental Health in WHOOP Journal","Control
“Happiness” is internal. When we feel “in control” over our aspirations, dreams and goals our self-image improves and stabilizes.There are a lot of ways to define “happiness.” One is to think of it as a state where your mind is not wandering off looking for voids to fill. The idea is to develop habits and a way of thinking that position you to focus on your internal state more than external circumstances.
Be mindful that habits accumulate and we get more and more attached to them over time. It is important to recognize when a habit is not working for you and be able to uncondition yourself. Habits, especially the ones that don’t upgrade our lives, tend to be tough to break. Ask for help!
Feel in control of your life?
### SELECTING “YES, STRONG” MAY INDICATE YOU:
Are able to spend time and energy on things that bring you joy and inspiration
Understand your priorities and as a result have a platform to make decisions that align with your values and goals
### “YES, SOMEWHAT” SUGGESTS YOU:
Spend some time and energy on what brings you joy or inspiration
Understand priorities but often allow yourself to get pulled into the agenda of others
### “NO” MAY IMPLY YOU:
Feel very little control over your life in general
Have levels of joy and energy that are very inconsistent
Are unsure how your habits contribute to your well-being
Incorporating a daily reflection on how you’re feeling related to purpose, efficacy and control can help prompt the behaviors that support and foster these core psychological “needs.” In turn, it will likely improve your overall well being and allow you to perform better in everything you do.",5/30/20
purpose-efficacy-control-tracking-mental-health,"Purpose, Efficacy, Control: Track Mental Health in WHOOP Journal","Efficacy
Your brain has “default settings,” optimize them! One’s “self efficacy” is the biggest predictor of success in a specific task. The path to efficacy is about creating a flexible mindset that builds better models as it gathers more data about reality.
Beliefs inform how you experience the world. They tell you how important you are, what you are capable of, your role in society, etc. If beliefs about your current state or your thoughts about the future are limited or faulty, your human potential will be diminished. There is ample research that shows practicing gratitude, choosing an optimist view point, and adopting a mindset that growth/future learning is possible greatly predict success and overall potential for happiness.

The topics of conversation included the exciting start to his major league career, his struggles with injuries last season, and how WHOOP is helping him come back strong in 2017.
When did it first cross your mind that you might become a Major League Baseball player?
“I played baseball and basketball all throughout high school, those were my two main sports. I always wanted to be [a pro baseball player]. But I was small, I was tiny in high school, and from a town of only 5,000 people (Clarks Summit, PA). It was always in the back of my mind, but I didn’t know how realistic it was until I got to college.”
Do you remember your first day in the big leagues?
“Oh yeah, absolutely. I’d just gotten a September call up and my family all made it there. It was a day game against Arizona. I had the game-winning 2-RBI hit. It was pretty special.”
What’s been the most memorable moment of your career so far?
“My best memory is actually the next day–I came in during the 9th inning, pinch hit, and [on the first pitch] hit a walk-off homer on my second day in the big leagues. Just having my family out there for that, it was really special to share with them.”
How do you like living in San Diego?
“The whole city is great. I live right downtown and I walk to the park every day. It clears your mind before and after the game, and the weather is just perfect.”
What sort of activities do you do on your days off?
“During the season we play 162 games in 180 days. On those off days you pretty much just hang out and not do much of anything.”

When did you first find out about WHOOP?
“My brother recently started a baseball recruiting company. He got a WHOOP to try out back in December and was raving about it. He said I should try it too, so I got one after Christmas. I haven’t taken it off since. It’s done really well for me.”
How does it best help you?
“Spring training is just a grind playing every day–I wake up at 6 and we’re at the field till 430. [WHOOP] helps me with the strain on my body and knowing when I can do extra stuff and when I should hold back a little bit.”
What do you like best WHOOP?
“The two things I like best are definitely the sleep detection and the daily strain. There are some days that I was supposed to lift and I decided not to do it that day because my recovery wasn’t so high. Coming off the injury, I want to be positive that I’m ready to do each exercise and that my body is ready to take on that strain. When you’re playing every single day, some days it’s easy to get caught up in it and think you feel alright, but the strain tells you how your body is really feeling. That’s the cool thing about it.”
Has your sleep improved?
“Even if I’m not that tired, I’ll get that reminder [from the sleep planner, which helps differentiate between time in bed and time asleep] and be like ‘oh shoot, I need to go to bed.’ I’ve been getting to bed around 8:30 every day just so that I can get the amount of rest that I need.”

For more than 3 hours, Emma was essentially operating at a near maximum aerobic capacity, but she was averaging 8:16 per mile. Based on her long runs, 8-minute pace should have been a breeze, and her heart rate should have been 130-140 bpm.
“I could feel myself getting woozy, and my legs were tight from dehydration. The medical staff had me sit down, take my hat off, and drink broth,” said Emma. “I felt like I was not sweating enough–I was so so thirsty and all I wanted was something cool and salty.” You can see where Emma took a break about halfway through the race when her heart rate dips down as she rests.
Despite slowing her pace down, her body was still losing electrolytes quickly under the sun. When your body sweats, it must increase blood flow to the skin’s surface to release heat. As a result, less blood is available to your muscles and heart, which is why you have to work harder when you exercise. When you aren’t sweating enough to compensate for your effort due to dehydration, that’s when exercise can become dangerous as your body overheats.
For an experienced marathoner like Emma, she knew Boston 2017 wasn’t going to be a fast race, and she knew she’d have to dial it back. Her focus was simply getting to the finish line.
“Throughout the course I stopped at several medical tents. I didn’t want to pass out or get cramps and not be able to finish. I would essentially pop my head in the med tent doors, ask if they had any broth, and quickly drink some before moving on,” she says. “I would feel my legs loosen up and my spirit rejuvenated after a combination of broth, GU packets, and Gatorade.”",4/20/17

Many of these runners were anxious about the forecasted temperature with estimates climbing higher and higher as race day approached. After a long winter of freezing temps and a cold start to spring, it looked like Marathon Monday was going to be a pocket of warm weather.
While the heat wasn’t as bad as the 87° day back in 2012 (when nearly 5,000 runners chose to defer), the temperatures this year still hovered in the 70s with a glaring sun on a minimally shaded course. At the end of the race, local news station WCVB reported that 2,597 runners sought medical treatment during or after the race, with at least 52 people taken to hospitals by ambulance. Reports also mention some runners had fevers up to a dangerous 108° when they crossed the finish line.
To the marathon spectators, 70-degree weather is just another nice day. But for marathoners heavily exerting themselves for hours at a time, it’s incredibly important to pay attention to the body while properly hydrating and fueling throughout the event, especially when race conditions are different than the conditions you trained through.
For runner and WHOOP Product Associate Emma Van Emmerik, the heat certainly took a toll on her performance.

The morning of the Boston Marathon, Emma was prepared to take on the conditions. She had been taking a lot of salt and electrolyte supplements, and her physical fitness was peaking. However, due to the heat, it was clear that she wouldn’t be hitting a personal best.
“I had so many important people out there along those 26.2 miles that I did not want to miss seeing. When I heard that it was going to be hot, I decided to focus on enjoying the experience, rather than aiming for a time,” said Emma.
Before we review Emma’s Boston Marathon data, here’s a look at one of her typical long runs:
This WHOOP activity chart highlights a 17-mile run averaging a 7:30/mi pace completed on Saturday, March 4th when it was 21° in Boston. Emma’s average heart rate is 156 throughout the duration of the run, which is a moderate aerobic effort–not recovery pace, but not marathon race pace either. She slows down around about 3/4 of the way in and pauses to stretch, and her heart rate drops about 30-40 beats. Then she picks it back up to finish the run.
For marathoners, a typical long run is somewhere between 15 and 20 miles depending on how training is going. Although long runs should not simulate racing a marathon, they are still good indicators of fitness and one’s ability to sustain 26.2 miles, both physically and mentally. Emma said most of her long runs were between 7:20 and 7:30 mile pace, and she generally felt comfortable and strong. This would translate to somewhere between a 3:10 and 3:20 finishing time for marathon day.
However, Emma’s data the day of the Boston Marathon tells a different story.",4/20/17
quarantine-exercise-trends,Exercise and Fitness Trends During Quarantine from COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed how we behave as a society in a number of ways. With many of us spending so much more time at home and away from others, what impact has this had on how we exercise and work out?
A recent study examined data from 50,000 WHOOP members between January 1 and May 15 of this year, including over 4.9 million workouts logged in our system. This allowed for a comparison of exercise and fitness behaviors over equal durations of time from before most of us were socially distancing and living in quarantine, and while it was happening. March 9 was used as the cutoff date, the week the World Health Organization classified COVID-19 as a pandemic and the US declared a national state of emergency.
## Most Popular Quarantine Exercises
The study looked at the six most popular forms of exercise people record with WHOOP: Running, functional fitness, weightlifting, cycling, swimming and walking. It tracked the relative frequency of each activity on a daily basis (the percent change in frequency day by day compared to the daily average for the entire time period).
As you can see in the graphic below, there was a significant uptick in running, cycling and walking activities logged once social distancing began.
QUARANTINE EXERCISE MODALITIES WITH BIGGEST INCREASE
Walking took the biggest jump, followed by running and cycling. The spikes on the graph show increased participation in all three activities on weekends, which for the most part continued to hold true during quarantine.
However, with running in particular, the frequency of weekday and weekend participation became a lot more similar. Potentially a lack of commuting, or simply not physically going to work, gave runners more opportunity to get outside and go for a jog during the week.",7/17/20
quarantine-exercise-trends,Exercise and Fitness Trends During Quarantine from COVID-19,"And the Quarantine Workouts that Decreased…
It’s no surprise that the three activities people started doing more of are all individual forms of exercise that happen outdoors–a needed break from being stuck inside for most of the day. Additionally functional fitness, which for many of our members was often a solo workout taking place at home to begin with, saw little change in frequency due to quarantine.
On the other hand, weightlifting and swimming saw significant decreases in participation once people started socially distancing, no doubt coinciding with the closures of gyms and athletic facilities.
## Other Trends in Quarantine Exercise: Increased Frequency and Intensity
Overall, the sample of 50,000 WHOOP members exercised 1.1% more often once quarantine began than they did previously. With many of our standard social activities no longer available, it makes sense that people would turn to working out to pass the time.
It’s also worth noting that exercise modalities like running and cycling which are compliant with social distancing are activities that require a high cardiovascular load. The study found that on average people spent 1.8% more time working out in their three highest heart rate zones in quarantine.
Beyond exercising more often and at a higher level of intensity while socially distancing, the study also discovered improvements in several key physiological markers that WHOOP tracks, including sleep, resting heart rate and heart rate variability.

Maybe the most intriguing WHOOP data Eric has come across is from when he logged an ice bath. “My ice bath heart rate was visually the coolest in my opinion. I did 3 rounds of 5 minutes in the cold, then 5 minutes in a hot bath. My HR spiked right away to 127 bpm when I first got in the ice, and then the trend line steadily declined as my body got acclimated to it.”
Getting into an ice bath caused Eric’s heart rate to spike immediately.
It wasn’t a lot, but simply sitting in a tub of ice led to Eric accumulating a 4.4 strain. On the other hand, for him gaming was 0.0 strain with his HR never exceeded 93 bpm (you can check out the video on “Gaming with Derek” with CrossFit Games host and WHOOP member Derek Forrest).
“So far I’ve been to 3 different states and have worked with over a dozen different experts and coaches,” Eric added. “One of my goals is to continue to travel and complete each activity as authentically as possible with amazing people!”",2/11/22

Eric was also in the process of training for a marathon, so naturally that was a great place for him to start. “Completing the marathon helped me build trust within myself, just focusing on today and doing the best I can to optimize my performance. With WHOOP I felt very in sync with my body, so I took a leap of faith and made a promise to myself to do all 84 activities.”
As of now, Eric has participated in 25 different WHOOP activities. To this point, his first (running) is still the most strenuous, a 20.7 activity strain (on a 0-21 scale) for the marathon he finished in 4 hours and 24 minutes. He achieved his highest heart rate to date during his most recent activity (jumping rope), maxing out at 186 beats per minute.

quest-to-complete-every-whoop-activity,From Australian Football to Yoga: A Quest to Complete Every WHOOP Activity,"Attempting Every WHOOP Activity
Eric says the idea to try every WHOOP activity came to him on August 13, 2021.
“I ran, played golf, did a CrossFit WOD, and then played tennis all in one day, hitting a 19.3 day strain,” He told us. “I really enjoyed the process of learning something new (tennis) and hanging out with some fun people.”
About a year after graduating from college, Eric joined a CrossFit gym owned by his sister and brother-in-law, Silk City Fit in Manchester, CT. He’d spent most of his life playing baseball and was feeling a need to get back to some sort of physical activity.
“After getting into CrossFit a few friends and I started to play adult rec league sports as well. I noticed I got pretty good at kicking a kickball, dodging a dodgeball, and doing whatever physical activity. My experience with CrossFit gave me the ability to take any opportunity and feel confident about doing it.”
Commuting was a much more enjoyable WHOOP activity than Eric expected it to be.
Now 26, Eric joined WHOOP in the summer of 2019. “From there, fitness became a priority in my life,” he said. “As I kept doing new things, I would always check to see if WHOOP had them as activities I could log. Going through the list, a few caught my eye that I wanted to try, but I kind of sat on that idea until the day I played tennis.”
At the time, Eric was getting a master’s degree in behavior analysis. “We were being taught that ‘learning’ itself is a behavior, and it blew my mind,” he explained. “And the process of learning can be generalized across different environments and tasks–like how learning a second language is hard, but once you do it it becomes easier to learn a third, and so on. I felt that first hand after playing tennis, and decided trying every WHOOP activity would be a really great adventure for me.”",2/11/22

real-life-fatigue-meter-from-video-game-hockey,Real-Life 'Fatigue Meter' from Video Game Hockey?,"The green points indicate his peak heart rate during each round of exercise, while the red points show his heart rate at the end each resting period–the difference between the two is his HRR. As you can see, his heart rate recovered less and less each time until he stopped. Had it returned closer to normal during his rests, he likely would’ve been capable of performing longer.
A recent case study by WHOOP data scientists Chris Allen and Emily Breslow examined the HRR of WHOOP users after running. Across the board, the runners’ heart rates recovered faster after workouts on days when their WHOOP Recoveries were higher. WHOOP Recovery is designed to show how prepared an athlete’s body is to take on Strain, so it comes as no surprise that there was a direct correlation between it and the runners’ HRR.
The study also indicated that the strength of the relationship between Recovery and HRR varied for each athlete. A key component of WHOOP is the understanding that no two human bodies are alike, and that different people may find success from different training loads and methods.
How can HRR knowledge be practically applied to ice hockey? The typical diagram of a hockey player’s in-game heart rate might appear similar to the athlete’s from the Burpee exercise above. However, the goal would be to ensure that only sufficiently rested skaters are put back on the ice.
Here’s a sample screenshot of one WHOOP user’s data while playing ice hockey:
If a coach referenced this data throughout the game, he could substitute lines based on the most recovered heart rates. Not only that, he’d also be able to avoid the scenario mentioned on page 31 of the NHL ‘94 instruction manual:
“Your fatigue bar may be decreased due to one player who’s ‘dogging it.’ Go to the ‘edit line’ screen to get rid of the player who is out of shape.”",1/17/17
real-life-fatigue-meter-from-video-game-hockey,Real-Life 'Fatigue Meter' from Video Game Hockey?,"During my junior and senior years of high school, there was one thing my buddies and I did almost exclusively whenever we got together: We played NHL ‘94 for Super Nintendo (not to knock the equally great Sega Genesis version, that’s just what we had). I’m sure there are plenty of guys my age out there who will tell you to this day that NHL ‘94 is the best video game of all time. I wouldn’t argue.
The game was so popular that clips of it made now famous appearances in Kevin Smith’s 1995 film Mallrats (“Breakfast? Breakfast, schmrekfest. Look at the score. I’m only in the middle of the second, and I’m winning 12 to 2. Breakfasts come and go, Rene. Now, Hartford—the whale—hey, they only beat Vancouver once… maybe twice in a lifetime”), and in the 1996 cult classic Swingers.
If you chose to play the more sophisticated version of the game with the automatic line changes turned off, it featured “fatigue meters” that indicated how tired your players were (see the photo above and page 30 of the instruction manual). Fatigued lines recovered when given time to rest on the bench.
With today’s technology, it’s possible to manage real-life hockey line changes in the same way that the video game did 20 years ago. One way to do it might be to apply a metric for assessing cardiovascular fitness known as heart rate recovery (HRR). Simply put, HRR represents the decrease in heart rate as it attempts to get back to baseline after strenuous activity.
The dataset below is helpful for understanding HRR. An athlete was instructed to do as many Burpees (a type of squat thrust) as he could in one minute. He was then given a minute to rest and asked to perform the task again. This continued for as long as he was able to keep going:",1/17/17

I bought a WHOOP to keep me accountable after retiring from professional sports. Working out is something that is second nature to me and a huge part of my life. I work out almost every day and it occurred to me that lately it had turned into a bit of a chore. I confused not wanting to work out with not being disciplined.
The more I exercised and failed to give myself time to recover, the worse my workouts became. I was constantly in the red and yellow zones. When I opened my WHOOP app in the morning and my recovery was green, my first reaction was, “Well that sucks, I’m in the green and now this means I have to work out.” How backwards is that!
On the other hand, when I saw myself in the red and the yellow I would think “Yes! I have an excuse if I have a bad workout.” That thought process alone should be an obvious red flag and a clear sign to give my mind and body some rest (which is exceedingly difficult for me). My WHOOP has really helped me recognize that I was burning out.

Lately I’ve started only working out when I actually feel like it. It has not only benefited my performance, but also made working out infinitely more enjoyable. I have also tried to be kinder to myself while practicing self-compassion and self-love (two very foreign concepts to me).
Strategies such as self-talk, reflecting, being present in the moment, and writing down my thoughts have all been extremely helpful and had a positive effect on many different aspects of my life. You can see it in my WHOOP recovery, including a pair of recent 3-day green streaks! I’ve never had that before.

I have now retired as a professional athlete, am back in university studying Neuroscience, and have moved on to coaching. The space of mental health in sports is only growing and getting bigger, and I want to help my athletes understand that what they are doing is their choice–what they are learning is an open conversation between us.
Authoritative-type coaching is very last century (because we coach the way we were coached), and we are starting to see a shift away from this as athletes become more comfortable talking about how they feel. I’ve found the best way to really connect and get the most out of my athletes is by understanding and communicating with them, which builds intrinsic motivation.
There is also life after sports, something not talked about much with a lack of resources set up to help athletes transition through this period. Many athletes feel like they lose their identity when they stop competing, which can lead to high anxiety and depression. We need to help and start asking our athletes what they enjoy doing outside of sports.
I wanted to share my story because I know a lot of high-achieving athletes go through this, especially Asian-Americans/Australians who don’t believe in self-love and self-care because culturally it’s not discussed or demonstrated to us. My aim is to further the mental health conversation and dialogue in pro sports–it’s OK not to be OK. I want people to recognize that getting help is a sign of strength and not weakness.
Most importantly, there’s nothing wrong with being kind to yourself.

That’s roughly 12% of the time over the past eight months that my body has been adequately recovered. It sounds crazy when I write it down.
As a professional athlete and growing up in an Asian family, it was the norm to feel like I was always doing the most, being compared to others, and constantly valuing everything external. Not being kind to myself and continually pushing myself is what got me to the highest level of my sport, including two Olympic Games. Being externally motivated was also a strong driving force. I valued so much of what people thought of me and my achievements that I lost sight of why I was doing the things I was doing and questioned if I even liked doing it. I thought my achievements defined who I was as a person, and my worth was dependent on what I’ve accomplished and the external validation I receive.",7/9/21

Being hard on myself became the norm in order to avoid complacency. The line of thought went something like this: If I accept who I am, where I am, and what I have, then I will become unproductive and lazy. It all came down to the misconception that acceptance equals contentment, which also equals laziness.
This carried out into my normal life post retirement, and subconsciously caused a cycle of anxiety and tension. At some point, I came across the idea and practice of self-love and acceptance.

You look down at your heart rate monitor and discover your heart rate is way above your target heart rate.
There are many reasons your heart rate might be high during your easy runs but before we get into the potential causes, it’s important to know your resting and maximum heart rates, and your heart rate training zones, so that you can understand your personal baseline.",7/5/22
reasons-why-your-heart-rate-is-high-on-easy-runs,9 Reasons Why Your Heart Rate is High on Easy Runs,"9 Reasons Why Your Running HR is High
One of the simplest reasons your heart rate is high during easy runs is that your run isn’t actually that easy. You might be on the same jogging path you use every day, but today your heart rate is unusually high. Or, you might have taken a morning jog on a dirt road near your vacation cabin and note your heart rate was abnormally high when you thought you were taking it easy.
There are various natural explanations for a high heart rate during a run. There are also several physiological and health-related reasons. We’ll dig into several reasons below.
1. Weather
Weather is a major variable that can make your daily run harder than it is normally. On hazy, hot and humid days your resting heart rate can be 20% higher than average. On hot days your running heart rate would see a significant increase as your body tries to cool itself. When you sweat during hot weather your body sends more blood to the skin. The evaporating perspiration cools your skin and blood and your blood moves into the body to regulate your core temperature. High humidity makes it even more difficult for your body to cool itself as it doesn’t allow your sweat to evaporate.
2. Altitude
High altitude can dramatically increase the intensity of your runs. When arriving at a high-altitude area you’ll notice your heart rate and breathing are faster than at lower elevations. This is because oxygen levels are lower at altitude, meaning the heart and lungs must work harder to get enough oxygen to your organs and tissues. Running makes it even more difficult to get enough oxygen to your muscles. It can take weeks to fully acclimate to altitude and until then, you may not experience a normal running heart rate.
3. Terrain",7/5/22
reasons-why-your-heart-rate-is-high-on-easy-runs,9 Reasons Why Your Heart Rate is High on Easy Runs,"WHOOP Tracks your Heart Rate While Running
WHOOP Strain Target tracks your heart rate during activity. It can show your current heart rate at any time during use, and lets you see what heart rate zone you’re working out in. Using the data WHOOP provides you can see if your heart rate is too high or too low and make adjustments.
Additionally, the Strain Target gives you recommendations for your daily exertion based on your recovery and strain you’ve already accumulated. When you start an activity, it shows your strain building in real time towards the suggested goal. It enables you to better understand if you should continue to push yourself, or if you’re overdoing it, allowing you to make informed decisions in the moment. Using the data WHOOP provides you can see if your heart rate is too high or too low and make adjustments.
WHOOP Strain Target measures your heart rate during activity such as running.

reasons-why-your-heart-rate-is-high-on-easy-runs,9 Reasons Why Your Heart Rate is High on Easy Runs,"Running over trails or hills can affect your heart rate, even when you’re taking it easy over rough terrain. Your hip flexors, hamstrings and calves will have to do more work to stabilize you when running uphill or over rocky ground, and the additional output will raise your heart rate.
4. Cardiac drift
Cardiac drift refers to the natural increase in heart rate that occurs when running with little or no change in pace. It’s a common misconception that if you run at a consistent pace, your heart rate will remain consistent. However, research shows that it’s common to see heart rate edge upwards as much as 10-20 bpm over a 30 minute period during easy runs, even with no increase in perceived effort. You may not notice your heart rate rise as your breathing does not usually go up during this event.
This happens when your body temperature rises and you begin losing fluids. Your body starts to increase blood flow to the skin (similar to hot weather). As your body struggles to maintain core temperature your heart must work harder to maintain your energy output. Staying hydrated and keeping cool may help you control your heart rate.
5. Poor sleep and recovery
Not getting enough sleep can affect your daily recovery in a number of ways, including decreased alertness and reduced coordination. It can also raise your resting heart rate. A poor recovery means your body isn’t as ready to perform as it normally is. It can cause an increased heart rate and respiratory rate, and it can make a normally easy run feel tough.
Recovery is how well prepared your body is to perform. WHOOP calculates daily recovery on several physiological metrics: Heart rate variability (HRV), RHR, sleep performance, and respiratory rate. A bad night’s sleep, illness, yesterday’s strenuous workout, and consuming alcohol are some of the things that negatively affect recovery.
6. Overtraining and fatigue",7/5/22
reasons-why-your-heart-rate-is-high-on-easy-runs,9 Reasons Why Your Heart Rate is High on Easy Runs,"Establish Your Baseline
Your normal resting heart rate (RHR) is unique and changes as you age. Factors that can affect your RHR include your weight and health, stress, amount of sleep you get, certain medications, alcohol and tobacco use, and the weather. The best time to measure your resting heart rate is first thing in the morning, or by using a heart rate monitor like WHOOP. WHOOP calculates your RHR each night using a dynamic average weighted towards your deepest periods of sleep, allowing for consistent readings.
Maximum heart rate also changes as you age. Max heart rate is the greatest number of beats per minute (bpm) your heart can possibly reach during all-out strenuous exercise. To find yours, you can use a formula like the Tanaka (208 – 0.7 x age) or the Gulati (206 – 0.88 x age, for women only). Every human body is different with varying maximum heart rates, so a better solution is to use a wrist-worn heart rate monitor like WHOOP to determine your individual max heart rate.
By knowing your max HR you can establish your heart rate training zones. Heart rate zones are a percentage of your maximum heart rate. HR zone training is an efficient way to improve your cardiovascular fitness while challenging yourself. For example, during your easy run, your heart rate should be in the 60-70% of your max heart rate. This is a heart rate that’s sustainable for long periods of exercise, such as a long run.
Heart rate training lets you improves your cardiovascular fitness while challenging yourself.
Now that you’ve established a baseline, you can measure your heart rate during training and understand what a high running heart rate looks and feels like.",7/5/22
reasons-why-your-heart-rate-is-high-on-easy-runs,9 Reasons Why Your Heart Rate is High on Easy Runs,"Overtraining has a lot of symptoms: among them are fatigue that won’t go away, moodiness, muscle soreness, loss of motivation, missing your period, and an elevated heart rate while running.
Taking a long break from training, more than a couple rest, can help you recover thoroughly, but you may also want to see a doctor.

7. Stress
Running being an individual activity usually means you have time to think. For some, this time becomes a period to destress and deal with anxieties. For others, it becomes a time of anxiety.
Stress raises cortisol and adrenaline which, with these other negative factors lead to increased heart rate while running. More than 60% of WHOOP members experiencing stress see their resting heart rate rising 1 beat per minute. Stress also affects sleep, recovery and HRV.
If your mind starts to spin during a run and you notice a higher-than-normal heart rate, you may want to try running with friends, or listen to music or a podcast to distract yourself.
8. Dehydration
Your body uses water to keep itself operating at the correct temperature. This is called thermoregulation. It maintains your core temperature and ensures your organs work properly. In addition, water lubricates your joints, prevents infections, and removes waste.
Drinking enough water is important on a daily basis and more so when you’re active on hot or humid days. As mentioned above, perspiration is your body’s way of cooling itself, but if you’re parched your body doesn’t have enough water to produce sweat. Levels of electrolytes like sodium and potassium change when you’re dehydrated, which can interfere with your heart rate.
Dehydration can negatively affect your mood and your cognitive functions. It can also cause low blood pressure and raise your heart rate. Signs of dehydration include headache, fatigue, and rapid heart beat.

You may want to take a break to check on yourself. Drink water and take a break in the shade. If your heart rate doesn’t decrease during your rest, or if you experience any of these symptoms during a run you should seek medical attention.
## Tips to Lower Your Heart Rate While Running
The easiest way to lower your heart rate is to reduce your intensity. Try walking up the hills instead of running, or decide on a slower pace. Or you can take a break and rest in the shade for a few minutes. Deep breathing may help slow your heart rate. Breath deep through your nose until your belly expands and exhale through your nose and mouth. Repeat until your heart rate has slowed. You may also want to avoid stimulants or alcohol before a run. Avoid drinking coffee or alcohol before a run and make sure you are well-hydrated.",7/5/22
recap-whoop-athletes-in-rio-2016,Recap: WHOOP Athletes in Rio 2016,"During Gevvie’s A Final race, the waters were choppy – quite choppy, in fact. For most of the racers this level of chop was unfamiliar, but luckily for Gevvie, it felt like home. Hailing from Boston and training on the rough Charles River, this otherwise unpleasant course was a dream for Gevvie and her coach.
“I could feel everyone else struggling a little bit, and I was like, ‘Yes, this is Boston. This is what I want. This is rough water.’”
Gevvie used her 7th place finish in the London games as motivation to fuel her training. It was a gutsy performance. If you saw it, you know what I mean. If you didn’t, just imagine competing in an all-out sprint for 2,000 meters – or 1.24 miles – and then leaving it all on the line, knowing this was the final race of your career. Not only does that take strength and stamina, but it also requires mental and emotional toughness.
Leading up to her performance, Gevvie’s Recovery had an impressive uptick throughout her time in Rio. Three weeks before Gevvie’s August 13th silver medal race, she had an average Recovery of 68. Not bad for an athlete who is preparing for the Olympics. When comparing this average to Gevvie’s July average of 57, you can see that she prioritized Recovery as Rio approached. That means more sleep in conjunction with balanced Strain.
Then, 2 weeks before her final race, Gevvie’s average Recovery dropped to 57. It’s only reasonable to believe that traveling and preparation for Rio had an effect on this change. It’s not necessarily significant, but worth noting. Then, one week before her final race, her average Recovery climbed to 74 and continued to improve to an average of 87 as she was three days before her final race.
This upward trend and dedication to Sleep and Recovery helped Gevvie find peak performance in Rio – resulting in a silver medal.",8/25/16
recap-whoop-athletes-in-rio-2016,Recap: WHOOP Athletes in Rio 2016,"The Rio Olympics have come to a close. A memorable close, at that.
Four years ago, the London Olympic rings were lowered after a successful two weeks of competition, and now the same has happened in Rio. A full quadrennial of preparation took center stage with lightning fast swimming performances, mesmerizing moves on the mat, and second chances on the track that left the world sitting on the edge of their seats, wanting more.
In the middle of these successes, we’re honored to say that WHOOP played a significant role in helping 29 members from Team USA, Great Britain, Australia, Serbia, and the Netherlands achieve peak performance. In total, WHOOP athletes earned 7 gold medals, 4 silver medals, and 1 bronze medal. These medals spanned the pool, the track, and the waters of Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon. With every WHOOP athlete that won, our office in Boston was watching live from 4,845 miles away.
In honor of the conclusion of the games, we’re taking a look back at four WHOOP medal winners who all achieved peak performance during their competition. In this post, we’re highlighting USA singles sculls rower Gevvie Stone, USA basketball player Kyle Lowry, USA distance swimmer Connor Jaeger, and USA Women’s eight rower Meghan Musnicki.
This was Gevvie Stone’s last professional race, and she went out with a bang. Now that Rio is complete, Gevvie is applying to residency to become an orthopedic surgeon. After just finishing her second Olympic games and standing on the podium, Gevvie is now pursuing a career as a doctor. No rest for the weary, huh?
Gevvie mastered the choppy Rio course of the women’s single sculls, cruising into second and winning her first Olympic medal – a silver.
“It’s funny because people think that silver medalists are unhappy because they didn’t get gold,” said Stone to Team USA. “I’m so happy. I could not be happier. Kimmie (the gold medalist) has been on the top and to be that close to her and get the silver medal, it’s amazing.”",8/25/16
recap-whoop-athletes-in-rio-2016,Recap: WHOOP Athletes in Rio 2016,"“I watched USA really crush it this week,” Connor said. “It was time for me to hold up my end of the bargain. I wanted to contribute to the medal count. I was thinking about it the whole time.”
In the final race of his last Olympic meet, Jaeger swam a very methodical and strategic swim which he had, in my eyes, secured from the second he dove in. Never once did he panic when Italy’s Gregorio Paltrinieri stormed to the lead.
Paltrinieri, the gold medal winner, flirted with the world record early in the race but slowed at the end.
“Gregorio really took off,” said Jaeger. “You just don’t know what’s happening. Am I going slow? Thankfully, he was just going really fast. It was comforting to know no one else went with him. To kind of remain in the pack and have him go do his own thing, it allowed me to stick to my race strategy.”
“I just went into this race saying crazier things have happened than me medaling in this race,” Jaeger told NBC. “I really couldn’t have looked for a better source of inspiration than my teammates this whole week.”
As with Gevvie and Kyle, we’re honored to have helped Connor understand his Recovery patterns so that he could predict peak performance leading into the Rio Olympics.
It’s a great feeling when success comes full circle. This year Meghan Musnicki draped yet another gold medal around her neck. Meghan helped Team USA to its third straight Women’s Eight Olympic gold medal.
The Women’s Eight rowing team may be one of the most prolific teams on Team USA for their continued dominance on the water. They have won eight world championships and three Olympic titles, resulting in an undefeated record in major international competitions over that last 11 years. Meghan has been the continual team-centerpiece of what they’re now dubbing, “the Decade of Dominance.”",8/25/16
recap-whoop-athletes-in-rio-2016,Recap: WHOOP Athletes in Rio 2016,"The gold medal race was a spectacle. Racing on the finally-calm waters of Lagoa Rodrigo de Freital, Team USA started off the first 1,000 meters in third place. Then, after a few strategic moves at the 1,500-meter mark, they turned on the jets extending their lead over the second-place Canadian team by 1.72 seconds. This positioned Team USA to then close in on Great Britain who was in first. By the time they crossed the finish line they had an entire boat lead over Great Britain, proving USA’s “dominance” and closing speed.
“It was an indescribable feeling the entire way down, you could feel all nine of us fighting to push our bow ball forward,” said two-time Olympian Meghan Musnicki to Team USA reporters. “It was our goal to stay very internal because we knew it was going to be a tight race.”
Even though this team has been called a dynasty, Meghan points out that the legacy belongs to the U.S. boat, not the particular women rowing it.
“It’s easy for the outside to look in and say this team has won X number of years in a row,” Meghan said. “While it’s true that the U.S. team has, this was our second race together as a team. So this boat of nine has only won once before, in the previous heat.”
The tradition that has carried over from year to year is not the talent in the boat, but the willingness to commit themselves to their teammates and the tradition of becoming better as a rowing unit. In doing so, they’ve created one of the most iconic stories in sports – the “Decade of Dominance.”",8/25/16
recap-whoop-athletes-in-rio-2016,Recap: WHOOP Athletes in Rio 2016,"We’ve seen this storyline before. The expectation of goliath – who is heavily favored to blowout David – showing signs of faltering as the pressure rises. At the end of the first quarter of the USA Men’s Basketball final, I felt the gold medal game was up for grabs, and this traditional sports storyline was coming to fruition. Then everything changed. Team USA went on a 40-15 run and took over the lead.
What happened?
The bench took over.
Lead by Kyle Lowry and Paul George, the bench brought a more gritty, tenacious style of play that moved the ball up court, and opened up opportunities for Kevin Durant to take over. When the starters occasionally struggled, the bench came in and implemented a tough attitude that changed the game pace. Kyle played a huge role in Team USA’s success as he brought on a steadfast defensive style to the game. At the end, Olympic assistant coach, Jim Boeheim called Kyle Lowry, “The best player out of everybody.”
“He just really bought in and was a great leader and gave everything he had every time he went out there,” explained Boeheim. “That was important for our team.”
Kyle played 22 minutes, had 5 rebounds, 5 assists, 5 points, and 2 steals. However, his numbers in that game were not the reason Boeheim made that statement. Rather, it was Kyle’s tempo and attitude. We’ve seen this same grit before in the NBA Eastern Conference Finals as a player who nearly single-handedly dethroned Cleveland.
“He was our unsung hero,” Coach K said about Lowry. “He ended up being incredibly valuable, on and off the court.”
The drought has been lifted and a rare medal for Team USA has been won.
Connor Jaeger is the first American to medal in this event since Larsen Jensen in the 2004 Athens games. He took control of silver half-way through the 1500 meter freestyle, and in the process, ended up breaking his own American record.",8/25/16

2) 1-7 Days After the Marathon: Prioritize Rest and Sleep
Even the most elite marathoners take rest days after the race. A few days off (or up to a week of no running) is recommended to allow your muscular and skeletal systems to repair. Returning back to baseline will vary from person to person, but monitoring key physiological markers such as resting heart heart (RHR) and heart rate variability(HRV) will help you determine the speed at which your body is recovering. WHOOP monitors these metrics and incorporates them into your daily recovery, so you can track your body’s progress and determine when it’s time to get back to training.
It’s one thing to take a few days off from running, it’s another to make sure you’re getting quality sleep. Sleep consists of four sleep stages: Awake, light, REM, and deep sleep. Deep sleep is when your body repairs muscular and skeletal systems. Not getting enough deep sleep has a negative impact on your recovery. Adults should get at least 1-2 hours of deep sleep per night, however, your body might need more to speed the post-marathon recovery process.
Prioritizing sleep is far more important than any kind of special recovery treatment you can get, as it’s the body’s most natural and efficient way to heal.",10/11/21

4) Test Recovery Behaviors During Your Training Cycle
Supplements, meditation and other behaviors may help you recover faster after a marathon. You can test different methods while training to find one or more that works best for you.
In a survey of 14,613 WHOOP members who recorded 30 or more runs in the app in a three month period in 2021, the following recovery methods helped runners improve their daily recovery (with reduced RHR and increased HRV):
Melatonin before bed
Breathwork
Magnesium
Massage
Meditation
CBD (various forms)
Stretching
By logging when they performed these behaviors in their WHOOP Journal, members were able to see which behaviors correlated to a higher WHOOP recovery in their Monthly Performance Assessments.
It’s important to test which behaviors work for you during your training cycle so you have some go-to treatments after your marathon. For example, perhaps a 10-minute ice bath following your weekly long run helps reduce inflammation and boosts your HRV the following morning. Additional behaviors logged by WHOOP members in this survey included acupuncture, cupping, cryotherapy, and red light therapy.
Paired with quality sleep, well-rounded nutrition, and active recovery, choosing a handful of beneficial recovery behaviors will efficiently get your body back to baseline, and you’ll be even stronger for your next marathon.

1) Immediately Post Race: Hydrate, Refuel & Avoid Static Stretching
When you’ve been pounding your feet on the pavement for 2 hours (probably closer to 4 since most runners finish around that mark on average), your body has experienced a fair amount of muscle damage. You’ll likely feel the heaviness of your legs settling in once you’ve finished, and over the course of the next few days you’ll experience delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), resulting in reduced muscle strength.
Many people assume after a really long run, you should stretch and roll. However, when finishing a marathon this could cause further damage to the muscles, as you’ve already exacerbated them. It’s best to keep lightly moving and walking around, and any sort of sports massage or stretching should be done later once you’ve had plenty of time to rest and replenish.
As for replenishment, it’s important to hydrate and refuel as soon as you can with a carbohydrate-rich snack and drink (bananas, dried fruit, pretzels, or an electrolyte drink work well). Within the next 1-2 hours, a hearty, balanced meal with protein, fat, and carbohydrates will deliver key nutrients to the body and set you on the right path towards recovery.

Even if you’re taking time off from running, active recovery is still very important and will aid post-marathon recovery. What is active recovery? Active recovery focuses on low-impact exercises and movement to increase blood circulation, reawakening potentially stiff joints and tendons, and keeping you from being too antsy post-marathon.
Most coaches will say you need up to 4 weeks to recover fully from a marathon before you can return to intense training. This is a perfect time to relax without any sort of strict mileage plan in place. Instead, you can walk, bike, swim, do yoga, or try a new activity you didn’t have time for when logging all those miles. When you’re ready, you can incorporate easy 30-60 minute runs, potentially within a week of completing your marathon.",10/11/21

STEWART HAWKINS
Age: 30 Sport: Ironman Triathlon
Stewart makes recovery a big part of his training, with a 3-month average of 71%.
“The pivotal action to my recovery is sticking to a routine. A routine allows my body to learn when to recover and when to perform, so I eat, workout, and sleep at generally the same time each day. I have noticed over the years that when I deviate a few hours from my schedule, my performance in workouts, as well as my overall health and sleep quality, degrades. I also tend to have more stress.”
“The two red days before May were the result of a brick workout (around 100 miles cycling followed immediately by 17-20 miles running), and then an Ironman I did on April 22. On March 15, I did my last long workout before my race. My low recovery the following day was as expected. I really pushed hard since it was the end of my training plan before I began to taper for the race. On April 23, the day after the Ironman, my recovery was 20%. But my body bounced back quickly, with an 86% recovery April 24–signs of a good and successful training plan.”
“The first weekend in May, well, I went to the Kentucky Derby for a bachelor party. Obviously I wasn’t upholding my routine and I barely got any sleep. My recoveries were horrendous, but we had a blast.”

“I really love to geek out on my data and I’m a personal trainer as a secondary business. I teach people how to get the most out of their bodies. Drinking water and a healthy diet are key. One thing I’ve found is that eating processed foods and carbs from sugar can lead to lower Recoveries. I also eat differently depending on my workouts, with more carbs on more strenuous days.”
“In the past, I let 5 or 6 hours of sleep dictate my life. Recovery is now a big part of my day. If it’s low, I’ll adjust runs and rearrange my work schedule to accommodate sleep. Sometimes I reschedule appointments or shift my workouts to the evenings so that instead of getting up at 4 am I’ll get up at 6.”
“On the morning of May 28 (the lone red recovery pictured above), I was scheduled to do a long run. I’d been out the night before, didn’t eat well, and went to bed later than usual. I did an 8-mile run instead of 12 miles to help get my recovery back on track.”

recovery-tips-from-leading-whoop-users,Recovery Tips from Leading WHOOP Members,"Takeaways for WHOOP Users on Recovery Tips
Try to develop consistent sleeping and eating habits. This may help avoid stress, and in turn improve recovery.
Focus on hydrating (especially during and after workouts) and eating healthy foods.
In order to meet your recommended sleep need, try napping or changing your schedule when necessary.
Avoid overtraining by not going your hardest in every workout. Spend a good amount of time exercising well below your max heart rate.
On poor recovery days, look back at anything out of the ordinary you did (or didn’t do) the day before. Adjust your workouts and take on less strain to get your recovery back on track.
## How is Recovery Measured?
Recovery is reported on a 0-100% scale:
Sufficient (>67%)
Your body is well recovered and ready to perform. Whether it’s at work or the gym, your body is signaling it can handle a strenuous day. 
Adequate (34-66%)
Your body is maintaining health. You may not need rest and can still handle a moderately strenuous day.
Low (< 33%)
Your body is working hard to recover. Your body is signaling it needs an active rest day. 
## How is Recovery calculated?
Recovery is based on how fast you bounce back to baseline after a stressor like illness, strain, or stress. This baseline is based on 4 key metrics:
Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
The variance in time between your heartbeats.
Resting Heart Rate (RHR)
The number of times your heart beats per minute while at rest. 
Respiratory Rate
The number of breaths you take per minute while at rest, otherwise known as your breathing rate.
(Hours of) Sleep
The hours of sleep you get a night. Sufficient sleep gives your body time to rest and recover.",7/1/17

Besides getting the sleep I need, I take a day off from working out when I drop into the yellow for more than one day. I take advantage of my green days by going for a longer or harder ride.”
“I really like seeing my strain from workouts, or sometimes more importantly from daily life. If I have a long day at work, my WHOOP knows it. I’ll either do a greatly reduced activity day, or take the day off from training completely. The biggest thing the Strap has taught me is to let go of my ego.

Recovery is a measure of how well the body adapts to physical, mental, and emotional stress.
It isn’t a prescription on how much to work out, but rather an indicator of general well-being and your body's ability to adapt to life’s stressors.
While sleep is a big driver of Recovery it isn’t the only factor. Lifestyle choices like hydration, alcohol, diet, and socialization all influence Recovery. This is why you can have a low Recovery even with good sleep and a high Recovery even with poor sleep.

Do you adjust your training load based on your WHOOP recovery day to day?
GT: My coach and I will assess my recovery and adjust the training accordingly. Some days we simply have to do the workout that’s written, but some days we can push it off. It’s very important to listen to my body, especially in a sport like track and field, where performance is a direct result of the body’s physical state.
Pushing my body over the edge on a day where my recovery is too low may result in injury. For example, after travel days, we tend to take a rest day to allow our bodies to get back to a higher recovery before we hit it hard on the track.
Going even deeper, what about your resting heart rate and heart rate variability–do those metrics factor into any of your daily decisions?
GT: Resting heart rate and HRV definitely impact my recovery, and as a result, go into my decisions.
If you had a really hard training day today, what will you do this evening to help your body feel better?
GT: I would make sure to:
Consume a sufficient amount of protein to help repair my muscles
Get at minimum 7 hours of sleep, and usually it ends up being 8-9
Drink more water than usual and try to surpass my daily goal of 1 gallon
I’m very simple when it comes to recovery, because if I am taking care of my body in those three ways, it does a great job of repairing itself and getting stronger. If I can, I like to spend some time in a hyperbaric chamber too.
Three things Gabby makes sure to do after a strenuous day of training.
Does stretching benefit your recovery? Anything you particularly like or don’t like?
GT: After an intense training day it is critical to cool down immediately after, before leaving the track. Our muscles feel the difference the next day, and even the day after. Neglecting stretching can actually cause injury over the long term. I like to focus on dynamic stretches before a workout or before competition, and static stretching afterwards.",6/6/22

How is your sleep consistency? Is there anything else you make sure to do regularly to help keep your circadian rhythm aligned and improve your recovery overall?
GT: I would give myself an “A” on sleep consistency. I tend to stay in the range of 8 hours of sleep per night, and they are typically at the same times each night. This varies a bit when I travel or depending on my strain levels that day. On meet days, the stimulation of competition can also affect my sleep schedule.
When it gets difficult to keep my circadian rhythm aligned, like when I am traveling, I try to be very disciplined about my pre-sleep routine (as mentioned above). No caffeine after a certain time, limiting screen time, and even taking a Magnesium supplement that is certified for sport to ensure that my quality of sleep isn’t affected.

You mentioned meditating, how does that benefit you?
GT: Yes, I meditate often to lower my heart rate and reduce stress hormone levels. This helps with psychological stress and focus, and helps me to be more physically prepared for training sessions.
Along those lines, have you noticed if your mental state affects your recovery?
GT: Definitely! I’ve noticed that if I have a lot going on in my life with school or work, my stress levels increase, my RHR increases, and consequently my HRV decreases, and my recovery does as well. These are good time periods to focus on breathing exercises, meditation, and active recovery.
There are even a couple days each month during my menstrual cycle where I have heightened anxiety and lower recovery. At first, I thought I may have been imagining this, but then I started tracking my cycle and recovery, as well as my mood, and noticed that it is consistent. Even my coach notices (she doesn’t know that I’ve attributed it to my cycle, but on those days of training, she always seems to check in and have an intuition).

Is there anything else you find important for recovery as a runner that applies to your sport maybe more than others?
GT: I think when it comes to track and field, every little thing counts so much more. In track, the only variable in performance is how your body is prepared. In other sports, variables include how your competitors play or what skills you’ve worked on. With this being the case, what we put into our bodies as far as diet goes is critical.

GT: Focusing on staying hydrated has noticeably helped my recovery score stay higher generally, and I can physically feel the difference as well.
I’ve also noticed how junk food – like ordering a pizza or eating greasy, fried foods – can negatively impact my score the next day. Overall, whenever I fuel my body adequately, I haven’t seen a huge difference in any specific diet. As long as I’m getting the nutrients that I need.
Our data shows that hydration is definitely a big factor when it comes to recovery, do you have any go-to tricks to stay hydrated, or to make sure you’re well hydrated in the days leading up to competition?
GT: A big trick to staying hydrated before competition is laying off of alcoholic or sugary drinks! I personally do not drink anything with sugar in it (a lot of people are shocked by this) unless I need electrolytes on a hard training day or long competition day.

Science also tells us that getting more sleep boosts your immune system1. We know that consistent sleep is a critical driver of health and readiness to perform in work and in life. We also know that “sleep need” varies by person and by day, and our technology measures both sleep need and actual sleep better than any other wearable device2. So in the spirit of making our team healthier with WHOOP, we are rewarding our employees $100 per month when they average 85% of their personal sleep need or more. It’s one thing to say get more sleep, but it’s another thing to actually pay your team to get more sleep. Team members follow their progress together on a team leaderboard. I encourage other CEOs and leaders to think about adopting a similar policy for their companies.
I believe these are responsible policies to ensure that the people coming to work are as healthy as possible. These are uncertain times ahead given the Coronavirus and its remarkable ability to spread. We may get to a place where everyone works from home (and that could be as early as next week).

David Stern was a friend and a mentor to me. I met him when I was twenty-seven; I explained that we were building WHOOP to help athletes manage their bodies. David, having built the NBA for thirty years, told me “Just think of the value that you could create if every athletes’ career lasted even one year longer.” David became an investor and an advisor to WHOOP. I didn’t know what that would mean at the time, but I was excited to have him involved.
I called him a few months later and he didn’t answer, so I left a message. He called me back within minutes, asking “What can I do for you, Will?” I had a question about navigating one of the major pro sports leagues. He gave me great advice. At the end of our call, he said to me “You know Will, you should call me more!” He said it with a demanding and playful tone. And so just like that, I started calling him. He almost always answered right when I called and if he didn’t he called back later that day.
David Stern treated me as an equal. He went out of his way to help me and to help WHOOP. He truly cared about athlete well-being and he loved investing in technology that could tackle the mission of improving human performance. When I told him I wanted to start a podcast, he offered to be my first guest. When we were debating athlete privacy on WHOOP, he pushed for empowering the athletes first. When we were raising money, he called investors on my behalf.
I always felt like I got so much more out of our time together than he did. So I asked him, “David, why do you like investing in sports technology so much?” He said with a big smile and wide arms “Will, because it’s the future.”
David was generous and passionate for life up to his very last days. I had a celebratory WHOOP dinner with him about a week before he was taken to the hospital and, as usual, he was cracking jokes and reminding the team to stay focused.

There’s a very easy fix to resetting your circadian rhythm, or more accurately, discovering what your natural circadian rhythm actually is. The hard part is finding the time to do it:
1. Start by getting up in the morning at a time that seems normal for you. 2. Go to bed that night when you begin to feel tired. 3. The next day, do not use an alarm, just sleep until you wake up naturally.
Repeat this process for several days, and soon enough you’ll develop a consistent sleep pattern and discover exactly when your body wants to be sleeping. At this point, your sleep schedule will now fall in line with your circadian rhythm.

reset-circadian-rhythm-fix-sleep-schedule,How to Reset Your Circadian Rhythm and Fix Your Sleep Schedule,"Many of us have trouble falling asleep, feel sleepy when we wake up, and often just aren’t able to sleep when our bodies’ want us to. By resetting your circadian rhythm and following a natural sleep schedule that aligns with your internal body clock, you’ll get better, more efficient sleep and in turn improve your overall health and well being.
## Circadian Rhythm Overview
Your circadian rhythm is a 24-hour internal clock which regulates many cycles your body goes through on a daily basis, most significantly when you fall asleep and wake up. It is controlled by a part of your brain called the hypothalamus, which responds to light in the morning and tells your body to begin producing melatonin (that makes you feel tired) as it gets dark in the evening.
Circadian rhythms may vary from person to person, and they also change and evolve with age. Babies, children, teenagers, adults and elderly people all have different times that their bodies want to eat, sleep, get up, etc.
## What is Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder?
According to the National Institute of Health, “circadian rhythm disorders are problems that occur when your sleep-wake cycle is not properly aligned with your environment and interferes with your daily activities.”
Sleep-wake cycle disorders can be attributed to any number of factors, including jet lag after crossing time zones, shift work or other occupations with frequently changing hours, specific medical conditions, something as simple as going out late at night and sleeping in in the mornings on weekends, or even Daylight Saving Time.

respiratory-rate-tracking-coronavirus,The Importance of Respiratory Rate Tracking During The COVID-19 Pandemic,"Symptoms vary depending on the function of the cells that were damaged; in COVID-19, the virus infects the alveoli. Alveoli are the blood/lungs interface at which oxygen passes from the lungs to the blood and carbon dioxide passes from the blood to the lungs. Without functioning alveoli, each respiration does not remove as much carbon dioxide from the blood or provide as much oxygen to the blood as it used to. To make up for the loss of efficiency per breath, the body is forced to undergo more respirations to provide the same blood oxygen supply.",4/1/20
respiratory-rate-tracking-coronavirus,The Importance of Respiratory Rate Tracking During The COVID-19 Pandemic,"How Does WHOOP Measure Respiratory Rate?
Last year, WHOOP upgraded our sleep analytics platform to include resting respiratory rate in our web app. Earlier this year, we became the first wrist-worn wearable device to validate the accuracy of our respiratory rate measurement during sleep. In this third-party study, published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, WHOOP respiratory rate was shown to be within one breath per minute of gold-standard truth.
WHOOP reports the median respiratory rate during sleep. We calculate respiratory rate from heart rate data by taking advantage of a phenomenon known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Described simply, when we breathe in, our heart rate increases and when we breathe out our heart rate decreases, allowing us to preferentially pass blood by the lungs while they are full of oxygen. Because our autonomic nervous systems increase heart rate during inhalation and decrease heart rate during exhalation, we can see the respiratory rate in continuous heart rate data by looking for this cyclical increase/decrease pattern.

Take for example 25 seconds of my heart rate data below–you can see that the heart rate cycles up and down about every 5 seconds, corresponding to a respiratory rate of about 12 breaths per minute.",4/1/20

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, WHOOP released a fast-tracked update to our mobile apps which makes it easier for members to monitor and interpret their respiratory rates. Why? It might be the most significant metric to track if you are concerned about COVID-19.
Read on to learn more about how we measure respiratory rate and why it’s so important.
WHOOP tracks respiratory Rate while you sleep, significant changes in it may be meaningful.
## What is Respiratory Rate?
Respiratory rate, reported in respirations (breaths) per minute (rpm), typically ranges from 12 to 20 rpm at rest. Each respiration has two phases: Inhalation and exhalation. During inhalation oxygen is brought into the lungs from where it is transported throughout the body via the bloodstream, and during exhalation carbon dioxide is eliminated.",4/1/20
respiratory-rate-tracking-coronavirus,The Importance of Respiratory Rate Tracking During The COVID-19 Pandemic,"COVID-19 and Respiratory Rate
In order to understand why the coronavirus might cause elevated respiratory rate, it’s important to understand the pathology of the infection.
COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a new disease, but in most moderate to severe cases it presents as a lower-respiratory tract infection, similar to bronchitis and some strains of the flu. Lower respiratory tract infections differ from the more common upper respiratory tract infections in the part of the respiratory tract that they impact. Upper respiratory tract infections, which include most strains of the common cold, tonsillitis, and sinus infections, are primarily characterized by symptoms above the collar–runny nose, headache, sore throats. Lower respiratory tract infections take root below the larynx and therefore are more commonly associated with coughing, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
In a viral lower respiratory tract infection such as COVID-19, the virus enters the body through the nose, mouth, or eyes and travels down the respiratory tract in search of a host cell. Viruses cannot reproduce on their own and therefore need a host to “hijack,” overriding the cell’s normal function with a new command: Reproduce the virus. Once the cell is full of new virus, the cell will burst and the newly formed virus will then set out in search of even more host cells.
During the early stages of infection, often called “incubation,” there are enough healthy (not yet hijacked and destroyed) cells to compensate for their fallen neighbors, but as the number of virus organisms in the body grows, the rate at which damage is being done also grows, the healthy cells can eventually no longer cover for the burst ones, and organ function is impacted. This impact is experienced as “symptoms.”",4/1/20
respiratory-rate-tracking-coronavirus,The Importance of Respiratory Rate Tracking During The COVID-19 Pandemic,"Increased Respiratory Rate Can Be a Sign of Trouble
For this reason, respiratory rate is a useful metric because it makes it easy to spot sleeps in which “something was up.” On the other hand, RHR and HRV can meaninglessly change a few beats per minute or a few milliseconds from day to day. In statistics, this property is known as the “signal to noise ratio,” and it helps determine how much change you need to confidently conclude that a change is meaningful and not random variation. Median respiratory rate has a remarkably high signal to noise ratio, making it very easy to interpret and trust.
WHOOP tracks the increase in respiratory rate in a person diagnosed with coronavirus.
Take for example, the resting respiratory rate data of one WHOOP member, shown here with the member’s permission, as they came down with the coronavirus. This WHOOP member was exposed to COVID-19 on March 7th and began experiencing symptoms on March 11th. During the 10 days before they became sick, notice how little respiratory rate changed from night to night–it varied only from a low of 15.4 rpm to a high of 16.1 rpm. Compare this to the 11th through 13th where respiratory rate shot up to over 18.1 rpm. While in absolute numbers, this increase might not seem huge, when ordinarily stable baselines suddenly jump up over 17% that suggests something significant is going on. To view your long-term respiratory rate trends, log in to your account via our web app at app.whoop.com, then select a date range and go to “Sleep Performance” in the top right of the screen.

respiratory-rate-tracking-coronavirus,The Importance of Respiratory Rate Tracking During The COVID-19 Pandemic,"Normal Respiratory Rate Fluctuation & Why We Measure it During Sleep
In a healthy individual, it is normal for daily respiratory rate to fluctuate based on what we are doing and therefore what our acute need is for oxygen. Exercising is a great example–we breathe harder and faster when running than when standing still because while running our need for energy, and therefore oxygen, is higher.
Because variation within a day is more dramatically varied by activity level than it is by acute changes in efficiency, measuring respiratory rate throughout the day provides less insight into efficiency than does measuring respiratory rate during sleep. Since our need for oxygen is roughly constant from night to night (assuming the oxygen quality of the air is the same), you would expect respiratory rate to be the same. Therefore, when – as in the case study provided above – we see a sudden increase in sleeping respiratory rate, it is reasonable to consider changes to respiratory efficiency rather than energy need.",4/1/20
respiratory-rate-tracking-coronavirus,The Importance of Respiratory Rate Tracking During The COVID-19 Pandemic,"Why Is Respiratory Rate Worth Tracking?
Even before we started reporting respiratory rate last year, WHOOP had been tracking it throughout sleep for years. Our sleep staging algorithms use minute-by-minute changes in respiratory rate because respiratory patterns change with sleep stages. Initially, WHOOP didn’t display respiratory rate because it generally follows a similar trend as heart rate variability (HRV) and resting heart rate (RHR), so it wasn’t immediately obvious how our members would action this additional information.
However, as we gathered more data and increased the sophistication of our algorithms to improve accuracy, we discovered something interesting: While respiratory rate is generally an indicator of cardiovascular fitness and load, and therefore increases when resting heart rate increases and decreases when resting heart rate decreases, it is also a remarkably stable metric. From night to night, users should not expect to see much change in their median respiratory rate statistic. When it does change, however, that change tends to be meaningful.",4/1/20
respiratory-rate-tracking-coronavirus,The Importance of Respiratory Rate Tracking During The COVID-19 Pandemic,"High Respiratory Rate is Less Common with Other Illnesses
If you are in the US like I am, in addition to the COVID-19 pandemic it’s also still flu season, and for some of us, it’s almost allergy season. This means that there could be non-COVID-19 explanations for our coughs, fatigue or general less-than optimal feelings of wellbeing. Since most strains of the flu and most allergies primarily impact the tissues of the upper respiratory tract, elevated respiratory rate is a less common symptom; this means that if you are feeling crummy, knowing if your respiratory rate is elevated above your personal baseline may help provide useful information to help get an accurate diagnosis as quickly as possible.

respiratory-rate-tracking-coronavirus,The Importance of Respiratory Rate Tracking During The COVID-19 Pandemic,"It’s worth noting that it doesn’t have to take a deadly pandemic to increase respiratory rate. In the past few months (before we started practicing social distancing) I took a handful of overnight flights, and some of my personal highest respiratory rates happened when I was sleeping on an airplane. We’ve also observed that traveling from low to high altitude can cause an elevated respiratory rate that resolves upon return to the lower altitude; this phenomenon makes sense given the lower oxygen content of air at higher elevations.
When respiratory rate is elevated due to sleeping on a plane with stale, dry air or at altitude with lower oxygen content, that’s a response to the environment and not necessarily cause for concern. However, what we are seeing in WHOOP members self-reporting COVID-19 infections is a physiological response to the disease and therefore potentially worthy of attention.",4/1/20
resting-heart-rate-by-age-and-gender,What is a Good Resting Heart Rate by Age and Gender?,"What can resting heart rate readings indicate?
Your heart rate varies from minute to minute, but your RHR tends to remain fairly stable from day to day. Altogether, there is a wide range of normal RHR, depending on gender, age and many other factors, however, experiencing unusually high or low RHR may indicate an underlying problem.
In adults, a lower RHR is correlated with a higher degree of fitness and lower incidence of cardiac events. A consistently higher RHR may be associated with cardiovascular issues.
## How to improve RHR
Starting to improve RHR can be as easy as walking out the door. A brisk walk will elevate your heart rate during the activity and for a short period after, and exercising daily gradually decreases your RHR. Swimming, cycling, and other activities that target the aerobic heart rate zone will also help lower your RHR and benefit your overall fitness level.
## How WHOOP tracks your RHR
Monitoring RHR on your own can be quite difficult and often inaccurate. WHOOP calculates your RHR while you’re sleeping each night using a dynamic average weighted towards your deepest periods of sleep, when your body is in its most restful state. This allows for extremely reliable and consistent readings.
You can track your RHR trends in our app and note behaviors that may affect your RHR in the Journal. Additionally, WHOOP uses your RHR (along with heart rate variability, respiratory rate and sleep performance) to calculate your recovery each morning, so you can get a daily “physical forecast” for your body.

What is an unhealthy resting heart rate?
An unhealthy resting heart rate is one that is consistently above or below the normal range of 60 to 100 beats per minute. A resting heart rate that is consistently above 100 bpm may indicate a condition such as tachycardia, while a resting heart rate that is consistently below 60 bpm may indicate bradycardia. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the cause and appropriate treatment for an unhealthy resting heart rate.
### Is resting heart rate a good indicator of health?
Is resting heart rate a good indicator of health?
Resting heart rate can be a good indicator of health, as a lower resting heart rate generally indicates better cardiovascular fitness. However, there are many factors that can affect resting heart rate, such as age, medication use, and medical conditions, so it should not be relied upon as the sole indicator of overall health. Other factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle habits should also be considered.

Is 80 a healthy resting heart rate?
An 80 bpm resting heart rate is generally considered within the normal range for adults. However, what is considered “healthy” may vary based on an individual’s age, medical history, and lifestyle factors. As always, consult with a healthcare professional to determine if a resting heart rate of 80 bpm is appropriate for an individual.",6/11/21
resting-heart-rate-by-age-and-gender,What is a Good Resting Heart Rate by Age and Gender?,"Factors that affect resting heart rate
Prolonged stress can increase RHR and lead to a higher risk of heart attack and stroke. Overall, 60% of the time WHOOP members input experiencing stress (via the WHOOP Journal feature) it results in an increase in resting heart rate. Our data indicates men and women see similar changes in RHR due to stress in most age groups. Other emotions, such as happiness, can also raise your RHR.
More factors that affect RHR include:
Weight–there is a correlation between RHR and body mass index (BMI). High BMI is associated with elevated RHR according to this study.
Pregnancy can increase RHR.
Coffee and caffeinated drinks can temporarily raise your RHR.
Smoking increases RHR. Researchers at University College London found that RHR decreases by an average 5–15 bpm within a day of stopping smoking and remains at that level for at least a year.
Consuming alcohol can increase RHR.
Decongestants or allergy medications may elevate RHR.
Blood pressure medications such as Beta blockers and some migraine medications can lower RHR.
Disorders such as anemia, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can affect RHR.
Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to a lower metabolism and raise RHR.
High air temperatures and high humidity can increase RHR.

resting-heart-rate-by-age-and-gender,What is a Good Resting Heart Rate by Age and Gender?,"## What is resting heart rate (RHR)?
Resting heart rate (RHR), also called basal heart rate, is a measure of your average heart beats per minute (bpm) while your body is at rest in a neutrally temperate environment and has not been subject to recent strain. The metric is useful for monitoring your fitness level and heart health. A lower resting heart rate is usually a good sign. The average RHR is between 60-100 bpm, according to the American Heart Association.
Generally speaking, when your heart rate decreases, it means that each beat is more effective. A low RHR is a sign of a strong heart muscle that can pump enough blood to supply the body with oxygen without having to labor too hard. When your heart doesn’t need to work as hard to push blood through your body to supply oxygen to your muscles, your level of fitness increases.
## Women have higher RHRs than men
Women typically have smaller hearts than men do. As a result, each heartbeat produces less blood flow, meaning the heart needs to pump faster in order to achieve the necessary output. WHOOP data shows this translates into an average RHR about 3.5 bpm higher for females than males.
Across all ages, the average resting heart rate for women wearing WHOOP is 58.8 bpm, and for men it’s 55.2 bpm.
Since many of our members tend to be athletes and/or people who are particularly interested in monitoring their health and well-being, it’s not surprising that the normal RHR for men and women on WHOOP is below what the Center of Disease Control considers average.
## Resting heart rate by age and gender (Chart)

By Sunday, the exertion of the weekend’s events began to catch up to him, and Froning’s recovery was in the red (32%). He took a second shot at the fifth workout:
9-6-3 Snatch (185 lb.) Burpee box jump-over (30 in.)
His time, 2:17, was still among the top 20 worldwide, with his HR reaching 175 bpm.

Although his recovery was just 43%, Froning did hit 95% of his sleep need (8:05 asleep and 8:55 in bed). Below is his heart rate and various activity strains for the entire day:
Amazingly, Froning and Team Mayhem Freedom took first place worldwide in all three workouts they performed that day.
First up was workout 2, consisting of each male/female pair doing:
70 synchro GHD sit-ups 14 rope climbs, one 15-ft. rope, switch as needed 70 synchro alternating single leg squats 50 synchro GHD sit-ups 10 rope climbs, one 15-ft. rope, switch as needed 50 synchro alternating single leg squats
Their first-place time was 22:51, with Froning doing the first 10:50. His heart rate maxed out at 173 bpm.
Next, they did workout 5, a relay of:
9-6-3 Snatches (175 lb. for men, 125 for women) Burpee box jump-overs (30 in. for men, 24 for women)
The team finished in 9:49 (again, 1st) and Froning did his part in 2 minutes and 11 seconds. His heart rate only got up to 153.
Lastly, they concluded with workout 3, male and female pairs each completing:
Athlete 1: 100 wall-ball shots (20-lb. ball, 10-ft. Target for men, 14-lb. and 9-ft. For women) 120-cal. row Then athlete 2: 120 wall-ball shots 100-cal. row
Once again, CrossFit Mayhem Freedom logged the best time in the world, totaling 33:22. Froning finished his part first (in 7:47), with an average heart rate of 156 bpm and a max of 179. His HR stayed elevated for the next 10 minutes however, as he watched and eagerly supported his teammates. This is reflected in his activity time (18:04), strain (6.8) and calories burned (158) in the WHOOP app:
Day strain: 13.0
On Saturday April 24, following the completion of an epic 2-day performance by the squad, Froning’s recovery was 37%. And after taking a commanding lead in the team quarterfinals, it appears as though a ninth CrossFit Games title is well within his reach.

Froning recently took part in an AMA through our app to discuss his workouts and training, extending his career, and the insights he gains from his WHOOP data. Here are several of the highlights.
## Training, STRAIN & Workouts
Question: How many hours/sessions do you train daily? And how do you prevent injury?
Rich Froning: Usually a 3-hour session in the morning and 2 hours in the afternoon. The offseason is a lot of technique to stay healthy.
Q: Do you track individual pieces of your workout sessions or the entirety?
Rich: Depends on how lazy I am that day with starting and stopping the activity on my WHOOP.
Q: What is your average daily strain?
Rich: I average around 15 strain during the season.
Q: Have you changed your approach to training (e.g. schedule, volume, intensity) after gaining access to WHOOP data?
Rich: Not a ton during the season, but offseason yes.
Q: Are burpees the most complete exercise, if you only had to choose one?
Rich: Thruster is better.
Q: Would you rather squat with Mat Fraser or do arms with Arnold Schwarzenegger?
Rich: Arms with Arnold.

Q: What is the one piece of data from your WHOOP that you value the most?
Rich: Sleep.
Q: How many hours of sleep do you get on average?
Rich: 7-8 hours.
Q: What is your favorite recovery protocol?
Rich: Sleep. Cold plunge.
Q: What’s the weirdest thing you do for recovery that seems to work for you?
Rich: Swim.
Q: What does an active recovery day look like for you? Do you ever take complete rest days with no physical activity (or as little as humanly possible)?
Rich: I feel better when I move every day. Thursdays are usually a machine or mountain bike for an hour (weather permitting) and swim. Sundays are just one session, usually a machine (ski, bike, row). Those would be my “active recovery” days.
Q: How, if at all, has WHOOP data changed your approach to recovery?
Rich: During season not much, other than that I try to optimize those things that help me recover. Offseason I pay a lot more close attention to my recovery. I’m getting older and if I want tot extend my career, off-season is where I’m going to do it.
Q: What do you do when you feel great but your recovery is reflecting otherwise? Do you keep to your programmed training or alter it?
Rich: It’s a little bit of a mix of both.
Q: Can you tell us your protocol for getting over patella tendinitis?
Rich: Tempo back squats, 3-4 sets, 8-12 reps. 4 down, 3 up. Heavy.
Q: I know this question is a regularly asked one, but what is your recommendation for increasing one’s HRV? What works best for you?
Rich: Sleep, eating enough, and cold tub are my 3 go-to’s. Massage seems to help bring up my HRV as well.
## Supplements & Gear
Q: Are there any supplements you recommend to help with your sleep or training?
Rich: I take CBD and melatonin.
Q: What do you think about CBD for performance? Any experience about that?

risk-fear-strain-rock-climber-matt-lloyd,"Risk, Fear, and Strain: A Rock Climber’s Story","The Cool Kids of Climbing
There’s an Ernest Hemingway quote that says “There are only three sports: bullfighting, motor racing, and mountaineering; all the rest are merely games.” The truth of that statement is debatable, but the American novelist’s message is clear. True sports have an element of risk. In the case of “mountaineering,” or rock climbing to the modern man, it’s a matter of life or death.
Matt Lloyd has never known life outside of climbing. Born in South Africa, he moved to Colorado at an early age and started doing it for fun. Eventually, he went pro and began coaching at the age of 15. Back then, climbing was more of a “lifestyle” sport. Generally, people viewed it as a hobby–a thing you did if you wanted to escape society and live in your van. Even though Matt was a pro, he says the sport was largely unregulated and it wasn’t profitable as an athlete.
Today, the world of climbing has changed dramatically. In 2017, The New York Times even called it one of the fastest growing niche sports. Climbing heroes like Alex Honnold, Conrad Anker, and Jimmy Chin have caught mainstream attention through breathtaking documentaries and widespread social media followings. People are flocking to upscale state-of-the-art climbing gyms as a way to meet people and stay fit. What used to be purely a fringe lifestyle hobby has now become part of the culture of cool.
An Indoor Gym for the Outdoor Athlete
When Matt opened his gym Mountain Strong in 2013, he didn’t realize how serendipitous the timing would be. Both CrossFit and climbing were on the rise, and together with his friends they created a program for the outdoor athlete looking train smarter, build strength, and become more athletic. From kayakers to skiers to ultrarunners, Mountain Strong catered to the “outdoorsy” population of Denver in a way that no gym had before.",8/29/19
risk-fear-strain-rock-climber-matt-lloyd,"Risk, Fear, and Strain: A Rock Climber’s Story","Fear and Risk in Denver, CO
As all climbers know, there’s a dark side to the sport that you must accept if you want to be a part of the community. On average, North America sees about 30 climbing-related deaths per year, which is why it’s imperative to approach each day with warranted caution.
“There’s lots of suffering involved in it, and that’s part of what makes climbing different,” says Lloyd. “A couple of my peers die every year doing this sport. I’ve been stuck in storms at 20,000 feet. There’s a huge risk of getting hurt, and I can’t just quit in the middle of it. It’s a one shot try.”
Part of the cardiovascular strain of climbing is simply managing fear and anxiety while you’re dangling above a rock ledge. Experienced climbers like Lloyd learn to calm their nerves in order to maintain control, but there’s always an element of risk that keeps the body on high alert. Lloyd has even discovered that the night before a climb his strain will increase simply because he’s anxious.
Matt wears WHOOP because it gives him a little more peace of mind. “It’s a way to know when you’re on or off, a way to mitigate risk. We all take risks in sports, but it’s nice to have something that helps you make a better decision.”
One of those decisions has been taking actual rest days. Before WHOOP, his rest days consisted of spending a whole day doing carpentry and housework instead of climbing. Lloyd figured that because he wasn’t doing his normal activities, he was allowing his body to take time off. Instead, he was reaching an 18.5 strain spending eight hours a day doing things like raking and painting. “I learned that I have to chill out on some days, you know? It’s a different kind of stimulus,” says Lloyd, referring to the types of activities you do on rest days that your body might not be used to. Now, the otherwise “super high energy” Lloyd forces himself to take a break on rest days by reading and laying low.

Thanks to Matt, WHOOP has become a device regularly worn by athletes in his gym to help understand response to training stimuli and prepare for whatever adventures they have in the wilderness of Colorado.
“If you’re training by feel, you have the worst coach,” Lloyd states, matter of factly. “Everyone I know has had a day where you’re like ‘I feel like shit’. And then you PR.” And when it comes to scaling mountain sides or barreling down the Arkansas River in a kayak, being primed for peak performance makes it a little less scary.

risk-fear-strain-rock-climber-matt-lloyd,"Risk, Fear, and Strain: A Rock Climber’s Story","“I wanted to fill this space for people who didn’t really want to be in the gym,” says Lloyd. “The reality is that you can’t go out and climb eight hours a day, every day. You’ll get injured.” By combining high intensity training, Olympic lifting, and climbing technique, Matt provided a way to help people get stronger inside the gym so they could maximize their performance outside of it.
High Stress Situations Produce High Strain
About three years ago, Lloyd bought a chest strap to monitor his heart rate while he was climbing outside. When he got home to download the data to his computer, he was surprised to learn that his heart rate was elevated for hours on end, sometimes reaching 190 bpm. While climbing was definitely strenuous, he never would have guessed that his body was reaching anaerobic training zones like an endurance athlete.
As he started integrating technology into his training, Matt stumbled upon WHOOP after chatting with some NFL players at a sports rehab facility in Denver. WHOOP came into the conversation when players were discussing how veteran athletes with lots of experience still struggled with injury and recovery. Lloyd then purchased a WHOOP for himself and started wearing it on all his climbs to get an idea of what his body was actually going through and what his limit should be each day.
What he discovered fascinated him. While his chest strap did register elevated heart rate, it wasn’t correlated to anything actionable. With WHOOP, Lloyd started to see clear patterns of strain and recovery that became critical to mitigating risk on his climbing routes. He also began monitoring the differences in strain based on climbing difficulty, altitude, and outdoor vs. indoor routes using the WHOOP Live feature, which captures calories and strain in real-time.
Below is a typical climbing day for Matt, along with a video where he chronicles four different climbs, both inside and outside, and the differences in how it affected his heart rate.",8/29/19
road-ironman-triathlon-world-championships,My Road to the Ironman Triathlon World Championship,"“Champions keep playing until they get it done right.” – Billie Jean King
It was 1989, I was 17 years old and ABC’s Wide World of Sports was on television. Some of you may be “young” enough to remember the tagline: “The thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.” I was watching the Ironman Triathlon World Championship in Kona, Hawaii. An Ironman consists of a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride and a 26.2-mile marathon run. The Ironman World Championship starts at 7:00 am and if you don’t cross the finish line finish by 11:59:59 pm, you don’t finish.
I was intrigued that day by “The Iron War” showdown between Mark Allen and Dave Scott. They were running neck-and-neck for the marathon at a 6:06/mile pace. Allen won, with a total time of 8:09. What fascinated me even more was seeing the first-place female, Paula Newby-Fraser, finishing in nine hours flat (pictured below).
As a “non-athletic” girl from Whitewater Wisconsin (population 10,500), I told my mom, my grandpa and the rest of my family that I was going to do THAT Ironman by the time I turned 30. Seeing the World Championship race that day triggered a spark in my mind and in my heart. That spark has stayed with me ever since.
My first sprint triathlon was in 1993 in Janesville, WI. A sprint distance is generally a 400-800 meter swim, a 12-15 mile bike and a 2-3 mile run. I was a lifeguard at the time who taught swimming lessons, so I was very comfortable in the water. My mountain bike was my standard mode of transportation, so I was comfortable riding too. But I truly did not like running, so I grabbed my Nike Air Pegasus shoes and just started to run.",9/13/17
road-ironman-triathlon-world-championships,My Road to the Ironman Triathlon World Championship,"From January through April this year, I struggled with some illnesses while I was getting ready for my first race of the season, Ironman 70.3 Texas in Galveston, TX (half the distance of a full Ironman). One of the first things I noticed with my WHOOP was my Strain from being sick. I was very conscious of my Recovery. If I needed to rest longer in between workouts, I did. If I needed to move a hard interval bike session to the next day and get a light recovery swim in that day instead, I did.
Going into IM 70.3 Texas, I wasn’t in my prime, but I still managed to set a Half Ironman personal record that day and place fourth in my age group (5:16:54).
As a triathlon coach, I have seen so many athletes try to get back to training as soon as possible after a hard-effort race. WHOOP helped me realize how big a mistake that can be. Below is a sample of my WHOOP data the week of IM 70.3 Texas, which was on Sunday, April 2. My total Strain that day was a 20.6 out of a possible 21! I was 93% Recovered on the morning of the race, but take a look at what that Strain did to my Recovery Monday (61%) and Tuesday (32%):
From April to July, I was getting primed for Ironman Mont Tremblant (my chance to qualify for Kona), but I also had another Half Ironman 70.3 in Lubbock, TX. As I used my WHOOP more, I became more aware of my habits and started sleeping better. I made a few modifications to my behavior heading into Lubbock that I have WHOOP to thank for:
At the end of June, Ironman 70.3 Lubbock was exactly what I needed for my body, mind and soul. I PR’d for Lubbock (5:11:45), placed 2nd in my age group (45-49) and qualified for the Ironman 70.3 World Championship in Chattanooga, TN. I was elated and I knew this was only going to help me heading into my 12th full Ironman Triathlon.
Here is what WHOOP showed after IM 70.3 Lubbock (Sunday, June 25). It took me three days to get my Recovery back to normal:",9/13/17
road-ironman-triathlon-world-championships,My Road to the Ironman Triathlon World Championship,"The months of July and August were crucial for my training as I prepared for Ironman Mont Tremblant. I trained hard–my Day Strains were consistently higher than my Recoveries:
However, as the Ironman neared, I cut back my training and focussed on being properly recovered. The week of the race, my daily Strain closely mirrored my daily Recovery. When race day came on Sunday, August 20, I was ready for a peak performance:
That day was truly epic for me. Here’s the shortened version of the 10 hours, 59 minutes and 31 seconds I spent on the course, a PR for me for an Ironman Triathlon:
I swam well during the 2.4-mile swim with a time of 1:13:54. I biked a smart race during the 112-mile ride, staying within my power and on top of my nutrition, a time of 5:53:32. I ran solidly during the 26.2 marathon with a time of 3:42:09, averaging 8:28/mile AFTER the swim and bike.
Something interesting that I’ve realized during the last three years of my training–I freaking LOVE the run in triathlons now. I’ve become good at it. Really good at it, unlike that kid who hated running back in 1993! The run is my JAM. I knew I could catch women in my age group when it got to that point and I did. I honestly had no idea where I was at when I crossed the finish line, but when I heard Mike Reilly say to me, “Jennifer Rulon. You. Are. An. Ironman.” I knew in my heart that I’d had the race of my life.
After the race, I saw my husband, my sister in law, Vikki, my nephew, Jaxson, and my niece, Taryn. They told me how amazing I was. Vikki asked if I wanted to know how I’d done. “Yes, please!” I said. She told me, “Jen, you placed 3rd in your age group and Chris, you placed 2nd in your age group.” I broke down into tears. Taryn asked me, “Aunt Jennifer, are you going to Kona?”
“I hope so baby,” I said. “I hope so.”",9/13/17
road-ironman-triathlon-world-championships,My Road to the Ironman Triathlon World Championship,"At the award ceremony the next day, I chatted with the ladies in my age group. There were two slots to Kona for my group. The women in first already had a slot. I learned that the women in second wasn’t planning to go to Kona. That meant I was.
When I went up on stage to receive my award, I knew I was on my way to the Ironman Triathlon World Championship in 2017, along with my husband, Chris, who also qualified. After the ceremony I got to tell my niece Taryn, “Yes baby, I am going to Kona.”
Less than an hour after the award ceremony, it was time to hand out the Ironman Triathlon World Champions slots. Over the PA system, Mike Reilly’s iconic voice asked people if they wanted the slot to Kona, Hawaii. After 12 Ironman Triathlons and 15 years of trying to qualify for the World Championship, I heard him say to me…
“Hey Jen, you want to go to Kona?”
Since that day, my training has been all about rest and recuperation. Yes, I have the World Championship coming up in less than five weeks, but I already did the hard part. I got a slot.

road-ironman-triathlon-world-championships,My Road to the Ironman Triathlon World Championship,"As I started aging up, it started getting harder! My competitors’ times were getting faster. In the sport of triathlon, a lot of athletes focus more on what they want when they get older. They become “smarter” physically and mentally. If you compare the times from my first Ironman in 2002 to my 12th in 2017, I have improved by almost three hours.",9/13/17
road-ironman-triathlon-world-championships,My Road to the Ironman Triathlon World Championship,"I ran one mile through the center of town and then headed back to my mom’s house. That was how I started training for my first triathlon. Later, when I crossed the finish line that first time, I was hooked. I knew I would achieve that goal I’d set for myself four years earlier. From 1993-2002, I competed in roughly 25 triathlons of varying lengths. I ran more. I replaced the mountain bike with a road bike, then the road bike with a triathlon bike. Eventually I got a triathlon coach to get ready for my first Ironman.
I am proud to say that on September 14, 2002, six weeks prior to my 31st birthday, I did my first Ironman Triathlon in Wisconsin.
Completing an Ironman Triathlon has got to be one of the BEST feelings in the world. Why? To me, it was the defining moment of being an athlete. In high school and college, I never considered myself “athletic.” In the triathlon world, whether I was a male or a female, whether I finished in eight hours, 16 hours and 59 minutes, or any time in between, I was accepted as an athlete because I crossed the finish line of an Ironman. As triathletes, we all encountered the same distance, dealt with the same weather elements, and had the same desire to cross the finish line after 140.6 miles and hear those famous words from Mike Reilly (the voice of Ironman Triathlon): “You. Are. An. Ironman.”
While I did my first Ironman when I was 30, I still remembered what I told my mom, my grandpa and my family–I was going to do THAT Ironman, the World Championship in Kona, Hawaii. To get there, I had to qualify. As a female triathlete, I needed to be in the top two of my age group at an Ironman Triathlon sanctioned race. There are over 40+ Ironman Triathlons to qualify at. I had to find one where I felt I could do it.",9/13/17

8-year sabbatical–let me explain: After the death of my dad and multiple miscarriages, the thought of being on my bike or running for hours on end made me hate the sport. What I realized after these tough moments in my life was that I still needed to take care of myself, both physically and mentally. I didn’t want to be spending hours a day getting ready for ANOTHER Ironman. I found CrossFit instead and drank the Kool Aid. With CrossFit, I finished working out within an hour, I got stronger, lost weight that I needed to and loved the community that I was in. It kept my mind off of things that I really didn’t want to tackle at the time.
Then in 2012, I actually went to Ironman Kona and witnessed my husband Chris participate. The fire inside me was lit once again, just like in 1989.

The training is still the same and the goal is still the same – peaking and going as fast as I can for 2000 meters. WHOOP is helping me move toward this goal by helping me prevent overtraining because I will have to peak in both the semifinal and in the final. There are enough fast women out there that you can’t wait until the end to show your cards. If I can do this in the Olympics, then these games will be a success.”",7/27/16

Sleep seems to be the running theme elite athletes are concerned about. The increase of sponsorship dollars, media buys, and overall demand on elite athletes is creating a perfect storm of lost sleep. Understanding the effects of sleep deprivation on athletic performance has been widely studied in the academic world, but it’s only now that this is becoming more of an issue as this so-called “sleep storm” increases.
The value Gevvie places on sleep wasn’t always there. Gevvie jokingly told me that she used to laugh at her teammates that were strict about getting their nine hours of sleep. “I was like, come on guys, live a little!”
It wasn’t until Gevvie started to master every facet of her sport that she started looking elsewhere for improvement. “The British rowing team has a 1% theory, just get 1% better at everything. Sleep, nutrition, stretching, rowing…everything. If you’re 1% better in the little things, it will add up to more than 1% in the water, which is the difference between 6th and 1st.”
Now Gevvie finishes her morning workout, has a quick breakfast – which she proudly admits she can eat fast to maximize sleep time – and then heads back to bed. “As soon as breakfast is over, I’m back to sleep before my afternoon lift.” A typical conversation between Gevvie and her coach goes like this:
“Sorry, I’m a little late, coach. It took me a little longer to get out of bed.”
“What do you mean? You were up 2 hours ago.”
“I mean from my nap.”
“Gevvie, it’s 10:30 am, you already took a nap?” “Yes.”",7/27/16
rowing-to-rio-how-gevie-stone-predicts-peak-performance,Rowing to Rio: How Gevvie Stone Predicts Peak Performance,"Gevvie’s need for sleep doesn’t just extend from night to early morning, rather it’s a mentality she holds constant throughout her day. The sleep insights WHOOP has revealed has changed the way sleep fits into her training and recovery. “I just assumed that if I went to bed around 10:00pm and woke up at 5:00am that I was getting 7 hours of sleep. After wearing WHOOP, I realize I’m really only getting about 6 and ½ hours of sleep, which sounds a lot less than 7.”
“I now start getting ready for bed at 9:00pm. I’m probably in bed at 9:15 – 9:20 on an average night which makes a big difference because it pushes my sleep above 7 hours, which is important. I’ve seen more than a 1% change in my sleep, which is great. And if I can get more than 1%, I’ll grab it.”",7/27/16
rowing-to-rio-how-gevie-stone-predicts-peak-performance,Rowing to Rio: How Gevvie Stone Predicts Peak Performance,"Entering high school, Gevvie actually resisted joining the rowing team. She thought to herself, “this is what my parents do. I want to do something different.” But after a few seasons, she began to acknowledge that maybe her hand-foot-eye coordination wasn’t one of her sweet spots. “Soccer was really not my sport so I switched over to rowing, which proved to be a good decision,” Gevvie said. “I learned to love it on my own terms. My parents didn’t push me into it and I personally made the decision to transition myself from soccer and lacrosse to rowing.”",7/27/16

Just like most endurance sports, pushing your body to the brink of exhaustion is something that is commonplace, especially in rowing. This training mindset magnifies the significance of the need for recovery in an athlete’s overall training regimen. In Gevvie’s case, she begins to notice a difference in her recovery scores as the week goes on. Monday looks great, Tuesday looks better, then there is a slow decline through the remainder of the week, which is to be expected. “As long as my WHOOP Recovery Score starts to improve over the weekend, then I don’t worry too much.”
Gevvie’s recovery includes a healthy dose of WHOOP analytics that helps her predict performance. “If my resting heart rate (RHR) is above 52 then I may be getting sick because it’s usually 48-49 pretty consistently.” In addition to her RHR, Gevvie pays close attention to her Heart Rate Variability (HRV), as it fluctuates more during her recovery. “When I came back from racing in Europe it took me a long time to get my HRV back up. Despite having a recovery week, my HRV was below 50 for 2-3 weeks. Since I’ve been wearing WHOOP, HRV has been a good measure of my training fatigue, and my resting heart rate has been a good measure of whether I’m about to get sick or not.”",7/27/16

The air is cool for a July morning, slightly damp, and the river is amazingly still, like glass. In the distance, all I can hear is the combination of oars hitting the water and fiberglass boats skimming over it.
I’m at an early morning training session for one of the best Olympic rowers in the world. Genevra Stone – Gevvie for short – is a two-time Olympian who lives in Boston and trains on one of the most iconic rowing rivers in the world. We met her at the Harvard row house, a building with dark mahogany walls, creaky floorboards, large banisters, and white light that gleamed through the high windows. I felt like I was walking through a hall of champions rather than a training center.
Growing up, going to med school, and training in Boston, Gevvie is a Beantown girl at heart. “There was a crossing guard in the apartment I lived above for 6 years and we’d see each other every morning as I walked to the T,” Gevvie says. “Every morning we’d have a 1-minute conversation about the weather and what’s happening in the sports world. I love that because that’s what people in Boston do, we share the bond of whatever sport is in season and how miserable the weather is. But we have it pretty good as far as I can tell.”
At a young age, Gevvie was always around rowing. Her parents were both on the US national rowing team in the 70s so the lifeblood of the sport carried from generation to generation. Every Fall, Gevvie’s parents would bring her into Boston for the Head of the Charles – the biggest rowing regatta in the world. Gevvie and her sisters would play around the docks while their mom and dad would compete. “As a kid, I was definitely aware rowing was a tight-knit and special community. But instead of watching the races I always found myself a little distracted by the caramel apples.”",7/27/16

Gevvie’s passion for rowing shines through her training. Her precision from beginning to end has rightfully given her the elite status of a champion. She does triple sessions Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, which consists of a morning row, afternoon lift, and another row in the evening. Tuesday and Thursday she rows twice, Saturday she rows in the morning with an additional afternoon row or bike. Sunday is Gevvie’s “active rest” day so she practices yoga. In total, when Gevvie is in full training she is working out 16 times per week.
With a high volume training plan such as this, I had to ask the question: ‘Where does train smarter not harder come into play?’ Gevvie says, “Since rowing is an endurance power sport, you have to put a certain amount of miles and minutes in. No one trains once a day and is the fastest in the world. You have to put in enough minutes and you have to watch what you’re doing when you’re not training. That’s where the “smarter” comes in. Everyone puts in about the same load on the water so it’s really what you’re doing off the water that matter – taking those naps, getting enough sleep at night, stretching, foam rolling, going to physical therapy, eating right. The little things make a big difference.”",7/27/16

“The biggest benefit for me is tracking my sleep,” said Conor, who’s been a WHOOP member for about two years. “It’s something I struggled with before in not knowing about fatigue, sleep cycles, I wasn’t getting enough deep sleep or REM sleep. WHOOP has been incredibly helpful for me in terms of getting into a good, healthy sleep routine and winding down before bed. It’s really improved my energy levels the next morning.”
Given the physical stress these players are putting their bodies through on a daily basis, sufficient deep sleep (the physically restorative stage of sleep) is crucial in helping them to bounce back. Furthermore, ample REM sleep (the mentally restorative stage) is also critical given how technically challenging the game is.
Anthony Watson uses WHOOP to better understand how much sleep his body needs to keep up with training demands.
“In rugby, a lot of emphasis is on recovery and recovering well,” Conor added. “When we have big training days my WHOOP strain tends to be quite high, so that kick starts my recovery program, whether its recovery pumps, ice baths, or just getting my sleep hygiene right. You see the value of this through the recovery data on WHOOP.”

rugby-conor-murray-anthony-watson,International Rugby Stars Conor Murray & Anthony Watson Unlocking Performance with WHOOP,"The Physical Toll of World-Class Rugby
Rugby is a high-impact, high-intensity sport that is incredibly physically demanding on players’ bodies. Comparable to American football (with no padding) in terms of the level of physical contact, it differs when it comes to the style of play. Whereas plays in American football tend to be sprint-like and in short bursts with downtime in between, rugby is nonstop.
In rugby the game generally only pauses when the ball goes out of play, or when there is a score or penalty. With little opportunity to rest, players need to be extremely aerobically fit in order to maintain high-intensity efforts. Over the course of an 80-minute game, depending on position players can cover 4-5 miles (7-8 kilometers), hitting max speeds of up to 22 miles per hour (36 kph). Additionally, with the sport being so contact heavy (players generally don’t travel more than 5-10 steps without getting nailed by a tackle) having enough size and strength to deal with immense physicality is a must.
Elite-level rugby players are among the fittest and strongest athletes in the world when it comes to field sports. A mix of power, speed and technical ability are all required to perform at the highest level.

Training to become an elite-level rugby player is no mean feat. It’s generally a blend of strength and power-based gym sessions, as well as speed, endurance, and game-specific training on the pitch. Two-a-day sessions are quite common, and sometimes three.
“With rugby and the contact element, we do go through quite a lot of strain on the big training days, so knowing what I’ve done that day and how it might impact my sleep or recovery is huge,” Conor said. “Since using WHOOP, I’ve got a better understanding of how I need to recover in order to get my body in prime shape to train twice through contact during the week and play a game on the weekend.”
With such varying demands placed on the players’ bodies each day, they need to be incredibly resilient and able to adapt to constantly changing stimuli. Having a tool like WHOOP that allows them to track their heart rate variability and understand what factors both positively and negatively impact it is hugely important.
“I’ve been using WHOOP for just over a year now,” noted Anthony. “I’ve found it incredibly useful in managing how much recovery and sleep I need and also when I can ramp up my training further. Being able to use it in conjunction with the coaches at my club is invaluable in my attempts to foolproof my body and make further gains.”

Each of the past three years William has accomplished a major endurance event to honor his mother’s memory and raise money for charity.
## Ultra Running to Battle Cancer
Two years ago in 2019, William ran 850 miles across the length of the British Isles. Last year, William did his own take on the “12 Days of Christmas” by running a dozen consecutive marathons over the 12 days leading up to the holiday.
William had planned to run across 45 countries in Europe in 30 days, but unfortunately COVID restrictions made that impossible. Instead, he decided to adapt his fundraising event to stay in his home country in 2021. The result?

How did he handle those double-marathon days?
“Fuel wise I’d have a light breakfast, usually cereal and some fruit,” William told us. “Then I would go out for an hour-and-a-half to two hours, hoping to cover 10-13 miles. Then at that first stop I’d [eat] something more substantial, a pastry, more fruit, maybe some toast or eggs. Then out for another hour-and-a-half hoping to reach 20 miles. After that I’d have a sandwich or pasta, a protein bar, something salty like crisps or nuts. Then I’d go for the last six miles and get back to a cooked meal. I’d eat that then go for a nap. Once I woke up it was taking on sugars and caffeine to go and do another one, basically the same as the first!”
William spent the 30 days living, sleeping, and recovering in a specially equipped van, with the aid of a three-man support crew. “I planned the routes the year before, trying to make them as flat as possible,” he explained. “The camper and the team were never too far away.”

running-heart-rate-zones-safety-monitoring,What is a Good Running Heart Rate?,"Running Heart Rate Zones are Based on Your Max Heart Rate
Your running heart rate zones are based on a percentage of your max heart rate. For example: a 35-year-old’s moderate HR would be between 129-148 bpm.
The first step in using heart rate zone training for running is to figure out your max heart rate. You can calculate it using a formula such as the Tanaka or Gulati, or more simply subtract your age from 220. Using the latter method, a 35-year-old’s max heart rate is 185 bpm.
Once you know your max heart rate, you can establish your heart rate training zones and start planning your runs based on the average heart rate you want to reach.
Zone 1: 50-60% of your max heart rate. Your effort in Zone 1 will be very light, warm-ups or cool-downs as well as recovery runs.
Zone 2: 60-70%. This is the zone you want to maintain for your weekly long run. You can hold a conversation if you run with a partner or in a group.
Zone 3: 70-80%. This is a moderate pace, and your breathing is coming faster but still steady. It’s best for tempo runs, hills, and threshold training. You can still speak in complete sentences but holding a conversation might be difficult.
Zone 4: 80-90%. This should be your racing pace for a 5k, as well as speed intervals and fartleks. You won’t be able to speak in sentences at this pace.
Zone 5: 90-100%. In Zone 5 you’ll hit your max heart rate and your VO2 max–the maximum amount of oxygen your body can utilize during exercise. This is the zone you want to be in to finish your race or for shorter speed work like 200 and 400-meter sprints. In Zone 5 you probably won’t be able to speak.

running-heart-rate-zones-safety-monitoring,What is a Good Running Heart Rate?,"Maintaining a Safe Running HR
The most important aspect of heart rate zone training is to maintain a safe heart rate during your run. In addition to your age and the weather, your running heart rate is influenced by:
Fitness level: If you’re a runner or work out regularly, you’ll likely have a lower resting heart rate than a non-active person.
Medication use: Beta blockers or thyroid medications may affect your normal heart rate.
Stress: Your emotional state may quicken or slow your heart rate.
Hitting your maximum heart rate for long periods of time can be dangerous to your health and may increase your risk of cardiac events, according to one study. For these reasons, you might want to slow your pace if you’re consistently reaching your max heart rate while running.
## Track Your Heart Rate While Running with WHOOP Strain Target
Using a heart rate monitor is the easiest way to know your HR while running. The WHOOP Strain Target tracks your live heart rate and also lets you know which heart rate zone you’re in while exercising.
Additionally, the Strain Target gives you recommendations for your daily exertion based on your recovery and strain you’ve already accumulated. When you start an activity, it shows your strain building in real time towards the suggested goal, as well as how many calories you’re burning. It enables you to better understand if you should continue to push yourself, or if you’re overdoing it, allowing you to make informed decisions in the moment.

running-heart-rate-zones-safety-monitoring,What is a Good Running Heart Rate?,"Your heart rate increases during any physical activity, including running. That makes it a good measure of how much you are pushing yourself during exercise to reach your fitness goals. Monitoring your heart rate during running can help you maintain your intensity while keeping it in a safe zone.
Below we’ll get into the benefits of heart rate run training, measuring your ideal heart rate, safe heart rate limits, and monitoring your heart rate while running with WHOOP.
## Heart Rate Training vs. Pace Training
Both heart rate training and pace training have their benefits for preparing for a race. Pace training is tailored to a goal pace, so for example your plan may be to run a 9-minute mile to prepare to run a 5k race in 27 minutes. You may want to do a tempo run at a 9 minute mile and an easy run at 10:45.
But, these goals don’t take into consideration poor recovery days, hot or humid weather, and other variables like heart rate training does.
Both types of training can be used in conjunction to create a comprehensive run training plan that takes your body into consideration.
## Benefits of Heart Rate Training
Heart rate training uses your heart beats per minute (bpm) as a guide to hitting running intensities instead of training at a specific pace. The goal of heart rate training is to push your aerobic system without overexerting yourself, reducing the risk of overtraining, fatigue, and injuries.
The benefits of heart rate training include:
Recovery: You’ll know how to pace your easy runs so you can recover more efficiently and be ready for your next hard run or race.
Flexibility: Your resting heart rate can be 20% higher in hot weather, humidity, and at high altitude. Your typical Zone 2 pace may put your heart rate into Zone 3 or 4. Training at pace in these conditions could elevate your heart rate into a dangerous zone.",3/17/22

And how close/days removed should a leg day be from a long run? Emma: Depending on the focus of the session I would sometimes pair strength with a run day. For example if my goal is for the client to hit paces under fatigue I may put a run session after weights to challenge that. Otherwise after speed or interval sessions I try to give a rest day or low intensity as it allows the muscles to recover better. For a long run, say it’s on a Sunday, I would do strength work Friday and have a rest day Saturday before Sunday. In the final few weeks of the plan, as you taper for the race, I would reduce the strength sessions and put them three days before the long run to enable you to recover more!

I have either gone on the run and felt awful and taken 2-3 days to get out the red after it, or in the past even picked up a little strain or niggle. So nowadays I think to myself, One missed run does not mean a failed plan! If you need the extra recovery day, put all your energy into making it just that–hydrate well, maybe take a nap if you can, and see how it benefits you.
Q: Are there aspects of recovery that can be enhanced by other forms of activity (e.g. walking, yoga, etc.)? How helpful are these activities? Emma: I find yoga really beneficial for me, mainly due to the focus on breathing. Breathwork has made a big difference to my recovery and so doing it within yoga practices I have noticed it even more. I find my RHR is lower and my HRV is a lot higher the day after I’ve done breath work so even 5-10 minutes can make the difference for mind and body!

Question: From your experience, what impacts recovery most? Long runs or interval and track training days? Emma Kirk-Odunubi: I would say they both come in very close! From continuous intensity the interval days would be the most consistent as they always put me at a high strain because of their nature. Plus, I run my intervals in the evening too, which I find I struggle to wind down from so next day’s recovery isn’t always optimal. In saying that however, if I’m doing a long run of 20-30 km+ my body feels that for a few days. I especially notice that my RHR can stay slightly elevated.

Emma: Overtraining and poor running mechanics. Overtraining is one I have personally experienced, where before having WHOOP I would just keep pushing my body and not focusing on my recovery. It meant with limited recovery I was overreaching and my muscles and tendons weren’t having it! So pay attention if you’ve been in the red for a couple of days and reduce your load. Running form is another one to consider-looking at your cadence and stride length, and checking if it is optimum for you.
Q: I struggle with the impact on my knees from running and the inflammation it causes, but I’m looking to build back up into it. Do you have any recommendations on how best to gradually build up into running and how to manage any inflammation from it? Emma: The knees are highly impacted by our stride length and particular overstride. Striking the ground with our feet too far in front of the body (whether forefoot or rearfoot strike) can increase the excess force that happens to the joints. Look at shortening your stride and upping your cadence to help with this. Otherwise, do as much quad and hamstring strength work as you can, too!

sailors-optimize-training-olympics,Training with WHOOP for Elite-Level Sailing,"Personalized Self: Training and Fitness
Fitness and training is key to every athlete’s success and that is no different in the sport of sailing. Between sailing on the water and training in the gym, the Skiff Squad spends anywhere from 30 to 40 hours per week honing our bodies and minds. Since the weather plays a large role in when we can go sailing, the time spent in the gym is erratic and setting a rigid workout and recovery schedule is quite difficult.
Because of this, the Squad relies on WHOOP to help personalize daily gym training and evening recovery. Based on strain from an early morning sailing session or a late evening gym workout, we are able to use continuous heart rate monitoring to dictate what types of workouts we need to be doing. Or, how long we should be on the water to best optimize our energy levels on a day to day basis.
Sailor Hans Henken’s heart rate and activities, tracked by WHOOP, across a typical training day.
It’s a balancing act between getting the necessary time on the water, learning the sport-specific skills, and training in the gym to maintain the fitness level necessary to sail at this level–and WHOOP is right in the middle of it all, helping guide the decision making along the way. We don’t have full-time personal trainers to help monitor and tell us when to work out and when to take a break. Instead, we have WHOOP to lead the conversation and enable us to make educated decisions about our bodies.

## The Men’s 49er Squad
The US 49er Skiff Squad is made up of three independent teams (two people each) consisting of six individual sailors who train, travel, live, fundraise and compete with each other all over the world.
Even though only one team out of the three is able to represent our country every four years, we work together in an unmatched team-to-team relationship and unparalleled squad training dynamic in the pursuit of sustained excellence at the highest level of competition. Since the creation of the Skiff Squad in 2016, all three teams are internationally ranked within the top 20 and nationally ranked as the top three.
## How WHOOP Optimizes Our Training
WHOOP has played a critical role in supporting the Skiff Squad’s ascent to the top of the 49er Skiff Class through personalized self training, optimization of travel and event preparation, and the testing of the last piece of equipment left to tap into: The human element. As well, WHOOP has become vital to the squad’s safety during COVID-19.",5/14/21
sailors-optimize-training-olympics,Training with WHOOP for Elite-Level Sailing,"Self Monitoring and Safety
With the introduction of WHOOP teams, we took advantage of our competitive mindset and applied it to self monitoring. Consequently, constant morning check-ins inadvertently led to a first line of defense against COVID-19. On a daily basis, we enjoy battling, competing and pushing each other to get the highest strain, best recovery, and the longest sleep on our team.
The sailors are on a WHOOP team together where they compare daily strain, recovery and sleep stats.
With the arrival of COVID-19, our WHOOP team took on a completely different meaning and role. Instead of waking up and looking for who had the best sleep and recovery, we now use the team to help self-monitor each other’s baseline recovery metrics as potential early warning signs of COVID-19.
Since we all spend the majority of our time living and training together, each person having the ability to look at everyone’s baseline metrics helps to quickly prevent the infection of the entire squad through self isolation, and ultimately avoid the spread of COVID-19 to others associated with our training group.",5/14/21
sailors-optimize-training-olympics,Training with WHOOP for Elite-Level Sailing,"Equipment Testing: The Human Element
Unlike many other sports, sailboat racing requires a large amount of time devoted to equipment testing. Sometimes the difference between winning and losing comes down to the quality of a sailor’s equipment, so no rock is left unturned in the never-ending pursuit of equipment optimization.
Sailors are constantly pouring over data analysis, from their carbon fiber masts to their kevlar and mylar sails, to find “that inch” on the race course. With WHOOP, the Squad now has similar data on the most important equipment we have: Our bodies.
Data acquisition and analysis was already an essential part of our training. Now we use WHOOP data to test ourselves in unique and interesting ways to better understand our bodies. Whether it is personalizing diets with specific food groups to promote green recoveries, or setting exact times for when to begin blocking blue light to decrease sleep latency and increase REM and deep sleep, we’re always looking for that extra edge.
Tracking blue-light blocking in the WHOOP JOURNAL, and the impact it has on HRV and recovery.
Since the squad has six members, we are able to talk and share experiences and data with each other to speed up the learning process, much like what we do when training on the water.
Our current area of detailed exploration is in relation to travel. Sailing requires a great deal of travel time and we are testing theories and hypotheses on how to best maintain high recovery scores when on the road. This enables us to hit the water sooner after arriving at a new training or event venue. Our biggest discoveries so far, drinking the right amount of water and achieving a particular level of strain to induce blood flow, have been key to helping get us from airplane to sailboat.

Sailing is an endurance sport of both the mind and body. Its athletes compete in events that are on average six days long in an environment constantly changing due to the weather. Sailors have to be ready to perform at any time of the day, making it incredibly important to “know yourself.”
Being able to assess when it’s time to ramp up the intensity or slow down and conserve energy at any given moment is one of the key attributes that WHOOP has provided the Squad. The need to produce an optimal performance day in and day out over the course of an event is part of the formula for success on the racecourse. WHOOP contributes necessary information for us to make calculated decisions on our daily recovery and mindset in order to not only be “in the green” on Game Day, but for six Game Days in a row.

We also like graphics that we remember. The WHOOP technology allows me to come away with a picture of how well rested I am, how fit I am, how I’m performing.”
He also tells a story of how WHOOP can help soldiers look out for each other, in turn enabling them to function better as a unit:
“The most constructive use of peer pressure that I’ve ever seen was when I went through basic training at Fort Knox. We realized real quick that if someone in the platoon wasn’t complying with the drill sergeant’s vision, everyone was going to suffer. Peer pressure can work in a constructive manner, especially when it comes to exercise and team performance. Whether you’re monitoring your team or crew, making people accountable for their fitness is important–you can all live healthier.”
Simply put, no matter who you are, “better data means better decisions,” Parker says.

saluting-the-worlds-best-tactical-athletes,Saluting the World’s Best Tactical Athletes,"Kevin “Kit” Parker first heard of WHOOP when a student of his at Harvard came to him “with some technical questions” about the product he was developing. “I was encouraging them to consider sleep,” says Parker. “Sleep plays a crucial role in performance and everyone in America is short on sleep.”
Parker is not your ordinary Harvard professor (if there is a such a thing). In addition to being the Tarr Family Professor of Bioengineering and Applied Physics, and director of the SEAS Disease Biophysics Group, Parker is also a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve. Parker began serving in the Army in 1992 and had two tours of combat duty as a paratrooper in Afghanistan following the attacks of September 11, 2001.
In 2011, he returned for two more missions as part of the Gray Team. “We investigated traumatic brain injuries,” Parker says, “and the doctors found that sleep deprivation often exacerbated them. I’ve been in the Army for 20-something years and I’ve been over to Afghanistan several times, I think what we’ve learned the hard way in the military is that the lack of sleep will break you down.”
Now a member of the WHOOP Advisory Board, Parker believes the Strap can have a great number of benefits for those in the military:
“If I’m a special forces team leader and I have all this data on my soldiers, I can call my higher ups and say something like ‘We are green on everything except sleep. Everyone in my platoon is short on sleep. We need to sit them down for a few days.’ Right now we don’t have a system for that. There may also be members of your unit who are performing where they need to be, but the physiological metrics are telling a different story. When you dig deeper, something is wrong. They may be worn out by stressors we have a hard time understanding. I know as a combat leader myself I would love to have that kind of data about my soldiers.”",5/28/17

Sam finished a disappointing 18th at his Regional and failed to qualify for the Games. Again he was battling an injury, this time a tear to his pectoral muscle that he suffered two weeks before the competition started.

Below is a nine-month trend graph of Sam’s resting heart rate. There’s a clear dip that corresponds with his increased HRV in March and April, followed by a significant spike in May:
The stress of training for Regionals, combined with his body trying heal itself from the torn pectoral muscle while simultaneously taking on large amounts of Strain, was likely more than Sam could handle. He also mentioned to us on multiple occasions that although he did not feel personally stressed about training for Regionals, he worried very much about the athletes he coaches (like James), and not being able to devote enough of his time to them.
When we showed all of this data to Sam after the fact, he was surprised by how clearly he could tell where things went wrong. At the time, he felt as though he was doing everything he could to best prepare himself for the Games. Looking back, he saw the signs of overtraining.",7/28/17
sam-dancer-training-elite-data,Sam Dancer: Lovable Modern-Day Viking with Elite Training Data,"Sam told us that normally he tries to match his daily Strain with his daily Recovery, literally filling the two circle graphics on the WHOOP app equally (as pictured above). However, during the Open he said he wasn’t overloading his body with a lot of volume training, instead focussing on peaking specifically for each workout one at a time. He made his Open qualifying efforts his heavy workout each week, and primarily rested otherwise.
Sam’s upward trend in heart rate variability during this time looked very promising:
Following the Open portion of the competition, Sam had the 14th-best score worldwide, easily good enough to move on to Regionals. It was also the best Open of his career–he was 81st in the world after the Open in 2015, and 32nd in 2016.
Sam’s Regionals took place May 26-28 in Nashville, Tennessee. In the two months prior he did a fair amount of travelling, including a trip out west to California, and another east to Boston. Sam had a lot on his plate during what is an extremely demanding time for the athletes training for Regionals, both physically and mentally.
The workouts they’d be competing in were announced in early May, giving them very little time to prepare. And unlike the Open, they only have one shot to get it right. This scenario makes it very tempting for them to overtrain in an effort to perfect each workout as fast as possible. Imagine a musician trying to learn a new piece of music a few weeks before a performance, but every time he practices it it takes an enormous physical toll on his body.
For example, Sam and the other participants found out on May 8th that they would be doing an 80-pound dumbbell snatch in Regionals. A short time later, Sam posted this video on his Instagram account depicting him practicing with 120-pound dumbbells:

Sam referred to the fracture in his leg as “annoying” and speculated that it might have been caused by overtraining prior to the Games. However, Sam is still extremely proud of his accomplishments after the injury, calling it a “podium finish” considering what he went through. To be able to push through the pain mentally and achieve the levels of success that he did is one of his greatest achievements.
In a 2016 Games Behind the Scenes video, Sam describes how he qualified a year earlier than he expected.
His analogy with the cups exemplifies exactly who he is–Sam cares deeply about many things and has a lot of cups to fill. You can see the pain in his eyes as he discusses the sacrifices it would take to win.
This year, Sam began using WHOOP as a tool while he trained for the 2017 Games season.
The first stage of qualifying, called the Open, took place over five weeks from February 23rd through March 27th. During that time, a new workout was released online every Thursday at 8 pm. Athletes had four days to complete each one, and they could do it in their own gyms on their own timeframe. The Open is a low-pressure situation–if you don’t nail a workout right away, you can keep trying until you get it right.",7/28/17
sam-dancer-training-elite-data,Sam Dancer: Lovable Modern-Day Viking with Elite Training Data,"“It’s so easy to get suckered into the idea that you need to do more, do more, do more,” Sam said. “You think the only way to get results is to feel it–there has to be pain to have the gain. Then you see social media and ‘this guy is doing this’ and ‘that guy is doing that’ and you veer off of your plan because you want to keep up. You miss important windows of rest and Recovery. Once I started to overdo it with my training, that’s when injuries started happening.”
“Now more than ever, I realize the WHOOP results really will directly correlate to your performance,” Sam added. “During the Open, I was trying to prime it up and wait for that day that I woke up will full-green status–where my sleep was 100% and my Recovery was in the 90s. That’s when I knew today was the day [to do the workout]. The best WHOOP scores and results I’ve ever had we’re in the Open, and the best performances I’ve had to date were in the Open.”
Sam told us he that has many positive takeaways from his experience this season, and hopes use the knowledge he’s gained going forward.
“Every year, with every workout, with every injury, with every good performance, you come out of that with a little more wisdom,” he said. “It’s just a shame that it takes so many mistakes to learn your lesson. I’m finally getting better at learning what that recipe really looks like in competition. You don’t have to beat the piss out of yourself to do well, and I hope this story can draw people’s attention to that.”",7/28/17

In the process, Sam made a name for himself by deadlifting 655 pounds.
The following season, Sam placed 10th in the individual competition at the 2015 Central Regional, missing the Games by just five spots. A year later, he made the top five and qualified as an individual for the 2016 Games.
Sam has the appearance of a Viking warrior, but on the inside he’s a puppy dog with a heart of gold. A quick conversation with Sam tells you so much more than you might expect from first glance at his gargantuan 210-pound physique.
He and his wife, Jennifer (who was also a member of the 2014 Conjugate team), own QTown CrossFit in Quincy, Illinois. They have a partnership with a local Special Olympics program to provide training for people with Down syndrome. One of these athletes has become Sam’s best friend, a young man named James Foster.
Sam says he wishes he could be more like James and love everybody, but it’s hard to believe that’s not already a staple of Sam’s character. He speaks with great passion and emotion about the things he cares about, in particular Jennifer. The two of them spend most of their days together–at work, at home, and even working out.
A clip from the Road to the Games series illustrates Sam’s morning warm-up routine, in which he “hits every isolated muscle group in his body.” It also includes commentary from Jennifer that provides a bit of insight into their life and relationship.

In 2009, a 24-year-old Stallings fell a single stroke shy of qualifying for the PGA Tour. “In the moment, you think it’s the worst thing that’s ever happened to you,” he said. “But knowing what I’ve gone through now, it was actually the best thing that could’ve happened to me at the time. I definitely wasn’t ready. When you go to the tour, you want to go there and stay there.”
Instead, Stallings played on the Nationwide Tour (now called the Web.com Tour), which he likened to Triple-A baseball. “It was a great experience for me,” he explained. “It helped me learn how to travel. I missed my PGA Tour card by a shot and two months later I’m flying to Australia and New Zealand to play in these Web.com tournaments. I was like, ‘Holy cow, I’m not ready for this either.’ The only way to get good at it is to do it. You have to learn your tendencies and what’s optimal for you.”
Stalling’s landed on the PGA Tour the following season",9/27/17
scott-stallings-career-pga-tour-whoop,"Scott Stallings Talks WHOOP, his Career and Life on the PGA Tour","Originally from Worcester, Massachusetts, Scott Stallings’ first love was baseball. When told that WHOOP headquarters is across the street from Boston’s iconic Fenway Park, Stallings said, “You know, if I could play for the Red Sox one game a month, not even the whole game, just a few innings, I’d do it and quit golf altogether.”
As a child, Stallings played many sports, but baseball was what he was best at. He still remembers the exact day when he decided to give it up and focus on golf:
“It was the last week of March in 1997, the day before my 12th birthday. I was on a competitive team that played 60 games a year, an enormous time commitment. We were getting ready to start back up for spring practice when I made my first hole in one on the golf course. Two weeks later, Tiger Woods won the Masters by 12 strokes. I decided ‘I want to do that.” The very next day I quit baseball. I called my coach and said ‘Hey, I’m going to go play golf, I want to do what Tiger does.’ They all thought I was nuts. Looking back on it, I probably was. I don’t know what I was thinking. But I fell in love with golf and wanted to do it for a living. I decided to chase it as a career and I’ve been very fortunate to be able to do it for a long time now.”",9/27/17
scott-stallings-career-pga-tour-whoop,"Scott Stallings Talks WHOOP, his Career and Life on the PGA Tour","“Well you’re not going to die, but you’ve got some problems that need to be fixed.”
There was a time not that long ago when Stallings thought his career might be over. “I had some pretty significant health stuff a few years back,” he said. “Major adrenal failure, I was a mess. I felt like I was doing all the right things, but I couldn’t figure out what was going on. I was gaining weight, sleeping all the time–I would wake up and literally not remember a single thing I did the day before. It sucked.”
After numerous doctors and a constant struggle searching for answers, Stallings finally caught a break:
“I found this doctor at UCLA and spent eight straight hours with him, he told me we were going to figure it out by the end of the day. Afterwards he said ‘Well you’re not going to die, but you’ve got some problems that need to be fixed.’ He called it a bunch of compounding negatives, something significant in my diet for the last 18-24 months. We found out that I was allergic to milk, sweet potatoes and barley. Amazingly, a protein shake I was drinking had all three. It was basically killing me and I drank it every day for two years. When my body was totally depleted from working out, what I was putting in it afterwards turned out to be the worst possible thing. It was crushing me.”
Stallings says he and his wife laugh about it now, but at the time he was so wiped out that he regularly spent as much time in bed as their young son. “I’d sleep all night, wake up, take a nap, take another nap, have dinner and go to bed. It was awful, I wouldn’t wish that on anybody. I also found out that I had an obstructive sleep apnea from breaking my nose as a kid. I had surgery that basically rotorootered my sinuses. Before the surgery, I’d had two sleep studies done and had less than 15 minutes of total REM sleep over two nights. I never even got to deep sleep.”",9/27/17
scott-stallings-career-pga-tour-whoop,"Scott Stallings Talks WHOOP, his Career and Life on the PGA Tour","Training Philosophy
“Get after it,” was Scott’s simple response when the topic of strength training came up. “I do it all. If I’m going to ask my body week in and week out to do a bunch of repetitive motion, I need to build a strong foundation to be able to push myself. My job has given me the chance to meet a lot of different people in golf, fitness and training. I’ve picked up pieces from everywhere. I would definitely say my training style does not fit your prototypical golfer.”
“I’m way more geared towards high-intensity stuff, I’m not scared to lift a barbell or move around weight. I went to college with Rich Froning, he’s been a big influence on me, as well as a bunch of other guys in the CrossFit community.”
Stallings’ trainer, Adam Kerley, chimed in on how they use WHOOP to guide Scott’s workout regimen: “It gives us actionable and objective information that enhances our ability to make wise decisions, particularly when it comes to the amount of Strain Scott takes on. We’re constantly striving to improve. The daily feedback from WHOOP deepens our accountability checks and helps optimize the direction of our training.”",9/27/17
scott-stallings-career-pga-tour-whoop,"Scott Stallings Talks WHOOP, his Career and Life on the PGA Tour","2018 and Beyond
With his 2017 tournament schedule now in the books, Stallings is looking ahead to next year. The first event of the PGA Tour’s 2018 season kicks off October 5 in Napa, California. During his brief “offseason,” Scott is doing an outstanding job maintaining consistent levels of Strain and Recovery:
“It’s all a huge part of my fitness journey,” he elaborated. “By no means do I feel I have it all figured out, but I’m a hell of a lot closer now than I was. So many people take their health for granted. You only get one body, you can’t trade it in. The better we steward it and take care of it and educate ourselves on how to improve, the better we’ll be at everything we do.”
For Scott, WHOOP has become a key piece of the puzzle.",9/27/17
scott-stallings-career-pga-tour-whoop,"Scott Stallings Talks WHOOP, his Career and Life on the PGA Tour","Home vs. Road
“WHOOP has helped me a ton with training in regards to travel, especially in terms of how quickly I can bounce back,” Stallings told us. “I’m blown away by the trend analysis, I can tell the difference from when I’m home or on the road. I actually don’t do the things to recover as well when I’m at home. [Editor’s note: We heard the same thing from a commercial airline pilot]. For example, on the road I’ll have a shake or something to eat immediately after training. But at home, other things get in the way–my two kids, the house, etc. My diet and recovery are not always the top priority at home. I also approach my training differently when I’m traveling because I know I have to be ready for Sunday. I’ll start ‘greening it out’ everyday prior to tournaments.”

scott-stallings-career-pga-tour-whoop,"Scott Stallings Talks WHOOP, his Career and Life on the PGA Tour","Getting on WHOOP
The travel, he says, is the most difficult aspect of being a pro golfer. It was also Scott’s impetus for using WHOOP:
“I’m on the road 250 days a year, crossing time zones every week. At one point this summer I had a seven-week stretch where I was travelling for 51 days straight. That was when I knew I needed to do something. In particular, I needed to figure out what I’m doing when I’m sleeping. I want to train at a high level, I want to perform at a high level, but there’s a missing link here. Some days I feel like I could run through a wall, and some days I feel like the wall is going to run me over. That’s when I decided to try WHOOP.” At 32 years old, Stallings wasn’t in danger of losing his tour card, but he felt his career was stagnating. “I got my Strap on the Monday before the John Deere Classic,” he said. “I wore it the whole week, training every day in 90-degree heat. Then I finished 5th. The next week, in Alabama [at the Barbasol Championship], it was 100 degrees every day. I trained daily, slept great, and finished 3rd. Right from the start, I realized WHOOP is an unbelievable tool to evaluate your process to be ready to go each day.”

In February of 2015, Stallings was suspended from the PGA Tour for three months for using a banned substance. He’d been taking small doses of an over-the-counter hormone recommended by a doctor to combat his extreme fatigue. The Tour only found out because Scott brought it to their attention:
“Anyone that knows me, especially in that instance, knows that there was never any ill-intent. I never failed any tests or anything, I actually went to the tour myself because I was trying to understand. I told them ‘I see this is on the banned list, but it’s what my doctor told me to take and I bought it at a grocery store. I’ve passed tests twice while taking it, what’s the deal?’ Then I found out that in order to actually fail with what I’d taken I needed to ingest 2,500 mg a day for three months. I only took 25 mg for 30 days. It never would’ve shown up anywhere.”
Does Stallings regret coming forward in the first place?
“Obviously I wish I hadn’t gone through all that publicly,” he said. “As a professional athlete, you kind of circumvent your right to being a normal human being. No one wants their health stuff out there, but it brought to light that the policy has holes that need to be fixed. If the same thing never happens to anyone else because of this, than that’s great. And at the end of the day, three months off was probably a good thing for me. So many guys have also reached out to me to say “What should I do? Help me not have what happened to you happen to me.” I’ve built lots of relationships from it and hopefully it will pave the way to get more people educated.”",9/27/17

self-experimentation-joe-holder,"The Art of Self-Experimentation, as told by Joe Holder","3. Improving Digestion: On top of numerous other factors that affect his heart rate variability (HRV), Joe has noticed that eating right before bed causes his HRV to drop. Additionally, if he’s not digesting food properly during the day (digestion can be affected by traveling often, food intolerances, food quality, and more), he’ll see a decrease. Joe starts each morning with a self-made juice recipe to help his digestion, follows a vegetarian diet, and rarely drinks alcohol or caffeine.
4. Infrared Sauna: Joe has experimented with lots of cold and heat therapies, but lately he gravitates towards heat to improve circulation, relax muscles, and reduce soreness. Unlike traditional saunas, infrared saunas heat the body through electromagnetic radiation to warm your body directly, rather than the air around you.
5. Plant-Based Diet: Joe follows a vegetarian diet, which has dramatically improved his food digestion and absorption. It regularly includes foods like sweet potatoes, quinoa, spaghetti squash, chickpeas, leafy greens, seasonal fruit, pea protein, and nuts. For Joe, being vegetarian is a personal choice, grounded in what he calls “forced asceticism”–the belief that being mindful about what he eats will trickle into his other choices. He explains that you can still be plant-based by eating a minimally processed plant-based lifestyle from clean meat and fish sources. He’s dubbed this lifestyle the #plantbasedgang, which has amassed a loyal following and even a sweatshirt line.
6. Giving Back: The Ocho System is the foundation for everything Joe does. A play on the infinity symbol, the philosophy of “One can help others, others can help one” is a constant reminder to keep moving himself forward so he can help others realize their potential. The Ocho System is a symbol of gratitude, and a farewell to his former nihilism.",2/22/19
self-experimentation-joe-holder,"The Art of Self-Experimentation, as told by Joe Holder","SELF-EXPERIMENTATION LEADS TO SELF-ACTUALIZATION
One of the first things you’ll notice about Joe when you meet him is his monk-like demeanor. He’s almost always wearing a hood, always has a book on hand, and speaks deliberately without wasting energy. In short, he’s a different person than he was 10 years ago, thanks to a constant dose of self-experimentation.
What works for Joe might not work for everyone, which is why trial and error are critical to unlocking your best self, and ultimately your best performance. Joe’s main motivator is simple–not living in pain, whether that’s emotional pain or physical pain. So for him, it’s about getting back to a state of balance so he can help himself, and help others.
“The saying that everybody has the same 24 hours isn’t really the case. We all have different lives, we all have different issues we deal with. If I’m in the green, then those 24 hours are much different than if I’m in the red and trying to take on the day.”
Self-experimentation has led to several tried and true methods that Joe swears by:
1. Honesty over Positivity: This might seem counterintuitive, but Joe believes being honest with yourself is better than forcing positivity. It wasn’t until Joe acknowledged the negative aspects of his life that he was able to make the commitment to change.
2. Meditation & Mindfulness: Finding a sense of peace throughout the day is incredibly important to Joe, especially in the morning. He believes humans are too distracted, and this is why some individuals do not make progress or change behaviors. “I call it popcorn brain, there’s so much stimuli popping at such a fast rate. We’re looking here, working there and nothing is sinking. Too many things get stuck in our working memory, instead of being assimilated to our base level programming. As result we don’t ever change or evolve as humans.”",2/22/19

It took weeks, months, and years to start listening to his body and perfect a treatment that kept him healthy and functioning. When he bounced back from his ankle injury, he was hit with another devastating blow. This time, he had broken his leg. All of the hard work had seemingly amounted to nothing, but Joe had one of two options–sit back and sulk, or re-apply the lessons learned from his previous injury to spur on his recovery. Although doctors estimated he’d miss the remainder of the season, he came back in 4 weeks.
Eventually, he graduated from UPenn with a better outlook and a stark realization; in order to be happy he wasn’t going to work for anybody anymore. He was going to continue working on himself and bring his health and performance mindset to the real world.",2/22/19

Soon, he’ll take the subway to 5th Ave where he’ll bounce around to train his clients, many of them high profile.
“You have to humble yourself before the great unknown.”
A former University of Pennsylvania wide receiver, Joe was accustomed to high expectations in both his academics and athleticism. The Ivy League program involved a lot of stressors–waking up early for practice, professors who didn’t take him seriously, tough coaches, and trying to maintain a social life. Joe was a walk-on who eventually became a starter, and the chip on his shoulder showed.
“I was like, I’m going to prove everybody wrong. I’m just going to do what it is that I know I can do. Be methodical. Be deliberate. Make them regret not taking that chance on me.”
Back then, you could say he was a nihilist throughout college. Competitive and driven, but disillusioned by a lack of purpose. He’d always been an anxious kid, but things started spiraling as he tried to navigate the pressures of school and sport. It hit home one night when he was coming back from a party and he forgot to call his dad to wish him a happy birthday. On top of that, he was battling multiple injuries and couldn’t play football. The reality set in and crushed him. So he decided to hit the reset button.
“Something’s Gotta Give.”
Joe’s nickname back then was “The Ferrari.” He was a super high-performer, but he was always in the shop. During college, he broke his ankle and consequently missed an entire season. His body had trouble healing, which he later discovered was much more than a physical limitation–it was driven by his mental state. “I was in such a dark and negative place.

To quickly touch on COVID and my last competition season, it was extremely difficult. We were on the road and away from home for more than 6 months. This year (and most years) all of the ski races were held in Europe. For Americans with no home base, we lived like gypsies, from one hotel to the next. It proved to be a very challenging and stressful winter. Nutrition, sleep, recovery–you name it, we struggled with it. It felt like COVID was closing in all around us most of the year.
Traveling and other stresses during the pandemic negatively impacted Mikes’ daily Recovery.
I am now happily vaccinated and seeing some light at the end of the tunnel. I was fully vaccinated for my last trip and it already felt slightly more normal. While I don’t believe we are completely out of the woods and I’m sure we will still see control measures in place next year, we are definitely moving in the right direction.
A return home, better sleep, and a growing sense of normalcy helped mike get back in the green.
I look forward to sharing my adventures from now through the season ahead. It will be a very interesting preparation with many foreign travel restrictions still in place this summer.

ski-coach-mike-day-olympics-preparation,US Ski Coach Mike Day Talks Training with WHOOP,"Hello WHOOP community. My name is Mike Day, I am an alpine coach with the United States Ski Team.
I am currently back home after recently completing camps in Mammoth Mountain, CA and Copper Mountain, CO for our first on-snow preparation period for next winter’s competition season. I have been coaching for 25 years at various levels and ages throughout the country. I was born and raised in Maine, which is also where I began my coaching career at Carrabassett Valley Academy at Sugarloaf, ME. From there I moved on to the Park City Ski Team in Utah before later joining the US Ski Team for the first time.
I coached in Salt Lake City in 2002, then moved on to a stint with Fischer Ski Company before rejoining the US team. After that, I took a break and worked at Green Mountain Valley School in Waitsfield, VT for a few years. I departed there in 2015 and am now going into my sixth season with the National Team. I never thought I would be back on the World Cup Tour, but here I am.
## How Does WHOOP Help Make Me a Better Ski Coach?
As you can see from my experience, I am now officially old… I turned 50 this year, so at this point in my life optimizing my sleep and recovery is of extra importance to keep up with the rigors of the job.
I want to talk a little bit about how I use my WHOOP and what I see as my most beneficial data. I think I can speak to many in the community about how motivating this device can be, the data does not lie. My fitness levels have consistently been a struggle for me throughout the years, and now I feel like I have a much clearer understanding and path forward with my WHOOP.
I travel around 220 days per year and work in a high-stress job–I am responsible for the programming of one of the most dominant athletes in the history of ski racing. The daily expectations are incredibly challenging (not to mention the difficulties brought forth by the global pandemic), and we continue to produce positive results.",6/28/21
ski-coach-mike-day-olympics-preparation,US Ski Coach Mike Day Talks Training with WHOOP,"Sleep, Recovery and HRV
The data that seems to drive my work performance the most is coming from sleep, recovery, and heart rate variability (HRV). We work in a very harsh environment and have demanding hours. I need quality sleep. We do not take many days off during the competition season, so my recovery numbers are important to keep me going day after day.
HRV has also been extremely telling for me. In the heat of the competition season, away from home for months on end, my HRV was a bit scary. It was consistently in the teens, now that I am back home (or at least in the USA), I am seeing significantly better numbers in the 30-55 range.
Mike’s HRV improved dramatically following the conclusion of a long competition season on The Road.
This tells me a lot and helps me to formulate management strategies moving forward.
I am also happily married 20 years, and have two kids, a 12-year-old-girl and a 14-year-old-boy. I believe the same data that helps me perform at a higher level at work also helps me perform at a higher level at home. These metrics are usable for all parents on a daily basis.",6/28/21

5. Supplements That Can Support Good Sleep
Melatonin is a hormone naturally produced by your body that aids in regulating your circadian rhythm. Your brain generally releases more of it when it gets dark in an effort to tell your body that it’s time to go to sleep.
Many people take supplements of melatonin to assist the process of falling asleep and prevent insomnia (combatting jet lag and shift work sleep disorder are common examples). As noted on our podcast by VP of Data Science and Research Emily Capodilupo, while melatonin can help you get to sleep initially, it won’t help you stay asleep.
Another sleep supplement that is widely gaining popularity is CBD oil. Anecdotally, many WHOOP members have reported seeing improved sleep stats after logging CBD in the WHOOP Journal. The journal feature allows you to track how any number of behaviors may affect your sleep and other metrics, with Monthly Performance Assessments that offer a detailed breakdown of your results.

Get comfortable – You want a mattress, pillow and sheets that you really like. You’ll fall asleep faster with warm feet as well, so wear socks to bed.
Total darkness – Either wear a sleep mask, or eliminate all the light in your room with blackout curtains and by covering any LEDs. Part of this is getting rid of your clock, for the light it emits and also because stress from watching it will keep you awake.
Cool temperature – Ideally 68 degrees or less, so you can experience that cozy feeling of getting into bed and cuddling under a warm blanket. Being hot and sweaty is also terrible for sleep.
No noise – Ear plugs do the trick. And if eliminating all noise isn’t a viable option, try a soft white-noise sound machine.

4. Maintain Your Circadian Rhythm with Sleep Consistency
Your circadian rhythm is a 24-hour internal clock which regulates various cycles your body goes through, most significantly when you fall asleep and wake up. You can help keep your circadian rhythm aligned and allow your body to function more smoothly by going to sleep and getting up at similar times each day–we refer to this as sleep consistency.
A data study of 25,000 WHOOP members found that better sleep consistency increased time spent in both REM and deep sleep (the restorative stages of sleep), and also improved overall sleep efficiency (the percentage of time in bed you’re actually asleep).
The WHOOP app tracks your sleep consistency on a nightly basis, and also provides you with in-depth analysis of it as part of your Weekly Performance Assessment:
Our Sleep Planner feature incorporates your natural circadian rhythm and sleep consistency metrics to suggest ideal times for you to go to bed and wake up each day.

### 1. Good Sleep Starts with Your Daytime Behaviors
1. Good Sleep Starts with Your Daytime Behaviors
In order to sleep well at night, it’s important to make smart choices during the day:
Be active – Studies show that exercise and other physical exertion may enable you to feel more tired when your body is ready to sleep.
Drink water – When WHOOP members report hydrating properly (throughout the day, not before bed specifically which can make you wake up to use the bathroom), they tend to sleep longer.
Avoid afternoon caffeine – Many people realize that an after-dinner coffee will keep them up at night, but the sleep-inhibiting effects of caffeine can actually linger in your system for 4 hours or more.
Don’t eat close to bed time – Your body wants to be in as restful a state as possible when its sleeping, and digesting food is a very active process.

2. Lock in Your Pre-Bed Routine
The human body generally functions better when it is able to stick to routines. Following a consistent bedtime ritual creates a distinct moment of separation between day and night and lets your body anticipate the onset of sleep.
Beyond the standard things like brushing your teeth and putting on pajamas, here are several sleep-promoting activities to think about including in your bedtime routine:
Yoga or stretching
Meditation or mindful breathing
Listen to relaxing music
Hot bath or shower (facilitates your body temperature dropping, part of falling asleep)
Blue light blocking glasses up to 3 hours before going to sleep
Reading or journaling (the old-fashioned way)

sleep-coach-menstrual-cycle,Sleep Coach Update: Incorporating Menstrual Cycle Phase for Increased Accuracy,"Menstrual Cycle and Sleep
Although the menstrual cycle is mostly about reproduction, its effects span all our systems including our circadian rhythm (biological clock best known for its role in regulating sleep and wake timing) and sleep architecture (fancy term for the distribution of sleep stages during a sleep). The premenstrual week – the end of the luteal phase right before menstruation begins – is known to be associated with relatively lower quality sleep and more time spent awake than during the rest of the cycle.
Because sleep efficiency will vary by menstrual cycle phase, people who menstruate can plan to allow for more time in bed during the late luteal phase to offset the reduced efficiency. For example, if you typically get 7.5 hours of sleep in an 8-hour sleep opportunity, you may want to give yourself an 8.25 hour opportunity to get that same 7.5 hours of sleep you need to feel your best.
The exact amount of reduced sleep efficiency will vary from person to person depending on how sensitive you are to these hormonal changes, so we’ve updated the WHOOP Sleep Planner to learn your individualized response to each menstrual cycle phase and to incorporate this into a more personalized recommendation.
To take advantage of this new feature, you’ll need to track your menstrual cycle using the WHOOP Journal. You can also now log each of the following in the journal: Nursing an infant, hot flashes during sleep, menstrual cramps, bloating and ovulating.",3/31/21
sleep-coach-menstrual-cycle,Sleep Coach Update: Incorporating Menstrual Cycle Phase for Increased Accuracy,"Effect of Hormonal Birth Control
Many people who menstruate choose to alter these hormonal cycles using hormonal birth control (HBC). People choose to use HBC to avoid pregnancy or just to avoid the unwanted symptoms the cycling hormones can have, such as painful cramps and acne breakouts.
Not all birth control is hormonal. Other options prevent pregnancy by creating a physical barrier between the sperm and egg (like a condom), or by killing the egg (like a copper IUD) or sperm (like a spermicide) so they can’t successfully meet and fertilize.
HBCs come in many forms, from the popular pills, to vaginal rings, implants, injections, and IUDs. These birth control forms are all just different delivery devices of the two primary hormones mentioned above, progesterone and estrogen. These hormones are either delivered together or just progesterone is used. Either way, they work by preventing ovulation (egg release), meaning that even if sperm show up, there is nothing to fertilize.
Here’s the thing though–if you are on HBC, even if you get a period the hormones in your birth control are dominating over your natural cycle. So while pre-HBC you might have had a cycle that looks like this the graphic pictured above, you now have a cycle that looks like this:
The now evened-out hormones prevent the symptoms related to fluctuations, but also mean that what we’re about to dig into in the remainder of this article will not apply to you because you don’t have hormonally distinct follicular and luteal phases.",3/31/21

sleep-coach-menstrual-cycle,Sleep Coach Update: Incorporating Menstrual Cycle Phase for Increased Accuracy,"Menstrual Cycle Phases
At a high level, the menstrual cycle can be broken down into two phases. The first phase is called the follicular phase, which starts on the first day of menstruation (bleeding) and ends 11-27 days later with ovulation (releasing an egg).
The luteal phase completes the cycle, running from ovulation to just before menstruation begins. These cycles continue one after the other as long as they aren’t interrupted by pregnancy, menopause, or health issues, but we’re not going to talk about those things here.
Those of us who menstruate are born with all the eggs we will ever produce already made, but in a half-baked state. The follicular phase is defined by the release of hormones that tell our ovaries (the egg storage organs) to produce sacs called follicles containing those immature eggs. Although we get a few follicles each menstrual cycle, typically around 20, only one (or occasionally more, as in the case of twins or higher-order multiples) will win out and turn into a mature egg released to the uterus in search of sperm.
While this is happening with our eggs, our uterus is simultaneously preparing for the egg’s arrival by thickening its lining and enriching it with life-sustaining nutrients. You can think of the uterus as the perpetual optimist, preparing for each egg’s arrival as if it will be fertilized and hang around for 40 weeks transforming into a full-on human.
Increases in Progesterone and Estrogen
The release of the egg into the uterus is called ovulation. This event marks the end of the follicular phase and the start of the 11-17 day luteal phase. Ovulation is also the time in the cycle when you can get pregnant. In hopes of a fertilized egg implanting, the luteal phase brings with it increases in two key hormones, progesterone and estrogen.",3/31/21
sleep-consistency-more-to-sleep-than-sleep-need,There's More to Sleep than Sleep Need: The Importance of Sleep Consistency,"Most people are familiar with the importance of getting about eight hours of sleep each night. However, most people are not familiar with the importance of getting those hours of sleep with at least somewhat consistent timing. WHOOP recently introduced Weekly Performance Assessments, and in them, a measure of how consistent your day-to-day timing of sleep is. Here we discuss some of the research that went into developing this feature and the details behind its calculation.
## What is Sleep Consistency?
Sleep consistency refers to the practice of maintaining a regular sleep schedule and routine, including going to bed and waking up at the same time each day. This means striving to achieve a consistent sleep pattern every day, even on weekends or days off.",7/16/18
sleep-consistency-more-to-sleep-than-sleep-need,There's More to Sleep than Sleep Need: The Importance of Sleep Consistency,"Our Inspiration
A 2017 paper out of Harvard University introduced a new metric called “Sleep Regularity.” The paper reported a significant positive correlation between this novel metric and academic performance (as measured by GPA) in healthy college students. In fact, students in the study with regular sleep and wake times had an average GPA of 3.72 while those students deemed irregular sleepers averaged only 3.24 on the 4-point scale; that’s the difference between an A and a B+ average.
The most exciting part of this finding, to quote the study’s lead, Dr. Andrew Phillips, was: “Sleep regularity was uncorrelated with sleep duration, suggesting that regularity captures another informative dimension of sleep.” To put this simply, if every night you get 100% of the sleep WHOOP recommends, you could still be missing out on potential sleep-related benefits if you are getting this sleep at inconsistent times.
Taking a moment to think logically, this isn’t that surprising. For example, we tend to feel better if we hydrate at somewhat regular intervals than we would if we were dehydrated all week but made up for it on the weekend with surplus hydration; why should sleep be any different? We therefore set out to quantify the relationship between sleep consistency and WHOOP data in order to understand why our members ought to be striving to improve the consistency of their sleep timing.
Before we dive into our exciting findings, let’s first back up one step and explain how we calculate sleep consistency.",7/16/18
sleep-consistency-more-to-sleep-than-sleep-need,There's More to Sleep than Sleep Need: The Importance of Sleep Consistency,"Why Is This Important?
According to researchers at both Harvard and Stanford, the reason why getting 8 hours of sleep each night is not the same as averaging 8 hours per night is that the brain gets “thrown off” – an effect equivalent to always being jet-lagged.
Disrupting the circadian rhythm in this way prevents us from producing the sleep hormone melatonin. Since melatonin concentrations are highly correlated with sleep quality, WHOOP set out to measure the relationship between various measures of sleep quality and our new measure of sleep consistency. The results are reviewed below.
### MORE SLEEP
As it turns out, WHOOP Members who think they are making up for insufficient sleep during the week with extra sleep on weekends are often fooling themselves. Those whose average sleep consistency was in the Poor zone averaged 4 percentage points lower Sleep Performance (the percentage of total sleep each night compared to sleep needed) than did users in the Sufficient and Maximal zones, corresponding to average Sleep Performance scores of 70.6 and 74.1, respectively. While that may not sound like a huge difference, it adds up to about 2.5 more hours of sleep over the course of a week.
### BETTER SLEEP
Members ask us all the time how to increase their slow wave (deep) sleep and REM sleep. While not the biggest game changer, those with greater sleep consistency averaged slightly more slow wave and REM sleep, and had slightly less time awake, than did members with the same amount of sleep time but lower measures of consistency. This means that consistent sleepers aren’t just getting more sleep, they are getting more restorative and efficient sleep than are people getting similar amounts of sleep at inconsistent times.",7/16/18
sleep-consistency-more-to-sleep-than-sleep-need,There's More to Sleep than Sleep Need: The Importance of Sleep Consistency,"Measuring Sleep Consistency
WHOOP Sleep Consistency measures the likelihood a user’s state (sleep, or wake) is the same at a particular clock time on each of four consecutive days. We note that this is a little different from the Harvard Sleep Regularity Index because their index was developed as a summary statistic, looking at months of data at a time, while the WHOOP metric looks at day-to-day changes in order to provide actionable daily feedback.
The example data below, taken from May 20th-27th, will help us better understand this metric.
This horizontal axis of this graph shows the 12-hour clock time in the user’s local timezone. Each row shows a different date, ordered consecutively from the 20th through the 27th of May, 2018. The green bars show when the user was asleep and the remaining white spaces indicate wake.
Notice that on the weekend days, May 20th, 26th, and 27th (indicated with a slightly darker green) the user did what so many of us do, and slept in far longer than he had been during the week. While sleeping in is great for catching up on sleep debt, it can be disruptive to our circadian rhythms (biological clocks). According to Phillips, the disruption to circadian rhythms is the most likely culprit behind the impaired academic performance observed in his study.
So even though this user was averaging about 8 hours in bed per night, he would have been better off getting a consistent 8 hours every night than what he did – 7 hours Monday-Friday and as much as 12 hours per night on the weekend. In this case, his data translates to an overall mediocre sleep analysis in his Performance Assessment, reproduced below.",7/16/18

Lastly, our members feel the difference. Those whose average sleep consistencies were in the Sufficient and Maximal zones were 4% more likely than those in the Poor zones to report feeling rested or energized on our daily Recovery survey. Members whose average sleep consistency was Poor were also more than twice as likely to report feeling exhausted than those whose average sleep consistencies were in the Sufficient and Moderate zones.

sleep-consistency-more-to-sleep-than-sleep-need-2,How to Monitor Your Sleep for your Training Regimen,"This seems to be the running trend with professional athletes. They want to peak. They want to make sure that when it’s time to perform they’re ready to at the highest level. Many times that’s hard for an athlete to do. Measuring “on the court” Strain is one thing; however, measuring “off the court” strain is another. This is a common dilemma athlete’s face prior to using WHOOP.
“I’ve always wondered what I’m doing to my body if I log the two hours I spend in the gym, the hour I spend fixing the lips to the jumps, the two hours I spend cutting down trees on my property, and the hour evening ride I do at the end of the day. There are many times I do all that a few days prior to a race. I show up feeling lazy and un-energized.
Just like any professional athlete Neko is consistently training for optimal performance. When he’s racing 7 times a week in April through September, he needs to be consistently ready to perform. Balancing the proper amount of strain with the right amount recovery is the key Neko and many other elite mountain bikers are looking for. He can’t just peak for one race and call it quits, he needs to maintain his fitness over the course of the summer with enough time to recover from race to race.
“People don’t really understand how much fitness plays into the sport of mountain biking. It’s such a technical sport that the nuances get lost. I guess you can say the same about baseball. However, if I tried to put it into perspective, downhill biking is like sprinting for as hard as you can for five minutes – while handling a bike going 40–50 MPH. It adds up.”
On the World Cup Tour, Neko annually races 7 races in 7 different countries. The demand on his body to prepare for competition with excessive travel can take a toll on an athlete’s body. Neko now uses WHOOP to optimize his training regimen. With WHOOP’s data, he’s now able to quantify his strain to always make sure he’s recovering well.",7/28/16

“We’re not out there creating enemies, which I felt was par for the course with BMX racing. Competing against a group, instead of one-on-one, was a breath of fresh air and something I wasn’t used to. I found the atmosphere at mountain bike races more friendly. I knew this sport was for me.”
In 2006, Neko made the transition over to Mountain Biking, and three years later in 2009, he signed his first pro contract.
“When I first started racing World Cups, which is the highest level of racing, there were things on the course that I could do to save time. I could take different lines down the hill, or float over rolls versus getting air between them. After a few years under my belt, I’m getting to the point where I’m not fazed by course difficulty. It’s a nice feeling”
Now that his body is his livelihood, Neko’s training has taken a turn for the better. “It’s the training in the gym, outside the gym, on the bike, and off the bike that makes an athlete great. You can never come home and say ‘I’m done; I can stop working because I’m off the clock.’ Every minute of your life is adding up to how well you perform when the time matters.” Neko goes on to explain that even with all this constant physical and mental training, knowing when to dial it back, and when to turn it up, is something he’s missed from his training regimen.
“I’m a numbers guy — always have been. When I’m training, I want to see quantifiable results so that I know my hard work is adding up,” he explains. Seeing this information can give athletes the confidence to look back at their training and know how accurately they are preparing for their big event.”",7/28/16

– Neko Mulally, Elite Downhill Mountain Biker
“People ask me how I got into mountain biking. The clean and simple answer is through BMX,” Neko says. “Growing up, there was a local track that held races during the weekdays and double-header races on the weekend. Open to the public, this track fueled the start of my career. It started with me begging my mom to let me race every day – this was a commonplace in the Mulally household, and I loved it. Biking soon became my lifeblood and my existence. It became my life.”
Neko’s weeks were engrossed with daily trips to the track with one goal in mind – to fine-tune his biking skills.
“When frequently riding BMX, you start to develop a skill-set worth talking about. I probably raced 100 times a summer as a kid, and the more I raced the more comfortable I became on my bike. Terrain that was originally difficult started to get progressively easier, and before I knew it, it was like second nature to me. I couldn’t yet race with my eyes closed, but that was the ultimate goal.” Neko winked.
The gradual confidence Neko built by racing BMX fit perfectly in line with that his Dad stood for. Neko’s dad was a mountain biker himself and had a goal that when his sons got good enough at BMX they’d transition over to mountain bikes. “Hey boys, let’s try a mountain bike race this weekend and see what it’s like,” he said. So on a calm summer morning, as the earth lay cool and still, Neko and his brother fell in love with this new sport.",7/28/16

## What is Sleep Deprivation?
In Somnology (the study of sleep), sleep deprivation is divided into two types, chronic and acute. As the names suggest, chronic sleep deprivation is continually getting less sleep than you need, while acute sleep deprivation is getting less sleep than you need for a night or two and generally implies a quick return to a healthy sleep schedule. These two types of sleep deprivation have different consequences for health and well being. While this post is not exhaustive, I’ve broken down some of the effects of chronic and acute sleep deprivation and what you can do to get back on track.
## Effects of Chronic Sleep Deprivation
According to a 2013 gallup poll, 40% of American adults are chronically sleep deprived, getting less than 7 hours of sleep per night. While these stats suggest that it is “normal” to be sleep deprived, it certainly doesn’t come without consequences. Chronic sleep deprivation has been associated with:

Rising rates of chronic sleep deprivation in the US are often attributed to increased demands on our time. The good news, there are ways many of us can get more sleep without increasing the time dedicated to sleep, simply by making a few changes to our sleep routines and environments.
Last month, we released the results of a survey of the top 100 sleepers on WHOOP, as well as research on how improving Sleep Consistency can improve your Sleep Efficiency, leading to more sleep without extending your time in bed. That said, if you are dedicating less than 7 hours a night to sleep, no amount of bedtime routine changes are going to make that sufficient. If it’s not possible to get 7 hours of sleep in one go, consider finding time for a nap–even adding 30 minutes of sleep can make a big difference towards how good you feel and reducing your risk of adverse health events.
While it is practically impossible to never be sleep deprived, when you find yourself acutely sleep deprived, the best things you can do are make time to catch back up on sleep and know your limitations. Don’t get behind the wheel of a car or operate heavy machinery, and be aware that your hormones are out of whack and dietary cravings might be pushing you towards a snack or second helping your body doesn’t actually need.
From time to time we answer questions from our members regarding the various features and analysis WHOOP provides, how to better understand the data, and general tips and tricks for optimizing performance and making the most of your experience on WHOOP.

How does Brooke do it? What enables her to get such fantastic sleep on a regular basis? “I make sleep a huge priority,” she told us. “I am very strict and disciplined when it comes to going to bed.”
WHOOP also plays a key role in empowering Brooke to optimize the quantity and quality of her sleep. “I use WHOOP for various different reasons, but the top three are for sleep, heart rate and HRV. The first thing I look at on my sleep data [each morning] is just the total number of hours. I always aim for about nine. Then I will look at the amounts of deep sleep and REM.”

“I typically try to keep to my regular sleep schedule of going to bed and waking up at the same time,” said Brooke (this improves the effectiveness of your sleep and maintains your circadian rhythm). “However, if I have an early morning planned or am out with friends at night, I’ll go to the WHOOP Sleep Planner and it will tell me what time I need to be in bed in order to get my full recommended amount of sleep. It helps keep me accountable!”
### Learn What Impacts Your Sleep
“I try not to let my sleep affect what I do for training unless it was extremely poor, I just try to learn from it,” explained Brooke. “Did I eat before bed and maybe that caused me to not get as much deep sleep? Or maybe did I eat sugar or drink too much caffeine? I have used my WHOOP for over 5 years and have learned more and more through trial and error about what helps me sleep versus what doesn’t [by tracking behaviors in the Journal feature].

sleep-myths-debunked,12 Sleep Myths Debunked and One That May Be True,"Myth 5: You Can’t Catch Up on Sleep
Maybe true? Everyone has bad nights spent tossing and turning and staring at the clock. When you fail to get all the sleep your body needs you begin to accumulate sleep debt. Sleep debt is the amount of extra sleep you need because of insufficient sleep the night before.
Naps can help you catch up, but you won’t gain any benefits if your afternoon snooze prevents you from sleeping at night.
However, very short naps and napping for a full sleep cycle can enhance mental and physical performance, put you in a better mood and increase alertness. The “power nap,” an early afternoon nap between 10 and 20 minutes in length, allows you to enter light sleep but not a full sleep cycle. This can help you feel refreshed rather than groggy. The average length of a full sleep cycle is about 90 minutes. A 90-minute nap allows you to spend time in each sleep stage (light, deep and REM) and can help you feel rested and rejuvenated.
## Myth 6: Watching TV or Using Your Phone are Good Ways to Relax Before Bed
Debunked: A bedtime routine can help you unwind from the day and trigger natural sleep hormones to tell your brain and body it is time for rest. However, your bedtime routine should not include watching TV or looking at your phone. Blue light from electronics directly affects human circadian rhythm. If you do watch TV or play with your phone at night, try wearing glasses that block blue light. Many phone models offer settings that alter the screen temperature to a warmer color filtering out blue light.
## Myth 7: Alcohol Before Bed Helps You Sleep
Debunked: Drinking alcohol may put you to sleep, but it does not provide good sleep.

sleep-myths-debunked,12 Sleep Myths Debunked and One That May Be True,"Myth 13: Reading in Bed Will Prevent You From Sleeping
WHOOP members see slight improvements in heart rate variability and recovery when they read before bed.
Debunked: A 2009 study showed that 6 minutes of reading a book reduced the subjects’ stress by 68% compared to other activities, including listening to music or taking a walk. Reading can distract your mind, allowing your muscles to relax and your breathing to slow. All of these things make you feel calmer and let you sleep.
Don’t stay up all night reading though, aim for 20-30 minutes max and put the book down if you start feeling sleepy before that. What you read doesn’t matter as long as it’s interesting to you. Additionally, see Myth 5 about avoiding screens. Reading from a screen has a different effect.
WHOOP members on average see a slight improvement in sleep data when reading before bed.
## Debunk Your Personal Sleep Myths With WHOOP
WHOOP automatically detects exactly when you fall asleep each night, as well as the amount of time you spend awake, in light sleep and in the restorative stages, REM and deep sleep. By logging in the app the time you go to bed, WHOOP will measure your sleep latency. The WHOOP Sleep Planner uses your circadian rhythm to make recommendations on ideal bed and wake times to help you get high-quality, efficient sleep.
Additionally, the WHOOP Journal lets you track variables like alcohol and caffeine, reading or using devices in bed, and more, allowing you to monitor your own sleep data and discover what helps you sleep and what doesn’t.

sleep-myths-debunked,12 Sleep Myths Debunked and One That May Be True,"Myth 8: Being Able to Fall Asleep Anytime is Healthy
Debunked: Being able to fall asleep at any time and anywhere is not a sign of being a good sleeper. It’s a sign of having sleep problems. While some people, including military personnel, have trained themselves to sleep at any time using specific techniques, dropping off to sleep at random times is different. It can be a sign of insomnia, circadian rhythm disorders, narcolepsy and even sleep apnea.
## Myth 9: Lying in Bed With Your Eyes Closed Is as Good as Sleeping
Debunked: We all experience the occasional sleepless night, but lying there trying to sleep is not the same as sleeping, and it doesn’t have the same benefits. Sleep is a state in which we experience sensory detachment from our surroundings. It’s when our brains process the previous day’s activities and the body is rested, repaired and prepared for the next day.
Rest, while it can be used to increase physical and mental well-being, does not involve the same levels of disengagement from surroundings as sleep.
If you often find yourself awake at 3 am, try some techniques to help you fall asleep fast.
## Myth 10: You Can Learn to Function Just as Well with Less Sleep
Debunked: You may be able to function on less nighttime sleep by taking a nap during the day, but that’s not the same as functioning on less sleep.
In one study published in the journal Sleep, participants who cut their sleep to 6 hours a night suffered the same decreases in cognitive function and reaction time as people who went two full nights without sleep. The study found they did not adapt to the new sleep schedules, and they were generally unaware of their poor performance.",7/23/21
sleep-myths-debunked,12 Sleep Myths Debunked and One That May Be True,"Myth 11: Snoring is Mostly Harmless
Debunked: Snoring has several causes, including anatomical, alcohol consumption, allergies, illness, and weight. Almost everyone snores occasionally, and it can be harmless to the snorer (although less so to anyone within hearing distance). But if the noise is accompanied by other symptoms, it may be time to see a sleep specialist.
Symptoms such as pauses in breathing, gasping or choking at night, excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating, and a sore throat or headache upon waking can be signs of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). People with OSA are at risk of high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke, and have an increased risk of motor vehicle accidents due to lack of sleep.
## Myth 12: Exercising at Night is Bad for Sleep
Debunked: Exercising at night has always been seen as bad for sleep, but a 2018 study suggests that evening workouts are fine, as long as you have a chance to wind down before bed.
Researchers found that not only did evening exercise not affect the quality of sleep, it also appeared to help people fall asleep faster and spend more time in deep sleep—with the caveat that those who did high-intensity training less than an hour before bedtime had longer sleep latency—the length of time it takes you to fall asleep—and had poorer sleep quality.

sleep-myths-debunked,12 Sleep Myths Debunked and One That May Be True,"Some ideas about sleep are so ingrained into our collective consciousness that we think they must be true. However, scientific studies about human sleep have shown that many of the things we believe about sleep are false. We’ve looked at some of the biggest myths around sleep and debunked most of them.
## Myth 1: Adults Need 8 Hours of Sleep Every Night
Debunked: Getting enough sleep is vital to cognition, performance and overall health. It allows the body to repair and restore itself in preparation for the day’s strain. Eight hours of sleep is the commonly accepted goal for adults, but 8 hours isn’t necessarily the correct amount of Zs for everyone. The National Sleep Foundation recommends that adults get between 7 and 9 hours of sleep per night.
WHOOP members average slightly more than 7 hours of sleep each night. Women average 7:20 while men get 7:03 hours of sleep. However, how much sleep WHOOP members get and how much they need are not the same thing. Your sleep needs can change daily, based on factors including how much sleep you got the night before and the amount of exercise and stress you accumulated throughout the day. WHOOP quantifies your daily strain to help you determine how much sleep you need on a particular night. Based on that and leftover sleep debt (more on this below) from previous nights, the average nightly sleep need for WHOOP members is 8:34.",7/23/21
sleep-myths-debunked,12 Sleep Myths Debunked and One That May Be True,"Myth 2: Time in Bed = Time Asleep
Debunked: Many people think that if they go to bed at 11 pm and wake up at 7 am they’re getting 8 hours of sleep. Unfortunately that’s not the case, and in reality if you’re in bed for 8 hours you’re probably getting a lot closer to 7 hours of sleep. Disturbances (minor body movements) and waking periods can amount to close to an hour of lost sleep each night. WHOOP tracks these occurrences as you sleep so you can see how much sleep you’re actually getting.
The WHOOP Sleep planner shows that time spent in bed is not the same as sleeping. This WHOOP member was awake for 48 minutes, and only got 7:13 hours of sleep despite spending 8:01 in bed.
## Myth 3: Waking Up In the Middle of the Night Isn’t Normal
Debunked: While sleeping uninterrupted is a goal, it’s normal for even the best sleepers to have disturbances and even be awake for short periods of time. Wakings can be exacerbated by noise, artificial light, a partner’s movements and other causes.
There is evidence that in some cultures our ancestors spent some of the late-night hours awake, having a first sleep and a second sleep with 1-2 hours between where they were awake and active. They still got enough sleep but did not generally try to sleep 7-9 hours straight like we do today.

## Myth 4: How Long You Sleep is All That Matters
Debunked: Duration is important, but it’s not everything. Sleep quality and sleep continuity are also vital to your overall health. Health issues such as sleep apnea and insomnia can cause disruptions in your sleep cycle. Even when you meet your sleep goals, you may still not feel refreshed the next day if your sleep cycles are interrupted.",7/23/21
sleep-regularity,"Don't Just Get Enough Sleep, Get the Right Sleep","While they caution that the results show a correlative and not a causative relationship, the study’s authors suggest that those students who worked with their circadian rhythms (biological clocks) by sleeping and waking at regular times slept deeper and more efficiently and therefore were able to better reach their academic potentials than were their classmates who worked against their circadian rhythms by sleeping and waking at inconsistent times. The change in GPA associated with SRI is even more interesting given that the high-SRI students didn’t actually average any more sleep than did their low-SRI classmates.
This second part is particularly interesting because college students’ schedules are so jam-packed, that the common advice “try to get more sleep” is, or at least feels, impossible to action. However, what this study showed was that you don’t necessarily have to get more sleep to get more sleep-related benefits; some schedule rearranging might be all it takes to unlock some of the unrealized potential of the amount of time you are already dedicating to sleep. That’s not to say that increasing your SRI can make up for inadequate sleep–you still need to get those Z’s, but it does remind us that not all sleep was created equally, and there are better and worse ways to arrange your sleep-wake schedule.
This is the part that was intriguing to the Analytics team at WHOOP–our athletes are constantly asking us how they can sleep better, recover faster, and reach peak performance, and while we have an arsenal of tips and tricks to share, there is a limit to the amount of additional time our athletes can dedicate to sleep each night while still meeting their athletic, academic, personal, and social commitments.",8/22/17
sleep-regularity,"Don't Just Get Enough Sleep, Get the Right Sleep","In 2016, we reported that over their first four months on WHOOP, a cohort of 119 college athletes increased their nightly commitment to sleep by an average of about 41 minutes. This data suggests that the average collegiate athlete has at least some capacity to increase their sleep time investment, but the month-over-month increase in sleep observed for these athletes’ first 4 months on WHOOP is expected to level off at some point as added sleep time starts to butt up against other priorities. For this post, we therefore went back and looked at sleep increases over time for collegiate athletes who have been on the system for about a year.
What we observed was that for thousands of sleeps from 121 collegiate athletes, average time dedicated to sleep increased somewhat steadily over the first 6 months before settling into a more stable norm. Note that these are not the same athletes that were analyzed in the initial study cited above, but a new cohort who joined the system shortly after our second-generation product, WHOOP Strap 2.0, was introduced.
This data suggests that our average collegiate athlete has likely maxed out on their ability to increase their time dedicated to sleep by around their 6th month on WHOOP. However, that doesn’t mean that their ability to benefit from the sleep aspects of our product is tapped out. The quality and restorativeness of our sleep is dictated by so much more than how much time we spend in bed.",8/22/17

The Benefits of Sleep Regularity
In college, if I rolled into the dining hall for breakfast on a weekend morning the scene was notably different than during the week. Gone were the crowded tables of excited students, and in its place were countless empty tables and only a smattering of students. What was going on in my dorm and in dorms across the country was the long awaited weekend sleep-in.
According to one survey by the National Sleep Foundation, about 60% of people are getting more sleep on weekends than on weekdays. Analysis of 310 current collegiate athletes who use WHOOP was conducted for this article, and confirmed the National Sleep Foundation’s finding by showing that 62% are getting more sleep on weekends than on weekdays. A recent study out of Harvard University examined this behavior pattern in students in order to find out if the regularity of sleep/wake timing impacted academic performance.
What they found is probably enough to motivate all those cozily sleeping students out of bed–using a new metric they created for the study, the “sleep regularity index (SRI),” they observed a 0.1 point increase in GPA (on the 4.0 scale) per 10% improvement in SRI. According to the study’s authors, SRI is “the probability of an individual being in the same state (asleep vs. awake) at any two time-points 24 hours apart.” These second-by-second probabilities are then scored such that a perfectly consistent schedule will earn a 100% and a completely random schedule will earn a 0.",8/22/17
sleep-running-and-the-myth-of-the-two-nights-before-rule,"Sleep, Running, and the Myth of the ‘Two Nights Before’ Rule","At the end of the cross country season, I compiled the season’s worth of WHOOP recovery data from myself and my teammates and noticed some exciting trends: As the myth suggested, sleep the night before a race didn’t strongly correlate with performance, but getting more sleep two nights before a race did statistically significantly correlate with performance. I noticed that an additional 30 minutes of sleep was correlated with about a 7-second improvement performance over an 8K race. The results made total sense to me: if you are nervous and don’t sleep well the night before a big race, but you do sleep well leading up to the race, you can power through the single night of sleep loss and still have a strong performance. However, if you also don’t sleep well two nights before, there is too much sleep debt to simply “power through,” and your body will not be sufficiently recovered to race well.",8/4/16
sleep-running-and-the-myth-of-the-two-nights-before-rule,"Sleep, Running, and the Myth of the ‘Two Nights Before’ Rule","For the past eight years, I’ve been obsessed with running. While competing in cross country and track and field for Harvard, I gradually trained harder each year in an effort to compete with the best in the NCAA. In high school, I ran an average of 40-50 miles per week, but as I progressed through my first three years of college, I began running 80-90 miles a week and started adding more stretching, weight training, and core work to my routines. Training became a long grind, especially while balancing schoolwork. The summer before my senior year, I increased my mileage to 95 miles a week to get ready for my last cross country season. Before going back to campus, I learned that my team was going to be among the first to use WHOOP.
I then had an idea: since WHOOP collects data on sleep and recovery, I wondered if there would be any noticeable trends between sleep and race performance. In distance running, everyone always says not to worry if you don’t sleep the night before a race; your sleep two nights before is the most important. While it’s logical to think this way, the importance of “sleep two nights before” has never actually been shown in scientific research to be anything more than a myth; so I reached out to WHOOP, and for the next 9 months we partnered on a research project to answer this question.",8/4/16
sleep-running-and-the-myth-of-the-two-nights-before-rule,"Sleep, Running, and the Myth of the ‘Two Nights Before’ Rule","The WHOOP Effect
From my experience as an athlete, I’ve always had an intuitive understanding of the basics of recovery. It’s pretty simple – getting enough sleep and rest is important so your body can absorb the training needed to compete at the highest level. This is especially essential in distance running since you have to come close to overtraining in order to get faster. The challenge all runners face is finding the right balance between training hard and letting their bodies recover enough to avoid injury and illness. The challenge involved in getting this balance right is what made me immediately interested when I first heard about WHOOP, as WHOOP quantifies how ready the body is to train hard.
Before using WHOOP, I would only spend 8 hours in bed every night. WHOOP helped me realize that 8 hours in bed doesn’t equal 8 hours of sleep. In order to get the 8-10 hours of sleep I needed, I had to spend more time in bed. During the cross country and track season of my senior year, I lengthened my sleep by going to bed earlier and getting up later. I also changed my habits to improve my quality of sleep. After I started using WHOOP, I noticed that I would fall asleep quicker and sleep better if I had less screen time before bed. I started to set aside time right before bed where I would read instead of using my computer for homework or go on my phone and noticed that my sleep quality improved. WHOOP was easy to use and kept me honest about how my behavior was impacting my sleep, and therefore my training and racing.
During my first three years of college running, I had several setbacks with injuries and had inconsistent race results. During my senior year, I was able to stay healthy, train more, and took 26 seconds off my 10K personal best. Getting more sleep definitely played a role in my improvement, and WHOOP helped me be more accountable about getting the sleep I needed.

sleep-weight-loss-metabolic-health,How Sleep Affects Weight Loss,"Sleep and Health on a Larger Scale
Through observations in WHOOP data, we can safely hypothesize that meeting sufficient sleep need and stabilizing sleep/wake times (maintaining your circadian rhythm) is one of the easiest ways to positively influence your health.
While any kind of health intervention must overcome barriers in order to achieve a meaningful impact, sleep offers a simple path to the internal synchronization necessary to optimize our mental, physical and emotional well-being.
### The value of sleep vs other forms of behavior change:
Sleep is a low-cost (only our time) health intervention that is accessible to everyone
It occurs during the portion of the day (at night) when competition for our time and attention is greatly reduced
An improvement to sleep is not changing behavior, at worst it is simply a modification to existing behavior (everybody sleeps!)
There is a rising wave of external research that also illustrates the critical contribution of sleep towards our greater health. As Dr. Matthew Walker, author of Why We Sleep and the Founder and Director of the Center for Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley, makes clear in no uncertain terms:
“A balanced diet and exercise are of vital importance, yes. But we now see sleep as the preeminent force in this health trinity. The physical and mental impairments caused by one night of bad sleep dwarf those caused by an equivalent absence of food or exercise. It is difficult to imagine any other state—natural or medically manipulated—that affords a more powerful redressing of physical and mental health at every level of analysis.”",9/11/20

Sufficient, consolidated, quality sleep is so significant that you could easily argue it’s the most influential factor in enabling metabolic health and achieving the body you desire. If you want to feel better about your body, the most common advice is to “eat less and move more.” This suggestion is an oversimplification and perhaps not the best way to think about addressing complexities associated with internal fitness or metabolic health.
## What is Metabolic Health?
As new scientific discoveries suggest, sleep may actually be the platform upon which other health improvements, like metabolic health and physical exercise, are made possible.

sleep-weight-loss-metabolic-health,How Sleep Affects Weight Loss,"How Does Sleep Affect Weight Loss?
These discoveries help us appreciate the fact that sleep plays a critical role in stabilizing all major functions of the body. It helps regulate the hormonal system, manages the autonomic nervous system (your body’s fight or flight response), and improves a variety of cognitive activities.
We are just now beginning to understand the massive influence sleep has in driving the behaviors (and the regulation of critical systems) in the body that ultimately support the metabolic health change necessary to achieve and maintain your desired goals related to body composition.
The message for people trying to lose weight is clear–sleep makes a big difference in the results of any dietary intervention you attempt to employ. Optimal metabolic health (relative to your potential) is not possible without sufficient, quality sleep.",9/11/20

A study performed at the University of Chicago revealed that cutting back on sleep substantially undermines efforts to lose fat through dieting. In fact, results showed it reduced fat loss by as much as 55%.
During weeks with adequate sleep, the subjects lost 3.1 pounds of fat and 3.3 pounds of fat-free body mass–nearly half of the weight they lost through dieting was fat. However, when they cut back on their sleep, only 20% of their weight loss came from fat. The participants also felt hungrier when they got less sleep. As outlined previously, restricted sleep will yield higher levels of ghrelin, a hormone that triggers hunger and reduces energy expenditure.
In another study, it was found that short sleep and sleep loss impaired metabolism and insulin resistance. The rate of clearing sugar out of the bloodstream was 40% slower than when participants were well-slept.
Additionally, Short sleepers secreted 50% more insulin than normal sleepers to reach similar glucose results, placing them at a risk for developing insulin resistance in the long-term. Insulin resistance impairs the body’s ability to burn fat for energy and is a primary contributor to weight gain.

Last year we surveyed the 100 best sleepers on WHOOP about the things they do to make the most of their time in bed. Our analytics team filtered through millions of hours of sleep data to find the WHOOP members with the best sleep efficiency (percentage of time in bed spent actually sleeping), sleep consistency (going to bed and waking up at consistent times each day), and overall sleep performances (amount of sleep each night vs. amount sleep needed).
We discovered that our top 100 sleepers averaged a nightly sleep performance of 96%. And while for many of us that may seem virtually impossible to achieve, our survey results showed that much of what these elite sleepers do isn’t that different from the norm.
For example, 66% of them drink some kind of caffeinated beverage in the morning nearly every day. The vast majority (74%) almost always go without caffeine in the afternoon as well.
Just like the rest of us, 70% of our top sleepers use an alarm clock to wake up either most or all of the time. And while some of our top sleepers do take supplements to help them out, including ZMA, CBD, Melatonin and herbal teas, 42% of them do it the old fashioned way and attain peak sleep without ever using supplements.
One thing they all seem to agree on, alcohol is detrimental to sleep. While we didn’t inquire about alcohol directly, we asked the survey takers to write in what they believe most harms their sleep–30% mentioned alcohol consumption.

Jeffrey Adler, a 27-year-old Canadian athlete who finished 5th overall at the Games in 2020, was kind enough to let us take a peek inside his data.
## Snow CrossFit: Stay Frosty & Jeffrey Adler’s Heart Rate Data
The first event at the Dubai CrossFit Championship, called “Stay Frosty,” took place inside the city’s 25-story indoor ski resort. It consisted of 500 meters on a ski erg, plus a 400-meter run up and down the snow-covered mountain.
Stay Frosty began just before 8 am local time on Thursday, December 16. Jeffrey Adler awoke that morning with a 78% recovery, which was quite impressive considering he’d gone a night without sleep only two days earlier while traveling from Montreal to Dubai (and jumping ahead 9 time zones).
Jeffrey Adler lost a night of sleep while traveling, but was back in the green For Day 1 of the Dubai CrossFit Championship.
Adler completed the first event in 15:37, good for 7th place. He logged a strain of 12.3 during the activity, with his heart rate peaking at 190 beats per minute just as he crossed the finish line.

Less than an hour later the athletes then competed in Event 1B, a 700-meter run up the ski slope (again in the snow) while wearing a 20-pound vest. Adler’s time of 3:33 was 5th-best overall, and his HR got as high as 195 bpm during the run.

The venue switched to the Dubai Tennis Stadium for Day 2, which proved to be Adler’s best of the weekend. A great night’s sleep (8:42, more than enough to meet his sleep need) led to a solid 64% recovery. Adler also got in a rejuvenating 31-minute nap that afternoon prior to the evening’s events.
In Lift-Off (2 clean and jerks of the athlete’s choice) Adler put up 165 and 155 kg, which landed him 3rd. He then followed that up with another 3rd-place finish in Event 3. In the day’s final event, which featured a bike erg, handstand walk, and overhead squats, Adler came in 4th.
His heart rate reached a max 189 bpm on Friday (slightly lower than the previous day in the snow), and his overall day strain was 17.7.
## Getting Back in the Green
By Day 3 the strain and intensity of the competition began to take its toll on Adler’s body, and his recovery dipped to 21%. His heart rate variability, which had been 111 ms on Thursday was down to 58, and his resting heart rate rose from 54 bpm to 62. However, Adler still managed to post top-5 performances in two of the remaining events that day to finish the Dubai Championship in 4th place.
The following day Adler’s recovery was once again 21%, but with some time to rest (only 5.9 total strain Sunday) he was back in the green (71%) the next morning.

3. Higher Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Lower Resting Heart Rate
Your heart rate variability and resting heart rate are great indicators of your overall fitness, and are two of the primary factors that determine your daily WHOOP recovery (readiness to perform).
Each morning, WHOOP members have the option to log alcohol consumption from the previous day in the Journal feature. When this question is answered “yes,” on average their resting heart rates tracked during sleep are 8 beats per minute higher (worse) than their baselines, while their HRV is 22 milliseconds lower (also worse). Check out the resting heart rate data (and the effects of alcohol on it) shared by one of our members below:
For example: the left is a week with no alcohol consumption, and the right is a week with a few ? on Friday. The spike is so noticeable! Note, these were intense weeks at school so my stress levels and caffeine consumption also contributed to elevated RHR levels overall. @whoop pic.twitter.com/fMIBuChgGQ

### 1. MUCH Better Sleep
1. MUCH Better Sleep
Many people mistakenly assume that because alcohol is a sedative, it actually helps them sleep. What they don’t realize, however, is that it completely destroys the quality of their sleep.
“Sleep is an incredibly active process,” states WHOOP Director of Analytics Emily Capodilupo in our recent podcast, Alcohol’s Effect on Sleep, Recovery and Performance. “Our bodies are working really, really hard when we sleep, and if you have alcohol in your system, none of those very active processes can happen.”
Shortly after falling asleep your body generally enters a period of slow wave sleep (SWS, also known as deep sleep), which is the physically restorative stage of sleep. After that, a normal cycle includes a period of REM sleep, the mentally restorative stage.
However, when your body is sedated and working to process alcohol in your system (increasing heart rate), you miss out on the benefits of these stages and just get a lot of light sleep instead. So even if you sleep for a long time after drinking, you don’t wake up feeling rested and recovered.
### 2. More Meaningful Workouts
2. More Meaningful Workouts
Another thing many people don’t realize is that they don’t get stronger and fitter while working out. Exercise itself actually causes micro tears in your muscles and breaks them down. Fitness gains happen afterwards, when your body repairs itself during sleep. In fact, 95% of human growth hormone is produced during slow-wave sleep. But as stated above, alcohol in your system prevents SWS from happening.
What does this mean? If you drink at night before going to bed, you’re basically rendering any workouts you did that day useless.",1/2/22

5. Easier to Lose Weight
It’s well documented that excessive alcohol consumption is a common risk factor for obesity. However, drinking even small amounts of alcohol can make it very difficult for you to lose weight. No matter what type of alcoholic beverage you consume, the alcohol itself contains 7 calories per gram, almost double what most carbohydrates and proteins have (4 calories per gram).
Additionally, calories from alcohol are often referred to as “empty calories” because they can not be converted to glycogen and used as energy–your body can’t do anything with them.
### 6. Better Skin
6. Better Skin
Alcohol dehydrates you, it’s a simple fact. One of the byproducts of this is a disruption of blood flow that lessons the amount of oxygen getting to your skin. This makes your skin dry and reduces its elasticity, leading to pigmented spots and wrinkles. If you cut out alcohol and properly hydrate instead, it’ll do wonders for your skin.
### 7. More Time Spent Doing Healthier Things
7. More Time Spent Doing Healthier Things
For most people, alcohol consumption tends to coincide with other less-than-stellar choices when it comes to their overall well being. A night out binge drinking often involves poor hydration, unhealthy foods and staying up later than normal, which causes a disruption in sleep consistency and regular bedtime routines.
There’s also the notion of addition by subtraction–if you’re not drinking, whatever else you’re doing instead is probably better for your body (and immune system). Whether it’s going to bed earlier, getting in some extra exercise, or even just kicking back on the couch and reading a book, it’s a healthier experience than drinking.",1/2/22

If you’re participating in an alcohol-free month this year, you’ll likely notice fairly quickly that the benefits of not drinking are reflected in your WHOOP data. Among other things, you’ll see higher HRV, lower resting heart rates, fewer disturbances in your sleep, more time spent in the restorative stages of sleep, better recoveries, and an ability to take on greater amounts of strain.
Plus, based on all these positive effects from taking a break from alcohol, research indicates there’s a very good chance you’ll be motivated by the results and continue to drink less in the future.

Females have unique nutritional requirements due to fluctuations in sex hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, throughout the mensural cycle and lifecycle. Research in this field is lacking and conflicting. However, an absence of evidence is not evidence of absence and this is something all women can start to consider on an individual level–especially athletes who really want to squeeze out that extra 1%.
Start by tracking your dietary habits across your cycle, noting things like nutrient intake, cravings, hunger levels, and energy levels. Also track your training, sleep, and recovery, which can easily be done using your WHOOP. In fact, WHOOP even has a new feature (called Menstrual Cycle Insightsing) which can make sleep and training recommendations based on where you are in your cycle.
As you collect more data and insight into how your body changes and responds across the menstrual cycle, you will be able to make more informed nutrition and training decisions unique to you!

In practice, men still outperform women in endurance sports and events. What is interesting though is that this gender difference may be as low as 4% in ultra-marathons (which are > 100 miles in length) and basically negligible in ultra-cycling events (which are > 400-500 miles) (6,7). Furthermore, females generally outperform males in long-distance open-water swimming (> 30 km)(8,9).
The unique sex-specific factors that seem to give females an edge in ultra-endurance sport is not just down to fuel selection, but also different muscle fibre make up and fatiguability, lower energy requirements, and amount and distribution of body fat (better for buoyancy in ultra-distance swimming).
The difference in fuel selection between the sexes is thought to be largely mediated by estrogen, which brings us to the next question–is there a difference in fuel selection across the menstrual cycle?
The short answer is yes. The caveat is… it’s complicated.
Hormone levels change during varying phases of the menstrual cycle.",11/23/21
sports-nutrition-menstrual-cycle,Sports Nutrition for Women & How the Menstrual Cycle Impacts It,"Compared to men, do women have different needs when it comes to fueling for sport and exercise?
## Burning Fat vs. Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates and fat are the key energy sources used during exercise. Protein cannot be stored so it is not an official energy reserve, but it can be used for fuel in certain situations.
As exercise intensity increases, carbohydrate (mostly from glycogen stores in the muscle) contributes the most energy, whereas fat is a more important fuel at lower intensity exercise. This holds true for both sexes.
However, compared to men, women tend to burn more fat for fuel at the same relative intensity of activity. In other words, women rely on carbohydrates less and burn fat more for fuel than men do at a higher intensity (1-5).
Theoretically, if women burn more fat, and spare the smaller (more precious) glycogen stores in the muscle, this would prevent them “hitting the wall,” allowing them to keep going for longer, and therefore, make them more suitable for endurance sports.
Burning more fat during exercise Than men allows for women to potentially have greater success in endurance sports (graph adapted from mysportscience.com/Venables et al., 2005).",11/23/21
sports-nutrition-menstrual-cycle,Sports Nutrition for Women & How the Menstrual Cycle Impacts It,"Practical Recommendations for Nutrition Based on Menstrual Cycle
Research in this field is in its infancy (and conflicting) so we don’t have enough evidence yet to start making blanket recommendations for nutrition across the menstrual cycle. So, the advice provided here should be used as a guide and not the rule. Nutritional recommendations will also vary from person to person and are dependent on your goals (e.g. strength or weight loss).
### Follicular phase
Follicular phase
Specific nutrition recommendations are less important during this phase. However, menstruation (early follicular phase) is an inflammatory process in and of itself, so during this time you might be more vulnerable to infection and take longer to recover. Make sure you’re getting enough rest, adequate sleep, hydration and good nutrition (now is the time to amp up your colorful fruit and veg!) (18).
### Luteal phase
Luteal phase
Due to increased energy expenditure during this time and preference for fat over carbohydrates for fuel, ensure you’re including plenty of healthy fat sources in the diet such as avocado, nut butter, nuts and seeds, and at least one portion of oily fish per week.
There is also increased metabolism of amino acids during this phase, so increasing protein intake will help account for this while supporting strength adaptations and recovery. Protein is also satiating and can help with increased hunger and cravings that people usually experience in the late luteal phase.
While your body may rely less on carbohydrates for fuel during this time, they’re still extremely important in the diet and will further support your training and recovery, regardless of the phase of your menstrual cycle. Opting for complex carbohydrates (whole grains, legumes, fruit and vegetables) over foods high in sugar (such as cakes, sweets, chocolate, ice-cream) may help control carbohydrate cravings and support mood and energy levels by stabilizing your blood glucose levels.",11/23/21
sports-nutrition-menstrual-cycle,Sports Nutrition for Women & How the Menstrual Cycle Impacts It,"Fueling Needs & Menstrual Cycle Phases
In the luteal phase (second half of the cycle), research shows that women rely less on carbohydrate for fuel (compared to in the follicular phase) during moderate-intensity endurance exercise (4,10). In addition to burning more fat for fuel in the luteal phase, there is also increased use and breakdown of protein, which also comes with increased metabolic rate during this time (11-13).
The body is smart, and to account for this we also see increased hunger, cravings and food intake, particularly in the late luteal phase (14).
Here comes the caveat–findings are very conflicting and most studies have only seen minor differences, with others having found no difference in fuel selection across the menstrual cycle (4, 10, 15-17). These differences in findings are likely due to exercise intensity (which is the primary determinant of what fuel we use during exercise) and individual differences between women in response to hormonal fluctuations across the cycle (17).",11/23/21

While there is no simple formula for boosting the amount of time you spend in any of the stages of sleep, there are behaviors you can adopt to give yourself the best chance at an efficient night of sleep. Here are some good practices we’ve learned from the leading studies on sleep science:
The darker your room, the better you sleep. Light influences the wake stage of sleep so the darker you can get your room, the more time you will get in the restorative stages.
The darker your room, the better you sleep. Light influences the wake stage of sleep so the darker you can get your room, the more time you will get in the restorative stages.
Set your room temperature at or around 68 degrees. You will fall asleep quicker when your bedroom is slightly cool.
Your bed is not a multi-use space. The more you can train your body to associate your bed with sleep, the more adept you will be at falling asleep in that space. As such, avoid work and leisure time spent in your bed.
Screens are stimulating and keep you awake. Avoid using your phone or computer in bed, screen time makes it more difficult to fall asleep.
Set a cut-off time for caffeine intake. Caffeine has a lingering presence for many hours after consumption. For greater sleep efficiency, consciously refrain from caffeine consumption at least 4 hours before bed.
Plan ahead when consuming alcohol. Just as caffeine intake impacts the body hours after consumption, so too does alcohol. Keep this in mind on a night out so that your sleep performance doesn’t suffer.
Fall asleep and wake up at similar times each day. We call this sleep consistency, and studies have shown it can improve the quality and efficiency of your time in bed (check out The Circadian Rhythm Sleep Hack).",11/1/19
stages-of-sleep-cycles,Understanding Sleep Cycles and the Stages of Sleep,"## Stages of Sleep: Light, Slow Wave Sleep (SWS), REM, Wake
Light sleep
Slow Wave Sleep (SWS), also known as deep sleep, is the time when your muscles repair and grow. During this stage the body produces 95% of its daily supply of growth hormones. As an athlete, training sessions break down muscle tissue so that it can rebuild and grow during slow wave sleep.
deep sleep
REM sleep
Wake is included as a sleep stage because it is natural to be awake for brief periods many times in the night. These periods are known as arousals, or “disturbances” in the WHOOP app, and it is normal to experience anywhere from 10-20 per night. While they only last a few minutes and you’re not conscious of them, you can lose upwards of an hour of sleep in the Wake stage due to disturbances.
## Heart Rate in a Typical Night’s Sleep Cycle Stages
Sleep is entered through light sleep, transitions to SWS within about 10 minutes, then to REM sleep somewhere around 90 minutes after falling asleep. An arousal will follow and a new sleep cycle will begin from there. As mentioned above, a normal night of sleep will contain 3-5 complete cycles, with more possible the longer you sleep.
## Time Spent in Each Stage of Sleep
The amount of time a person will spend in each sleep stage varies night by night. In general, a healthy break down to aim for is the following:

The initial recommendation from the Strain Target is based on an optimal state to maintain your fitness level (WHOOP members will recognize this from the Weekly Performance Assessment, but instead of simply analyzing last week’s trends you have access to this information 24/7, in real time). However, that is not always going to be your desired outcome.
The Strain Target allows you to adjust your goal depending on what your intent is. Maybe you’re tapering prior to a big event, and prefer to train in a restorative state to allow for active recovery? Or, maybe you’d like to push yourself to make fitness gains with a period of functional overreaching?
Once you’ve set your goal, the Strain Target lets you know how long and hard to work out in order to meet that goal–whether to keep pushing yourself, or if you’re overdoing it. This allows athletes to make smarter and more informed decisions in the moment.

WHOOP members have long been familiar our Sleep Planner, which takes sleep monitoring to the next level by suggesting exactly when to go to bed and wake up in order to meet your daily performance goals.
This applies a similar approach to strain (a measure of exertion which we track on a 0-21 scale, both for individual workouts and for your entire day) and makes the transition from feedback to coaching.
## How it Works
The Strain Target gives you an exertion-level recommendation based on your recovery (a daily metric for how ready your body is to take on strain) and strain you’ve already accumulated. When you start an activity, it shows your strain building in real time towards the suggested goal. You can also see how many calories you’re burning and which heart rate zone you’re operating in.",6/7/19

Normally we utilize WHOOP to improve our performance in the workplace, but as it turns out, it was just as useful on our vacation to the Florida Keys.
With a Nursing degree and a background in exercise physiology and functional medicine, I understand how fast the Florida sun and fighting tides can turn on you if you underestimate them. Having already been to the Keys the past two years with my best friend, Captain Jacob Griffin, I knew that our previous experience would serve us well. Previously, I had allowed my ego to take over. Having a 400-pound bench press and 500-pound deadlift can make snorkeling seem like a walk around the block. I wouldn’t allow myself to be fooled again this year.
In preparation for the trip, both Blaine and I upped our endurance training eight weeks in advance. We also each partook in cyclic ketogenic diets, along with a good bit of hypoxic training and breath work. It took me three weeks to get my static breath hold from 2:01 minutes to 3:02. When you are 30-40 feet under water, 30 seconds can make all the difference between getting the perfect angle to spear a Mahi Mahi, or having to come back up and prepare another breath at the surface.
I know guys who train for months in preparation for Elk hunting trips in the mountains, yet so many people overlook the demand and energy requirements of freediving–without utilizing oxygen tanks, divers are forced to hold their breath as they descend in search of fish.
After arriving in the Keys Saturday morning (somewhat sleep deprived from our early flight), Blaine and I joked about how we missed our workout for the day. Kayaks available at the rental house offered us an opportunity to break a quick sweat while scouting for lobster and hogfish:",8/15/17

But then again, holding your breath for 2-3 minutes at a time and freediving to the ocean floor isn’t exactly a typical vacation activity.
My brother Blaine and I, born and raised in south Louisiana, are no stranger to endurance sports and athletic competition. Blaine, a former NCAA catcher for Louisiana Lafayette’s own Ragin’ Cajuns, has participated in multiple marathons and triathlons since his baseball heyday. Considering that his wife has qualified for the Boston Marathon the past two years, he really doesn’t have a choice but to keep up.
I have my own share of fitness experience, having participated in everything from bodybuilding to triathlons as well.
The two of us currently own a Functional Medicine clinic in Lafayette. We also lead an annual Executive Health/Leadership group called HP3. Members sign on for the purpose of improving the mind, body, and spirit. Guiding our group really enlightens us to the power of tracking the rest, recovery, and performance of our “corporate athletes.”
Each one of our executives wears a WHOOP strap and I give them daily feedback based on their data. If one of our guys drinks too much the night before, I am on it. When one of them trains too hard the previous day and is seeking diet and recovery advice, I’m on it. And if one has a child who’s up all night with a virus and needs lifestyle tweaks to operate optimally the following day, I am on that too.
Most lifestyle performance coaches base their recommendations on excel spread sheets and “tested algorithms.” I like to think we know better. We understand that life and business are anything but predictable and recipes don’t exist. WHOOP allows us to guide our guys the most efficacious way possible–day by day.",8/15/17

Again, as you can see below, the constant diving, netting and getting in and out of the boat took its toll on me:
At the beginning of the trip, we made a decision to take it easy in the evenings. We knew how exhausted and poorly recovered we’d be if we stayed up late drinking. After cleaning the fish and boat and prepping for the next day, we barely managed to get 5-6 hours of sleep per night.
I was able to maintain decent Recovery levels throughout the week, until our early-morning flight home on Thursday:
Having utilized WHOOP for several months now, I realized right away that if I treated this adventure like a normal vacation, I could kiss my green Recoveries and three-minute breath holds goodbye. Without maximizing what little time I had for for sleep and recovery, I’m confident the trip wouldn’t have been the success it was.
I coach so many people that set their workout schedule for the week and stick to it relentlessly. If you aren’t tracking Recovery and Strain of your workouts and other activities, you’re guessing at best and asking for illness or injury. WHOOP provides the perfect display of lifestyle and exercise balance, while at work or at play.

The next few days of WHOOP data were eye opening, to say the least. It’s just not part of one’s thought process to assume that you will effectively double your Strain while on vacation.
Sunday was spent all day on the water:
We headed out to 400 feet of water, then went deeper looking for grass lines (lines of seaweed that accumulate offshore and tend to hold large numbers of bait fish, which inevitably attract the larger fish). In this situation, once you find the fish, it is a matter of putting on your gear and executing. Freediving with a ripping tide is anything but easy. Static breath holds are one thing. Kicking three-foot long fins deep underwater is a whole different ball game.
The day passed with each of us taking turns fighting fish on the line, diving down to spear them, and keeping the camera over the shoulder of the person with the spear gun.
Monday brought with it a significant amount of nasty thunderstorms, so we were forced to stay dry and dock the boat. We took advantage of the rest. We needed it.
On Tuesday, we decided to head to Jupiter, FL to wrestle with the goliath grouper in that area. Jeff, our ship’s captain on this voyage, was the only one on the boat with any experience angling grouper in that area. You see pictures and videos of these fish on the internet, but until you encounter them up close and personal, you really can’t appreciate the sheer mass. Still, going toe-to-toe with one in a tug of war match was what we came for.
Surprisingly, as much of a fight that a fish of that size can put up, muscling the grouper didn’t create as much strain for me as freediving did. My heart rate only climbed into the 100-120 beats-per-minute range (a far cry from the 150-170 BPM that resulted from my deep free dives):",8/15/17

A hotel banquet hall was filled with 150 of my peers and senior colleagues, also the people who were going to have to write letters in support of my tenure packet. I was presenting a really big paper that’d been featured on the front page of the New York Times a few days earlier and hyped from here to infinity. Just a few minutes beforehand, one very famous economist walked up to me and said ‘I came to hear you give this lecture!’ ‘Oh great,’ I though, ‘that really calms the nerves.’”
Zack described the moment that could potentially make his career as “an incredibly aggressive environment where folks ask a lot of questions and push very, very hard.” There’s no hiding,” he said. “It’s just you standing up in front of a big group and showing what you’ve done in the face of very intense and real scrutiny.

I think a lot of folks who played sports on a high level when they were young stay pretty into it, that mentality never goes away.”
This can be particularly true for a former college athlete who’s career has brought him back to campus. While motorcycle riding is a hobby for Zack, the fire to compete still fuels his professional life.
“I really care about being at the super pointy end of my profession,” he said. “I’ve been very fortunate to have a job at one of the best universities and to do research that I think is making the world a better place. That’s what I care most about. Exercise and nutrition are one means to help, but when I discovered WHOOP I realized it was another tool that could really be useful.”

Below is a two-week sample of William’s daily strain and recovery. Low strain prior to the race enabled him to hit the starting line with a nice string of green recoveries, including 88% for Stage 1. William managed to keep his recovery in the green for the second day as well, but after that the immense strain and harsh conditions quickly began to take their toll.
William got his recovery back to 87% just two days after completing the grueling desert ultramarathon.
The day of “rest” did William little good following the race’s brutal 4th stage (47 miles, a 20.6 strain and 7,401 calories burned), as his Day 6 recovery was just 6%.
“The long stage on Day 4 had a 36-hour time window,” he explained. “Even though myself and a lot of competitors finished within 16 hours, on the fifth day people were constantly in and out of the tent recovering or still finishing off. It was my worst night’s sleep of the competition.”
However, William pushed through and completed the race with a time of 35 hours, 23 minutes and 55 seconds. Amazingly, it only took William two days of post-race recuperation (with strains below 5 each day) to get his recovery back to green–and it’s a good thing too, because he’s running the Zurich marathon on April 10.",4/8/22

“This was a new challenge and experience for me,” William told us. “So much of it was climbing jebels (mountains), running on soft sand, and going over dunes. Aside from the physical toll of completing those distances carrying a pack that started at 12.5 kgs, a lot of mental energy was used simply trying to find the most efficient route.”
William’s strain topped 20 for each of the first 4 stages as he burned an average of nearly 5,750 calories per day. Here are his daily stats from the race:
William had a 20.6 strain and burned 7,401 calories on Day 4, which was the longest stage at 47 miles.
“Once the days’ running had finished, there really was nothing to do other than eat and get an early night, which meant the hours I spent in bed were actually much higher than normal,” he said. “But in an environment where there was constant noise from the other competitors and my tent mates, my sleep was far more disturbed than usual.”",4/8/22

If you type “Marathon des Sables” into your search browser, the next word that likely follows is “deaths” (3 participants have died during it in the past 36 years).
The race lasts 7 days, and consists of 6 stages roughly the length of one marathon each–all through the Sahara Desert. Temperatures may reach 130 degrees Fahrenheit, and runners must carry all their food and everything else they need on their backs. The list of required supplies includes a compass (50-mile-an-hour sand storms can create zero visibility), an anti-venom pump in case of snake bites, and a mirror and whistle to signal for help.
Water is provided at regular checkpoints every 5-9 miles, and race participants sleep in large communal tents at night.

strength-training-myths,4 Strength Training Myths Debunked by Science,"Myth 1: Strength Training Reduces Flexibility
It’s a commonly held belief that weightlifting and other strength training exercises will cause muscle stiffness and reduce the overall range of motion, but research has found that this is untrue as long as the exercises are performed correctly.
In fact, strength training can notably improve joint stability, in turn enhancing your ability to move through full ranges of motion, and increasing overall critical flexibility. A study published in the International Journal of Exercise Science found that six months of resistance training was associated with improved flexibility in young men in areas like shoulder extension, knee flexion and elbow flexion. Another study found that strength training is just as effective as stretching for helping improve range of motion.
## Myth 2: Strength Training Makes You Bulky
One of the top reasons individuals, and often women, choose not to include strength training in their fitness regimens is the belief that lifting weights and other types of strength training exercises will make you “bulky.”
Strength training simply cannot transform your body overnight. Growing stronger relies on so much more than just strength training, from genetics to adequate nutrition and caloric surplus to increasing the body’s fat percentage, the proper hormonal balance, and more. If your goal is to build muscle mass and bulk up, your routine would likely focus on high volume, heavy weight, and hypertrophy.
On its own, strength training helps promote lean muscle mass and decrease body fat. The average individual who lifts weights 2-3 times a week will burn more calories than they consume, so they won’t have to worry about this strength training myth. When performed on this smaller scale, the benefits of strength training include improvements in muscle strength and tone.",5/8/23

Strength training is beneficial for people of all ages – not just those in their 20s and 30s.
People of all ages better their health through strength training, and with proper form, the benefits of strength training for adults or even mature individuals is just as critical as for younger populations. Gains include improved overall fitness, endurance, strength, and cardiovascular health, as well as reduced risk of injury and flexibility. In fact, a recent review of 15 studies ranging from 2006-2020 highlighted that even in frail adults, frailty was notably reduced after 24 weeks of resistance training.
Strength training is an important addition to the fitness routines of older adults. After age 30, muscle mass declines by 3-5% every ten years. This decrease speeds up after age 60. Muscle weakness is another natural effect of aging. Research has found that strength and resistance training exercises can help counteract these effects and help older adults see improvements in their ability to perform everyday physical activities.
This type of physical activity also increases both their muscle strength and mass, improves bone density and reduces the risk of osteoporosis, and boosts metabolism too, helping adults stick to a healthier weight. Some studies also indicate resistance training may lower rates of depression in aging adults as well. There is also recent scientific evidence that long-term strength training can prevent a decline of muscle strength and mobility, as we age.",5/8/23

False statements and advice related to health and fitness aren’t just untrue — they can be harmful, and even lead to injuries, muscle strains, weakness, and negative effects on the metabolism.
Many of these falsities don’t point to any scientific studies at all, and those that do reflect what WHOOP experts found, among others, to pull from research which is dominated by a male-only focus, and therefore only beneficial to half the global population. A WHOOP data science review of existing athletic performance research shows a mere 6% focused on the female population.
“This means that the ‘best practices’ guiding our training are mostly made up rather than rooted in science. Not only is this keeping women from reaching their true potential, but it also puts them at real — but avoidable — risks,” stated Emily Capodilupo, WHOOP SVP of Data Science and Research in her related TED talk exploring research done using continuous vital sign monitoring from wearable devices to highlight the damage done by excluding women from exercise physiology research.

strength-training-types,Understanding 4 Types of Strength Training,"Types of Strength Training
Strength training, at its most basic, is a form of exercise. In essence, the term refers to any fitness activity that involves the contractions of muscles against a force of resistance. Common sources of this resistance include free weights, resistance bands, and your own bodyweight. There are a few different strength training types, and countless variations of strength training exercises to choose from within these.
### Muscular Hypertrophy
Muscular hypertrophy is a type of strength training that promotes muscle growth and boosts muscle mass, and typically involves using heavier weights, with a higher number of repetitions (reps). With muscular hypertrophy, weight is applied to the fibers in your muscles, causing them to respond with force that counteracts the resistance being put against them.
This process causes mechanical damage to the muscle fibers, which signals the body to start the repair process. As the muscles are damaged and repaired over and over again through repeated strength training exercises, they get larger and stronger. This is what’s responsible for the gains in muscle mass and strength that are characteristic of strength training.
### Muscular Endurance
Instead of building muscle mass, muscular endurance, another type of strength training, increases the length of time your muscles can sustain muscular contractions. Muscular endurance is usually performed with lighter weights or your body weight with higher repetitions. One popular example of this is holding your body in plank position, muscles fully engaged, for one or two or more full minutes.
Heavier weights build muscle strength, while lighter weights used in repetition promote muscular endurance. Muscular endurance training is frequently used by endurance athletes who need to ensure their muscles can sustain long periods of activity.",5/8/23
strength-training-types,Understanding 4 Types of Strength Training,"Strength training offers strong benefits that make it a key addition to any fitness program. These benefits include increased muscular strength, improved cardiovascular health, and better flexibility. Strength training can also boost bone strength, reduce the chance of injuries, and positively impact mental health.
Getting all the benefits of strength training starts with identifying the right strength training routine for you. There are four strength training types, and their impact can be measured through HRV and WHOOP. Here’s how you can use these tools to increase the effectiveness of your strength training exercises.",5/8/23
strength-training-types,Understanding 4 Types of Strength Training,"Muscular Isolation Training
Muscular isolation is yet another type of strength training targeting only one specific body area at a time during a workout. This type of strength training allows athletes to zero in on specific muscle groups and ensure that particular muscles aren’t neglected or undertrained. For example, bicep curls are a muscular isolation exercise solely involving the bicep muscles.
### Push-Pull Workouts
Push-pull workouts involve grouping the muscles in the body by the way they move — either by pushing or pulling and then working out all pushing muscles together and all pulling muscles together. Each type of muscle is usually exercised on separate days.
For example, the first day might exercise pushing muscles like the shoulders, triceps and chest. Pulling muscles, including the forearms, biceps and back, would be targeted the next day. Alternatively, the pushing and pulling days might include a rest day in between.
After these muscle groups are exercised, a day is usually dedicated to the leg muscles. Push-pull workouts aim to prevent muscle imbalances, ensure all muscle groups are targeted, and allow maximal recovery time to promote muscle strength and growth increases.",5/8/23
strength-training-types,Understanding 4 Types of Strength Training,"How Strength Training affects HRV
Strength training often places intense demands on the body to increase muscle mass, strength, or endurance. When training intensely, dips in heart rate variability, or HRV, can be expected, given low HRV is common with difficult workouts. HRV is a measure of the variation in between each heartbeat. High HRV indicates that the body is ready to perform optimally and respond to environmental changes. A lower HRV is considered normal if it occurs in the short term in response to a physical challenge such as a workout. However, when HRV is low over a longer period, it could indicate something else is at play, such as dehydration, fatigue, or illness.

stress-hrv-resting-heart-rate,"Impact of Stress on HRV, Resting Heart Rate & Recovery","Stress is something that we all deal with on a regular basis. Among other things, short-term effects of stress may include headaches, nausea, loss of appetite, moodiness, muscle tension, insomnia, and an inability to focus. In the long term, stress can lead to anxiety disorders and mental health issues, high blood pressure, heart attacks, risk of heart disease, obesity, eating disorders, digestive problems, unhealthy skin, hair loss, and a variety of other significant health concerns.
These are just a few of the many potential consequences of feeling overly stressed. And while the symptoms of stress have been extensively researched, the day-to-day impact of it on our mental and physical well being is difficult to quantify.
## Stress and Resting Heart Rate
Overall, 60% of the time our members input experiencing stress it results in an increase in resting heart rate (not good). The average (50th percentile of all cases) is an uptick of 1 beat per minute (bpm). Considering the fact that RHR is generally a fairly stable metric, this is a sizable deviation from the norm. At the 25th percentile, the rise is 2 heart beats per minute.
Males and females see similar changes in resting heart rate due to stress, as do most age groups. However, it is worth noting that the frequency with which RHR is negatively impacted increases subtly with age. For 29 and under it happens on 58% of occasions, for ages 30-49 it’s 60%, and for 50-59 it’s 64% of the time.

One of the most commonly recommended ways to reduce stress is simply to get regular exercise. The WHOOP Strain Target can help you meet daily activity goals without overdoing it.
Relaxation techniques such as meditation, mindfulness and controlled breathing are also quite successful for many people. Beyond that (and by no means is this an all-inclusive list), here are some other popular activities and behaviors people engage in to relieve stress:
Spend quality time with friends and family, and laugh
Listen to soothing music
Aromatherapy (burn scented candles)
Draw, paint or color
Write in a journal, in particular express feeling of gratitude
Practice yoga
Cut back caffeine intake

## Tracking Stress in the WHOOP Journal
The WHOOP Journal feature gives you the option each morning to log if you experienced stress the day before. By doing this, we can examine the effect your stress may have on metrics we track, like resting heart rate, heart rate variability, recovery, and duration of each stage of sleep.
Every month, you then get an analysis of how stress (and other behaviors you choose to track) can affect your WHOOP data via our Monthly Performance Assessments.
In this case, we took a look at the aggregate data of WHOOP members reporting stress. As you might expect, we found it often has negative correlations with several key physiological markers.

With heart rate variability, reported stress unfavorably affects HRV at a 63% frequency. It also occurs a bit more often with women (64%) than men (62%). The average change across the board is a decrease of 4 milliseconds (ms). At the 25th percentile, the drop is 8 ms.
The negative effects of stress on HRV actually become slightly less substantial as people get older. The median difference is -5 ms through 29 years of age, -4 for 30-39, and just -3 for ages 40-69.
Stress has a negative effect on Heart rate variability as well.
## How Stress aFfects Recovery
Both resting heart rate and HRV play important roles in your daily WHOOP recovery (how prepared you body is to perform from 0-100%), so it’s no surprise that stress can hurt this metric as well.
Collectively, our members experience a decrease in recovery 64% of the time after logging stress. The average impact is a decline of 6%.
The average daily WHOOP recovery is 58%. When members report experiencing stress, the median impact is a decrease of 6%.
Recovery is affected by stress marginally more for females than males–65% of the time compared to 64%, and with a 7% drop on average rather than 6%.

There is a fine line between acknowledging your cup is full and taking a break from a social situation to avoid burnout and self-isolating due to anxiety or depression.
### 4. Difficulty sleeping or insomnia
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep are both common stress symptoms. This can occur for many reasons, but an obvious one is that something on your mind is causing you emotional distress. A nightly routine that includes dedicated time to unwind and breathwork, like the breathing sessions available in the WHOOP app as part of the Stress Monitor experience, can help mediate symptoms of stress by boosting mood, lowering anxiety and decreasing respiratory rates.

stress-symptoms,4 Stress Symptoms You Should Never Ignore (And How to Cope),"4 Stress Symptoms You Should Never Ignore
Psychology Today says stress is our body’s built-in response to danger. It is a surging of hormones that tells our body to fight, freeze, or flee from a situation. It doesn’t matter if the “danger” causing you to stress is real or imagined; your body will be unable to tell the difference.
Here are symptoms of stress that you should never ignore:
### 1. Changes in your overall mood or way of thinking
Feeling agitated, exhausted, anxious or short-tempered lately? Your overall stress may be causing you to react to people and situations in ways you typically wouldn’t.
Mood swings, ranging from irritability to sadness, are some of the many natural and common emotional responses to stress in your body and mind. Brain fog and racing thoughts are other common stress symptoms to be aware of and monitor internally.
WHOOP helps you recognize stress levels rising in your body in the moment and provides you with coping and management tools to use in real-time, including breathing techniques, to reduce stress levels and improve your health and happiness.
### 2. Experiencing chest pains, headaches and upset stomach.
It’s important to note that stress doesn’t just cause mental or emotional symptoms; your body can experience physical symptoms, too. When you lead an active lifestyle, you are acutely attuned to your body and its ability to perform and respond.
In addition to celebrating when you reach a fitness goal, it’s equally important to pay attention when your body is letting you know it’s in distress and needs a rest. Generally speaking, these are known as somatic symptoms, including aches and pains, headache, upset stomach, dizziness, and shaking.",4/10/23

stretching-for-golf,PGA Coach Breaks Down the Basics of Stretching vs. Warming Up,"Golf Stretching vs. Warming Up
As mentioned above, stretching for golf is very different from warming up your body. At TPI, our philosophy is that you should always warm the body up before stretching any muscle. Believe it or not, this can be done simply by making a few slow-motion golf swings, walking some stairs, or just doing a few squats–anything to get the heart rate up and the body moving through a complete range of motion.
WHOOP can be quite useful here to monitor our increase in heart rate and strain. Once we see that HR spike we can then move into more of an active stretching routine to help distract the joints and stretch the fascia on top of the muscle.
My favorite form of stretching (after the body is warmed up) is relatively new, but is being used by many of today’s elite golfers. It is called ELDOA, which my friend Dan Hellman is an expert on. Incorporating some of these stretches into your program can do some amazing things for anyone’s range of motion.

Basically, you never want to stretch a cold muscle, so elevating your body’s core temperature is an essential thing to do before stretching.
## 5 Types of Stretching
watch the video
### STATIC STRETCHING
STATIC STRETCHING
A muscle is taken to a point of stretch and held there for a period of time. The muscle is then relaxed and the process is repeated. This can improve range of motion, but does not really increase the body’s core temperature.
### PASSIVE STRETCHING
PASSIVE STRETCHING
Similar to static stretching, but with a partner who slowly stretches you. It is important that your partner be careful and make sure not to overstretch you, which can cause injury.
### DYNAMIC STRETCHING
DYNAMIC STRETCHING
This involves active motions during which you gradually increase their range and speed. Good examples of dynamic stretching are arm circles, leg swings and squats. I like this form of stretching as it often mimics the sport you play and takes you through a full variety of movements.
### BALLISTIC STRETCHING
BALLISTIC STRETCHING
In this case, you take a muscle past its normal range of motion. This is a much more aggressive form of stretching that invokes something called the stretch reflex–the muscles contract to fight against the bouncing. It is often done by elite athletes once their body is fully warmed up. I would not recommend this without proper supervision from a trained professional as it can increase your risk of injury.
### PROPIOCEPTIVE NEUROMUSCULAR FACILITATION (PNF)
PROPIOCEPTIVE NEUROMUSCULAR FACILITATION (PNF)
Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation or “contract, relax stretching,” is usually done with a partner. The partner pushes the athlete to a stretched position, then the athlete pushes back and holds the contraction. This can be very effective for increased range of motion.",7/7/20

It may come as no surprise that in a situation where people aren’t commuting to work or going out at night they are able to get more sleep, and even exercise more as well. However, what makes this so compelling is that this unprecedented naturally occurring experimental condition allowed for a study of such an enormous magnitude. Changes that may seem small on the surface have a much greater statistical significance when considering the incredibly large data set examined.
This is also the first study to quantify the effect on health related behaviors – such as sleep timing and duration, and exercise frequency and intensity – of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated social distancing mandates. It is the first to indicate that physical distancing actually had measurable population level impacts on physiological parameters (like resting heart rate and HRV).
Additionally, the findings are impactful beyond COVID-19 specifically as this is the first paper that has ever shown that such a small change in sleep and exercise has this measurable effect on cardiovascular health.
## WHOOP Proof of Concept
The findings suggest that our cardiovascular health is sensitive to small behavior changes. While the responses are proportionally small, this demonstrates the WHOOP philosophy that a series of small behavior changes to daily life can – over relatively short periods of time – add up to real performance edges.
## Going Forward
This study showed that a positive externality of the COVID-19 pandemic was that it created an opportunity to revert to more natural sleep/wake patterns, and that the removal of social and professional obligations that compete for our time allowed for more time to exercise.
As the world’s economies reopen and we are once again faced with more competing demands for our time, we are curious to follow up and see if these impactful behavior changes are maintained.",6/18/20

High spirits in Tampa Bay last night brought some low recoveries this morning. Post-Super Bowl stats are in and it looks like WHOOP members in Tampa, Kansas City and even Boston could use some extra Zzzzz’s today.

## Sleep & Recovery Changes in Super Bowl Cities
The “Super Bowl hangover” was felt even more significantly on a localized level, where we examined data from the home cities of our members. In Tampa Bay, the average recovery for recent Mondays is 60%.
Today? It’s 47%.
For Kansas City, the average Monday recovery of late has been 58%, with a sleep duration of 6:58. This morning those fell to 52% and 6:46.
And what about Boston, home of WHOOP HQ and many long-time fans of a certain 7-time Super Bowl champion? Monday recoveries in Boston have averaged 62% lately, with sleep times of 7:17. Today they’re only 57% and 6:57.",2/8/21
super-bowl-effect-sleep-recovery,Super Bowl’s Effect on Sleep & Recovery,"Impact of Winning vs. Losing
It seems fairly clear that a Super Bowl victory has a more substantial impact on a fan base’s WHOOP metrics than a loss. Specifically, in Tampa Bay the average sleep duration last night dropped by 49 minutes, from 7:06 to 6:17 (compared to a 12-minute decline for KC). The decrease of 13% in recovery average was also much greater in Tampa than KC (6%).
Last year, when Kansas City won the Super Bowl, we saw recovery norms there fall 16% (from an average of 64% to 48%) and sleep averages shorten by 44 minutes (6:55 to 6:11).
In San Francisco a year ago (losers of the 2020 Super Bowl), average numbers slipped from 63% and 7:03 to 58% and 6:55–similar deviations to what happened in Kansas City today.
Also worth noting, the 47% average recovery for Tampa Bay residents this morning is the second worst of the past year, behind only New Year’s Eve (45%).
## Any Effects of COVID & Social Distancing?
Despite what was likely a very different game-watching experience for many people this year, the changes in WHOOP member metrics today are fairly similar to what they were the day after the Super Bowl last year.
A year ago Monday average recoveries were 62%, and they dropped to 59% on this day (the same 3% difference as today). In 2020 WHOOP members lost an average of 11 minutes of sleep at night following the Super Bowl (6:50 to 6:39), slightly fewer than the 14 minutes this year.",2/8/21
super-bowl-hangover-valentines-day,Football Hangovers on Valentine's Day: Breaking Down the Data,"Valentine’s Day Improves Recovery and HRV
In previous years we’ve learned that our members’ average recovery and heart rate variability are higher than usual on the day after Valentine’s Day. We’ve observed average recoveries go up 4%, and average HRV increase by 6.6% (65 milliseconds compared to 61 ms).
Valentine’s Day has a positive impact on WHOOP members’ average recovery and HRV.
Are there common behaviors we engage in on Valentine’s Day that are beneficial to HRV? Things like expressing gratitude, acts of kindness, recalling positive experiences, and engaging in relationships you value can all positively affect heart rate variability.
## Impact on Sex
Also worth noting, based on information logged in the journal our members have more sex on Valentine’s Day. Roughly 40% more, in fact, than on the same day of the week normally. It’s by far the biggest jump we see for any day of the year (by comparison New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day are second with a 9% increase).
When it comes to a correlation with next-day recovery, we found that sex logged earlier in the day leads to 1% higher recoveries than when it happens around bedtime.
Tying it all back to the Super Bowl, last year we noticed very little change in reported sex that day in the region of the winning team (Tampa), but a massive 37% drop-off in the Kansas City area (the losing team). The same holds true again this year, however the dip is even greater in Cincinnati, down 58%.
Sorry about that Cincinnati, hopefully things turn around for you today!",2/14/22
super-bowl-hangover-valentines-day,Football Hangovers on Valentine's Day: Breaking Down the Data,"Mondays are usually the day of the week when our members have the highest average recovery, and for the past six weeks that number has been 65%. But on the Monday after the Super Bowl, that’s not the case. As expected, the average WHOOP recovery today in the United States is down to 61%.
The good news is today also happens to be Valentine’s Day, which we’ve discovered may actually help boost your recovery tomorrow. Our research also shows that people have more sex on Valentine’s Day, but will that still happen when factoring in the Super Bowl hangover?
## Super Bowl Decreases Sleep & Recovery
Overall, WHOOP members slept about 18 minutes less last night compared to recent baseline averages.
A year ago recoveries took a much bigger dive among fans of the winning team than they did for the losing team–dropping from 60% to 47% in the Tampa Bay area compared to 58% to 52% around Kansas City.
However, this year the opposite is true. The stats from Los Angeles mimic the national averages (from 65% to 61%), but in Cincinnati today’s average recovery is just 51%.
Recovery after the Super Bowl is much lower in Cincinnati than elsewhere.
What could this mean? LA residents may not be as enamored with their football team (which recently moved back there from St. Louis, where the average recovery today is 60%) as other cities and possibly didn’t celebrate as much.
On the other hand, based on data from our journal feature, reports of alcohol consumption increased by 93% in Cincinnati last night (by far the most of any city we tracked).",2/14/22
swimmer-carson-foster-training-ncaa-championships,World-Class Swimmer Carson Foster on Prepping for Collegiate Championships with WHOOP,"The youngest of 3 swimming siblings, Carson Foster found great success in the pool at a very early age. As a 10-year-old in 2012, he became the youngest person ever to swim the 50-meter butterfly in under 30 seconds. He also broke Michael Phelps’ National Age Group record in 100 fly.
A year ago as a college freshman, Carson was part of a gold-medal-winning relay team in the 4 x 200 freestyle at the NCAA championships. Last June, he just barely missed qualifying for the United States Olympic team.
## The Trials and Getting on WHOOP
“At Olympic trials I missed the team in three events by about a total of two seconds,” Carson told us. “That was a minor setback and kind of what led me to get into WHOOP. I was like, ‘Where can I make my next step in terms of enhancing my swimming?’ The biggest thing I saw was that I could be better with my recovery and my sleep. Getting that information at hand was kind of the natural evolution of me taking my swimming as if it was my job.”
## Understanding Heart Rate Variability
“Once I started using WHOOP, over the last 8 months it’s become a hobby of mine to research ways to increase HRV, really learn what heart rate variability is,” Carson explained. His older brother Jake also swims with him at the University of Texas. “I created a team on WHOOP so we can all see each other’s data. I know HRV is individualized and it’s best for you to compare it to yourself, but it is interesting how mine is significantly higher than Jake’s,” he said with a laugh.
“That’s why I really like WHOOP recovery. If you had something that was solely tracking your resting heart rate or HRV it’d be cool, but it wouldn’t be really helpful in terms of seeing where you are comparatively.”
From Carson’s most recent WHOOP MONTHLY PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT, his HRV has been trending in the right direction since last October.",3/21/22
swimmer-carson-foster-training-ncaa-championships,World-Class Swimmer Carson Foster on Prepping for Collegiate Championships with WHOOP,"Strain and Tapering
“When I’m on taper I try to make sure no matter what I’m keeping my strain under a certain amount,” Carson told us. “Based on my recovery WHOOP will say something like ‘Stay within 9.5-14.6 for optimal training. I don’t really listen to that normally when I’m in the training cycle, but when I’m on taper I keep my strain below that. If it doesn’t want me to go above 13 strain, then I’m going to make my workout pretty easy. But if I have a 95% recovery and it’s saying not to go above 17, I’m OK to do some aerobic work and kind of get after it a bit. WHOOP has definitely helped me make sure I’m not overreaching.”
Carson’s MPA shows “restorative” training behavior while tapering for the World Championships last December, where he won gold in the 4 x 200 freestyle relay.
## Prepping for NCAA Championships
“My biggest thing for the next couple of weeks is really making sure I can average good sleep,” he said. “Last year when I was on spring break I thought ‘I can sleep in, I can go to bed late and spring break is the week before the meet so I’ll be fine.’ But then I couldn’t actually sleep in past 7:30 so I was probably getting about six-and-a-half hours of sleep per night the week before NCAAs.”
Carson’s day strain indicates he began dialing back his training load about a month prior to the national championships.
“Last year I was also thinking about swimming 24-7 and stressing myself out by watching YouTube videos from past meets, which I thought was getting me excited. But in reality, it was just making me nervous for no reason. I’ve been to a million swim meets. I know what it’s going to be like so there’s no point in worrying about it before. Ultimately I’m only in control of myself, so as long as I can focus on myself there’s no need to worry about anyone else.”",3/21/22
swimmer-carson-foster-training-ncaa-championships,World-Class Swimmer Carson Foster on Prepping for Collegiate Championships with WHOOP,"Locking in Sleep
“I’ve noticed that when I go to sleep past 10:30 my recoveries are significantly worse,” Carson noted. “There’s something about my circadian rhythm where I can’t sleep in past 7 am. And so knowing that, I’ve had to make changes. I have a setting on my phone now where everything, except for what I’d need case of an emergency, is shut off at 8:30. I can’t go on any social media past 8:30 or get any calls from people outside my family, so nothing is keeping me awake. I’m always in bed now by about 8:45.”
Data from WHOOP has helped Carson improve his sleep:
“I see sometimes in the morning that I’ll have a lot of disturbances, so I began researching what those could be. I started wearing earplugs at night to see what would happen. It made them decrease significantly and my sleep efficiency went up. That’s what I think is so fun about having the data, finding these little things that can make it better. At this point I’m also not even doing it for my swimming, I’m just doing it because I want my stats to be better.”
IN the past 6 months Carson has had just 1 red recovery, UNDERSTANDABLY ON NEW YEAR’S DAY.
## Stress and Recovery
“The biggest thing that affects my HRV and recovery scores is how stressed I am the day or night before,” Carson pointed out. “When I noticed that trend I started using the WHOOP journal more to see what kinds of things make my score go up and down–thinking about the things that make me stress and trying to eliminate those.”
“When I’m stressed out about a school project or something it makes my recovery go down,” he added. “So, I rescheduled my day to try to help with that. Now I wake up in the morning, crank out all my schoolwork, and have everything done by the time I go to practice so I don’t have any stressors after that. I can just come home and relax, eat dinner, watch an episode or two of Netflix, call my parents, and go to bed.”

swimming-the-distance-for-team-usa,Connor Jaeger's Heart Rate Monitor for Swimming: WHOOP,"Training & Recovery
An Olympic training regimen consists of 24/7 preparation, strict dieting, going to bed early, waking up before the sun, and putting their sport ahead of everything else. Now imagine doing all that while studying as an undergraduate in college? The importance of balancing training and recovery becomes even more vital for an athlete’s success in this situation.
“I was always up late and was always hustling from one thing to another. I’d be running out of the pool trying to get to my 8am class; trying to squeeze my lunch in and trying to find time for recovery. I’d have to find time even if I had to sacrifice something in the middle of the day so I could get to bed before 11pm.”",7/30/16
swimming-the-distance-for-team-usa,Connor Jaeger's Heart Rate Monitor for Swimming: WHOOP,"Being On WHOOP
Now that Jaeger is a member of Team WHOOP, he’s adapted his mental and physical approach to training. “While using WHOOP, I’ve been able to actually score my recovery every night, so I now know the things during my day that are affecting my sleep and recovery.”
With WHOOP data, Connor has been able to optimize his routine in a way that’s allowed him to feel more rested on a regular basis. “I was an engineer in college so I appreciate the data. I can now confidently say that whatever I did yesterday benefited me today and there is a reason why I feel this way. It’s all about being smart and using the details to achieve peak performance.”
“I’m looking for that 1% change. I’m looking for that .01 second in a race that will make me better. I’m looking for anything. I’ve done a lot of changing in the pool and I’ve done a lot of changing on dry land with mobility. Sleep is one way we can make changes that we never thought of.”
Connor’s approach to training and recovery goes against the ‘old school’ style of grinding for as long as you can, followed up by a long rest. His training is now more of a partnership between training and recovery by breaking it up into manageable bite-sized chunks.
“If you take a step with your right foot, you can’t take another step with your right foot before you take a step with your left. Training and recovery are a partnership.”
On June 26th, Connor secured his spot of the 2016 Team USA Swimming Roster where he will be competing in his second Olympic games. We wish him the best of luck and are proud to say he is a member of Team WHOOP.",7/30/16
swimming-the-distance-for-team-usa,Connor Jaeger's Heart Rate Monitor for Swimming: WHOOP,"In 2012, Connor got his first shot at the Olympics. “My intention was to represent Michigan well,” he said. In the final of the 1,500-meter freestyle, Connor placed sixth with a time of 14:52.99. This was an incredible feat considering he broke 15-minutes in his first international event, and was only a sophomore in college representing his country on the world stage.",7/30/16
swimming-the-distance-for-team-usa,Connor Jaeger's Heart Rate Monitor for Swimming: WHOOP,"One of the oldest debates in the scientific community is whether behavior is inherited or acquired. ‘Nature,’ is what we think of as pre-wiring and is influenced by genetic inheritance. ‘Nurture,” is generally thought of as the influence of external factors, such as the product of exposure, experience, and learning.
The sporting community is by no means immune to this debate, which creates some of the most polarizing opinions about what aspects play important roles in an athlete’s athletic evolution. I can understand why this resonates with people. It’s hard to deny that Ethiopian runners, who train in high altitude and heat, aren’t influenced by their surroundings. In addition, when looking at the Manning family, the argument of ‘nature’ understandably makes intuitive sense. The waters here can get quite murky.
Believe what you will, but Connor Jaeger, Team USA distance-swimming superstar, grew up in an aquatic household. His introduction to the water began at an abnormally young age, not because of his own interest, but rather his parents’ want for safety. In Fair Haven New Jersey, Connor and his sister were always at the beach – “surf rats” as he describes it. Since his love for the water started at an early age, his parents signed him up to swim at the Surfrider Beach Club in Seabright New Jersey. At the age of 6, Connor struggled to swim a full 25-yard lap (which he laughs at now). “The ‘big kids’ had to go in the middle and hold the noodle for us. This was my first experience with competitive swimming,” Jaeger mentioned. “Then somewhere along the lines, someone suggested to my parents that my older sister and I should try-out for a year-round team.” From there, swimming became ingrained in Connor and he seemed to naturally gravitate to his predisposed proclivity toward the water.",7/30/16
swimming-the-distance-for-team-usa,Connor Jaeger's Heart Rate Monitor for Swimming: WHOOP,"As Connor entered high school, he wasn’t quite sure if this sport was right for him. He said he seriously teetered on the fence about the sport. “There were times that I thought I wanted to quit, actually, it was all the time. But they were for dumb reasons,” he said. “So looking back at it, I’m obviously glad I stuck with it.” During Connor’s high school career, his approach to training strictly revolved around practice. As with many high school athletes, understanding that the nuances of training extend beyond the scope of practice is vital, but often lost.
Upon high school graduation, Connor became a member of the University of Michigan swim team where prestigious alumni like Michael Phelps and Tom Dolan had competed. This was the defining step in Connor’s career where his training and overall approach to swimming adapted. “In college, I became a 24-hour athlete. Everything that I was doing was all about how it was going to affect my next practice,” he said. “As I got to practice at 6am, I constantly thought about how my body would be prepared for my next practice.”
Connor’s typical training involved long strenuous practices of grueling aerobic workouts, early mornings, and self-induced sprints from class to class. “My hardest training days are Mondays. I wake up at 5:15am and swim 2 hours packed with kicking and aerobic drills. Since I was in college during most of my training I’d have to then rush to my 9am class. After class, we’d do long-rep threshold workouts of 800 meters where we would hold our fastest possible pace.”
In total, Connor swims 15-16 kilometers every Monday in addition to out-of-water exercises. This equates to 5 hours of training, on top of his coursework. Don’t forget that.",7/30/16
sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-systems-how-they-work,Sympathetic vs. Parasympathetic Nervous Systems: How They Work,"Parasympathetic Nervous System: Rest and Digest
The parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) works in opposition to the sympathetic system, controlling the body’s ability to relax. It mainly functions to downregulate the body using the vagus nerve, which sends impulses from the brain to the body and back. The PSNS works to tell your brain what’s happening within your body, instead of your brain telling your body what to do. It usually activates when you are feeling relaxed or in a mundane situation.
The PSNS slows your heart and respiratory rates, narrows pupils, and increases digestion. It’s called the “rest and digest” or “feed and breed” system as it conserves the body’s natural activities until after a stressful situation has passed. Once the danger is over, the PSNS returns the body to homeostasis.
The sympathetic and parasympathetic systems are parts of the autonomic nervous system and have opposing Effects on several systems.",2/1/22

WHOOP monitors your heart rate and calculates your HRV on a nightly basis using a dynamic average during sleep. It is weighted towards your last stage of slow wave sleep when you’re in your deepest period of sleep and your body is most at rest. An accurate understanding of your baseline HRV enables you to monitor how your parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems are performing.
You can view your daily HRV in the WHOOP app and track it over time using the Health Monitor.",2/1/22
sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-systems-how-they-work,Sympathetic vs. Parasympathetic Nervous Systems: How They Work,"The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is also called the involuntary nervous system. It regulates important bodily functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, temperature, pupil dilation, and digestion. The system allows us to react and adjust these functions without consciously thinking about them.
The ANS is further divided into two components: The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. These two systems work in conjunction to provide input to your body at all times, acting to decrease or increase activities.
In a healthy system, when it’s time to act or there is a perceived threat, the sympathetic will dominate, when there are no threats, the parasympathetic dominates.
## Sympathetic Nervous System: Fight or Flight
The ANS directs your body’s rapid and involuntary response to strain, such as danger, disease, and exercise. It sends messages to organs, muscles, and glands to increase heart rate, dilate the bronchial tubes to your lungs, increase perspiration, and cause pupil dilation.
This “fight or flight” response is an evolutionary survival mechanism, enabling humans and other mammals to react quickly to life-threatening situations such as an oncoming car or a buffalo speeding towards them. But your body may also react during non-life threatening stress too, like traffic jams, making a presentation at work, or family arguments.
While your body is busy responding to stressors, the SNS inhibits non-vital functions such as digestion and salivation to stop energy from going to those organs and focus it on saving your life or nailing that presentation.
The SNS does not calm you down after it’s wound you up though, that role is performed by the parasympathetic system.",2/1/22
sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-systems-how-they-work,Sympathetic vs. Parasympathetic Nervous Systems: How They Work,"Autonomic Nervous System and Heart Rate Variability
Heart rate variability (HRV) is a measure of how the SNS and PSNS affect your heart beat. When your nervous system is balanced, your heart is constantly being told to beat slower by your parasympathetic system, and to beat faster by your sympathetic system. These mixed messages result in a constant state of variation in your heart rate. HRV is the variance in time between beats.
For example, if your heart beat is 60 bpm, the time between beats is likely not exactly 1 second. It may be 0.9 seconds between two beats and 1.1 seconds between two others.
When you have high heart rate variability, it means that your body is responsive to input from both the SNS and PSNS. This is a sign that your nervous system is balanced, and that your body is capable of performing at its best.
Conversely, a low HRV means that one branch is dominating and sending stronger signals to your heart than the other. This may occur during a race for example, when the SNS is focused on allocating resources to your legs (sympathetic activity) as opposed to digesting food (parasympathetic activity). But it may also occur when you’re tired or sick, leaving fewer resources available for tasks like exercising or giving a work presentation.
Essentially, if one system is dominating, it means the SNS has less ability to take over when it needs to, such as when you’re facing down a bear.
HRV is a result of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems affecting your heart beat from second to second.",2/1/22

When busy days ensue, it’s possible that the sympathetic system is activated for the majority of the day. This leads to increased heart rate, potentially a racing mind, and a barrier to being present. To combat this, you can begin exploring tools to help shift the mind and body into what we call a coherent state.
Within a coherent state, our mind and body (breathing rhythm and heart rhythm) become in sync with one another. When this happens you give yourself the opportunity to be more present, to better balance and navigate emotions, and to slide back into a restful sleeping state.
I went through three different types of breathwork with my Sensei Mindset Guide Trevor Tellin, MA, including what he called “three little waves,” (three identical breaths in a row), heart-focused breathing (thinking of breath flowing directly in and out of the heart), and a moment of appreciation (imagine something you’re appreciative of and focus on that for the duration of the exercise).
“Just like with our fitness, you want to work smarter not harder with your breathwork,” says Tellin. “Different types of breathwork can impact different people differently. So really, it’s just understanding questions like how do I operate? What are my preferences? Then, once we kind of bring that to the surface, you can choose a technique that leverages different qualities.”
For me, for instance, I most resonated with the three little waves technique. The conscious, active breathing worked well for me as an analytical person with an active mind, and enabled me to get into that goal coherent state.

The concept: The smallest amount of an input required to achieve a desired outcome. Dr. Silvey explained to me that when you’re someone who trains regularly, a few weeks away from training won’t dramatically impact your progress for the worse. “The deload can feel frustrating, but backing off when you have an injury allows your body to heal,” he says. “Cardiovascular gains especially are lasting, so there are training residuals that stick.”

In my day-to-day diet, I’m a fruit fiend. Both fruits and vegetables provide a variety of vitamins and nutrients, and can even reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. While they’re certainly a healthier pick than some other processed alternatives, reaching for berries, apples, melons, and more regularly can result in a blood sugar spike (and then crash), especially post-sweat.
“Fruit is a carbohydrate, and a fast energy source,” says Sensei Nutrition Guide Lydia Moran, MS, PA. “When we consume fruit, the carbohydrates break down relatively quickly in our system, and then that raises your blood sugar. When your blood sugar goes up, the way that our body combats that is by releasing insulin from your pancreas.”
While you may want that quick fuel source before a run or high-intensity workout, it won’t be as beneficial on its own sans sweat. The goal: Pair fruits with a fat or protein (think all-natural nut butter or greek yogurt) to slow down that digestion, and you’ll lower any inevitable sugar spike. Plus, you’ll stay fuller for longer!

Again, I’m a huge vegetable fan. But, tweaking when we eat them can make a major difference in how your body digests and ultimately better your gut health, according to Moran.
The goal: Greens come first. Not only will this make sure that you get in the vegetables (as well as their essential vitamins and nutrients including fiber), but it can also keep your bowel movements more regular as a result.
This could be as simple as adding a small salad before dinner and lunch, and avoid going from 0 to 100. “The last thing you want to do is start loading up on plants and tons of beans out of nowhere, completely shocking your stomach,” says Moran. “Just like with any good habit, start small and work your way up so that you can upkeep a routine.”
## 5. BMI Is An Outdated Metric
As part of the testing, I did body composition and bone density testing that included a BMI readout. Before we even broached that topic, Silvey wanted me to know that for many athletes, “obese” as outlined by the U.S. Department of Health, is actually quite healthy. Active individuals have stronger bones and more-developed muscles, both of which weigh more than fat.
“BMI is a simple math formula, but it doesn’t take into account how much water or muscle mass is in the body, or sex or age for that matter,” says Silvey. “You’re better off working one-on-one with an expert, like a physician or a trainer, to get insight into where you are with your body.”

target-anaerobic-heart-rate-zone-benefits,Target the Anaerobic Heart Rate Zone: Benefits and Exercise,"9 Benefits of Anaerobic Exercise
Anaerobic training has been shown to have several physical and psychological benefits, including boosting your mood and reducing your risk of heart disease and diabetes.
Build muscle: The first benefit you may notice is larger muscles. Working your muscles causes small tears in the fibers that are reformed to build and strengthen them.
Support weight loss: Larger muscles need more calories to function. This means you’ll burn more calories even while resting. This metabolic boost may help you reduce body fat and lose weight.
Afterburn: Your body requires a lot of oxygen after an anaerobic workout. This deficit is called excess post-exercise oxygen consumption, aka the afterburn effect, which is the amount of oxygen needed to return the body to its resting state. Since you consume more oxygen during anaerobic sessions than you inhale, you’ll continue to burn more calories even after finishing an activity as you catch your breath.
Increase lactate threshold: Lactate or anaerobic threshold is the intensity of exercise at which lactate, or lactic acid, accumulates faster than it can be removed. Training in the anaerobic zone raises the lactate threshold by increasing the muscles’ alkaline reserves, allowing them to work in the presence of increased lactic acid. This means that as you continue working in this zone, you’ll be able to train for longer periods of time without suffering the effects of lactic acid buildup.
Fight depression: Any exercise can help boost mood and relieve anxiety. While it may not be enough to relieve all the symptoms of depression, high-intensity exercise releases endorphins, dopamine and serotonin, which can reduce depression symptoms.",8/2/21
target-anaerobic-heart-rate-zone-benefits,Target the Anaerobic Heart Rate Zone: Benefits and Exercise,"Anaerobic and Aerobic Heart Rate Zones
Your heart rate may be 20-30 BPM faster in the anaerobic zone than the aerobic zone. Since your body experiences these zones differently, your workouts should reflect that.
Your body also metabolizes energy differently in the anaerobic and aerobic heart rate zones. Aerobic means “needs oxygen” and aerobic workouts use oxygen as their main source of energy, while anaerobic (without oxygen) uses glucose for energy. . Workout length normally differs greatly between these two zones. Anaerobic activities are intense bursts of action that may only last for 90-120 seconds, while to take advantage of the aerobic heart rate zone you should try to stay in it for at least 40 minutes.
Training with both anaerobic and aerobic sessions will increase lean muscle mass and burn fat more quickly than one or the other. Monitoring your heart rate while exercising can help you maximize your workout, push you harder as you get used to routines, and ensure you stay within your intended heart rate zone. It can also help you avoid overtraining.
## Know Your Heart Rate Zone with WHOOP
By measuring your heart rate 24/7, WHOOP quantifies the strain your body takes on each day. Each morning, our recovery metric is calculated using heart rate variability, resting heart rate, respiratory rate and sleep, and tells you how prepared you are to take on strain.
When you monitor your activities with the WHOOP Strain Target you can see your heart rate in real time, as well as the percentage of your max heart rate, so you’ll know what zone you’re in and better understand when to pull back or push yourself harder. It also shows your strain building and lets you know if you’ve hit the desired amount.",8/2/21
target-anaerobic-heart-rate-zone-benefits,Target the Anaerobic Heart Rate Zone: Benefits and Exercise,"Getting the most out of every workout does not mean going at full speed until you collapse. Instead, it consists of planning workouts and targeting a specific heart rate to meet your goals. If your goal is to build muscle, targeting the anaerobic heart rate zone should be part of your exercise plan.
## What Is The Anaerobic Heart Rate Zone?
Anaerobic means “without oxygen.” It’s a heart rate between 80%-90% of your maximum heart rate. In this heart rate zone, your body can’t get enough oxygen to fuel muscles, so it turns to the glucose found in carbs. The body burns carbs quickly producing lactic acid, but it has a hard time clearing the lactic acid. You may feel your muscles ache during anaerobic routines as lactic acid builds up.
Anaerobic workouts like sprinting and weightlifting are more intense but generally shorter in duration than aerobic exercises. You use smaller muscle groups in this zone and usually focus on one muscle group at a time in each activity.",8/2/21
target-anaerobic-heart-rate-zone-benefits,Target the Anaerobic Heart Rate Zone: Benefits and Exercise,"Anaerobic Heart Rate Zones by Age
Your anaerobic heart rate zone is 80-90% of your max heart rate.
Your personal anaerobic heart rate zone is based on your max heart rate for your age. The first step is finding your max heart rate and a commonly used equation is subtracting your age from 220. By this method, the max HR for a 45-year-old is 175 beats per minute (BPM). However, this formula doesn’t consider your specific variables like gender, conditioning or genetics. Here are other formulas for finding your max heart rate.
Other factors that can affect heart rate include:
Emotions
Body temperature
Physical activity and strain
Hydration
Sleep
Menstrual cycle
Medication
Ambient temperature and humidity
Altitude
## Examples of Anaerobic Exercises
High-intensity short workouts that involve quick bursts of energy will raise your heart rate into the anaerobic zone. The goal is to maintain a heart rate between 80% and 90% of your max HR for 90-120 seconds. Anaerobic activities include:
Sprinting
Weightlifting and strength training
High intensity interval training (HIIT)
Jumping rope
Circuit training
Spin class
Body weight workouts
Chores such as heavy yardwork or gardening",8/2/21
tayler-wiles-fatigue-menstrual-cycles,"Tayler Wiles on Cycling, Cycles and Fatigue","Competition and Recovery Returning to Green
As an elite athlete self criticism can be hard to shut off, especially when you are in a phase of recovery. We always want to do more, be the best, and push the limits. Sometimes our bodies just finally say no. After a few days the red scores turned to yellow, then a few more days and those yellows turned green. On Day 5, my cycle started. It was the first time I’ve ever done a happy dance for the first day of my cycle, but I was just so thrilled to have a sign that my body was finally getting to a better place.
I did some short, sharp rides leading into the Giro to wake up my legs, and was incredibly relieved that the burning fatigue I’d felt for weeks prior was gone. In fact, on the morning the race began, I had a 98% recovery!
The Giro started with a bang and my team, Trek-Segafredo, had an incredible victory together in the Stage 1 Team Time Trial! Overall we had a very successful race, with my teammate Elisa Longo Borgini ending on the overall GC podium.
## Why WHOOP?
As female athletes we have to commit to tuning into our bodies and making sure we are doing everything possible to maintain a healthy cycle, in both our sporting careers and our daily lives. I find WHOOP to be an incredible tool to track my physiology. I’ve been able to trust the data and use it in such impactful ways.
Train hard, but be smart. Feel your sensations and make note of them. If you follow the trends without overthinking them, the direction they can give you is incredibly powerful.

Then it happened. My cycle became a week late, then two, then three. A trend from my past that I was not happy about repeating.
So, I decided to wake up and really listen to the red recoveries. I spoke with my coach and he agreed that I would take 5 full days off the bike. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic racing was all but canceled, and then suddenly brought back and condensed into an incredibly intense 3-month calendar.
Having all of these big races (and big opportunities) all smashed together and coming at me like a freight train made the thought of taking time off feel devastating. But, also not as devastating as the idea of continuing to be “running on empty” during every training session and race going forward.
With our only Grand Tour the Giro Rosa just around the corner, I was committed to doing whatever it took to find my legs again. So I put my faith in my WHOOP, touched base with Dr. Simms about my nutrition, and gave my body 5 days. I was diligent about my sleep, treatments, nutrition and also my mental state.",12/4/20
tayler-wiles-fatigue-menstrual-cycles,"Tayler Wiles on Cycling, Cycles and Fatigue","Throughout my career, I’ve become more diligent about tracking the good and bad days and the feelings and sensations that go along with them. At times I’ve found myself overthinking every ache, every muscle that’s slightly tight, and every grumble of my stomach.
Over the past few years I’ve discovered that monitoring what my body is telling me in a meaningful way has taught me so much about what gives me power, as well as what weaknesses I can work to correct.
Unlocking a lot of this began when I started using WHOOP in 2018. I was fascinated by the insights it revealed and what I could learn about my body from the data it provided on sleep, heart rate variability, resting heart rate, and more. I also love that it has a feature that allows you to track not only your daily habits, but the timing of your menstrual cycle as well.",12/4/20
tayler-wiles-fatigue-menstrual-cycles,"Tayler Wiles on Cycling, Cycles and Fatigue","Battling Fatigue
Unfortunately, I learned this year that nutrition is not the only factor that affects my cycle, fatigue does as well.
Earlier this season I found myself yet again with a disappearing cycle. This time my nutrition and weight were good, but my feelings during training and racing were not. After a hard block of training at altitude I began racing the following weeks, and I knew something was not right. I had an incredible feeling of fatigue in my legs during hard efforts–a burning sensation that was difficult to recover from after repeated efforts.
This was not the normal sensation of lactic acid build up that as athletes we are all too familiar with. It was as if my legs were on fire and completely empty. I had felt strong at altitude and my numbers in training were really solid, but suddenly I had an incredible sense of fatigue.
At first I thought it was just the need to recover from my time spent at altitude. I’d take a few days to rest, try to push again in training or a race, and boom–the feeling was still there. I started to be very vigilant about what I was eating to make sure I was getting what I needed. I also began paying extra attention to my WHOOP sleep stats, which were consistently pretty good.
However, there was one thing I could not ignore, the day-after-day red recovery scores from my WHOOP. These red recoveries were not just after hard workouts, races, or bad nights of sleep. They were popping up even after multiple days of recovery and nights of really solid sleep (like a 23% recovery on 7:49 sleep, followed by only a 32% recovery after 8:28 sleep). I just couldn’t shake them, nor could I shake the fatigue I was feeling day after day in training and racing.",12/4/20

My cycle has always been an area of immense frustration for me. Its timing has a big impact on my performance and I have frequently had trouble navigating it. As a female athlete in a sport where power-to-weight ratios are unfortunately a focus, I’ve experienced moments throughout my career when my cycle has disappeared completely–an all too often occurrence among female endurance athletes and one of the symptoms of RED-S (Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport).
With a disappearing cycle (or an incredibly inconstant one) it became nearly impossible to track and make the changes I needed to be my best physiologically during its various phases. I have been incredibly lucky to work directly with Dr. Stacy Sims, one of my all-time personal heroes, and a groundbreaking researcher who has literally written the book on how to navigate your cycle as a female athlete (it’s called ROAR).
Dr. Sims shared valuable knowledge as to what I was missing nutritionally, and after a period of time giving my body what it needed I was able to regain a consistent cycle. This consistency enabled me to have control again and I no longer felt powerless to my cycle.",12/4/20
tayler-wiles-giro-rosa,No Red Days: Tayler Wiles Races the Giro Rosa,"During the 10-day tour, you can see that her resting heart rate (RHR) gradually increased and her heart rate variability (HRV) gradually decreased. This was a natural progression, considering the repeated days of high strain she was putting on her body. Luckily, her training and fitness allowed her to keep going and avoid being in the red. Tayler regularly has a high HRV and a resting heart rate below 40.
Having her WHOOP data not only allowed Tayler to optimize her training prior to the tour; it helped keep her mentally balanced throughout. “[Cyclists] like numbers, data, and certainty,” she says. “I think it’s easier to rest when you have some solid data telling you the ‘why’ behind your fatigue.”

WHOOP friend and professional cyclist Tayler Wiles is no stranger to the grind. As the men’s tour winds its way through the Vuelta and Tour of Britain, we look back at Tayler’s time at the Giro Rosa, the crown jewel of the women’s calendar.
Part of the UCI Women’s World Tour, The Giro Rosa has been held for 30 years and traverses through the northern countryside of Italy. It consists of grueling hill climbs, long flat stages, and speedy time trials. Tayler currently rides for team Trek-Segafredo, a professional American UCI cycling team.
Below is a chart that outlines each stage, along with Tayler’s daily recovery, strain, and sleep metrics. Amazingly Tayler never spent a day in the red, which she credits towards her fitness and the resources available to her team on the tour.
“I found this year I recovered the best between stages because of my team. I’m lucky to be on one of the most well supported teams in women’s cycling,” she explains. “We had a doctor, physios, and osteos looking after us each day, and a staff that made all the transfer and travel incredibly easy and stress free. All of these things are so helpful when racing hard day after day. Every little bit counts.”
Also worth noting is the difficulty of Stage 5, Ponte in Valtellina to Lago di Cancano, a 54.4-mile leg with two major climbs and a hilltop finish. Tayler reached a 20.5 strain for the day, and subsequently woke up with the lowest recovery of her tour at 39%. That morning she pushed through a speedy, uphill individual time trial, where she finished 9th out of 144 riders.
As an elite cyclist, Tayler was primed for peak performance leading up to the Giro Rosa. This meant that her body was ready to endure several consecutive days of high strain, something she had practiced many times before during her training cycles.",9/17/19

Nate has done an exceptional job balancing his Strain and Recovery to this point (see below), but that will almost certainly change after Team Back Bay competes in three more events today.
Back Bay sits in 10th place overall at the moment, but has eyes on climbing the ranks. “The next workout is the 1RM Snatch and that will be a really good one for our team,” Kesley Kiel told us.
Team Back Bay competed in two events on Day 1 of the Games, the Bike Deadlift (1600-meter bike rides followed by team deadlifts of 800 pounds) and the 30s (muscle-ups, back squats, push presses and box jump-overs). Below is a graph of Nate McCabe‘s heart rate over the course of both events:
Nate logged a 10.6 Strain in 21 minutes during the Bike Deadlift, with an average heart rate of 154 beats per minute. He then posted a 9.8 Strain over 50 minutes of the 30s, with an average heart rate of 123 bpm. His hr peaked at 178 bpm right before finishing the second event. In total, Nate’s Day Strain was 17.2.
Yesterday’s Strain clearly took its toll on Nate and the rest of the squad. Despite sleeping 8:21 last night, he woke up this morning with only a 39% Recovery.
Similarly, Breezy Hamilton (16.0 Day Strain yesterday) slept 7:09 and was just 23% recovered. Overall, the team’s average Recovery today was 31%.
Luckily, Back Bay and others in the team competition have a day off to rest today before getting back at it tomorrow afternoon.
Below are the week-long data averages for each member of Team Back Bay heading into the Games:
The travel from Boston to Madison may well have impacted their Sleep, but the collective 61% Recovery for the past week is quite respectable.
This morning, Nate led the team with a 93% Recovery after getting 8:03 of Sleep last night. Kelsey also managed an 80% Recovery despite sleeping just 5:32.

After a 100% Sleep Performance of 8:31 on Wednesday night, Joe woke up Thanksgiving morning with a 98% Recovery, the highest on Team Thrive. However, his reign at the top was short lived.

“On Thanksgiving, a bartender friend of mine came over and made some exotic drinks for us,” Joe confessed. “They were something he invented with an infused vodka he’d been working on for the last few months. I can say with complete certainty that having more to drink than I normally do killed my Recovery. For a guy who usually sticks to just one, having three or four drinks definitely hit me hard.”

As we mentioned last week, Thanksgiving Day was an above average Strain day for Team Thrive. Eliot Pitney, a 38-year-old project manager from Yarmouth, ME, topped the leaderboard with a Day Strain of 19.0. For Eliot, it wasn’t holiday stresses or even a hard workout in the gym that elevated his Strain, he simply participated in one of his favorite hobbies–riding a fat bike. It also happened to be his means of transportation to Thanksgiving dinner.
“I am an avid road cyclist and I do a lot of competitive racing [Cat 1],” Eliot told us. “But I also really enjoy fat biking as a way to avoid burnout on the road. I just wanted to get outside, have a little fun on the bike and work up an appetite. There is a nice, local trail system about a mile-and-a-half from my house that runs out to Cousins Island. My Thanksgiving dinner happened to be on an adjacent island, so I ended up riding about 20 miles out and back, having a good time running through the mud and up over the rock walls. I rode until sundown, which always yields some spectacular views along the Maine coastline. I was quite hungry for our family Thanksgiving feast–success all around!”
Eliot’s Day Strain was all the more impressive considering he was only 35% Recovered that morning with less than six hours of Sleep:
“I’d just come off being ill and using NyQuil to help get some rest,” Eliot explained. “That Wednesday was the first night without the drugs, so on Thanksgiving I was awake a lot earlier than the previous mornings. I hadn’t exercised in four days and I was itching to get in some activity.

“I went to Lake Tahoe two weeks early to train, get focussed and get used to the elevation,” Hawley said. “I set up WHOOP and started using it the day I got there. Right off the bat, I thought the Sleep tracker was the coolest thing ever. I also loved how it calculated the Strain I put on my body through my workouts, it took things to a whole new level so I could analyze my intensity on a day-to-day basis. Additionally, Recovery had always been an issue for me. Normally, I would just train through however I was feeling. But in this case, I listened to what WHOOP told me to do with the Strain I was taking on and how much Sleep I needed to be Recovered the next day.”
Alyssa’s data over those two weeks reflects a near-perfect training plan:
She trained hard leading up to the World Championships, with a string of high-Strain days (above in blue). When her Recovery (red, yellow and green) dipped into the red as her race weekend approached, she began to cut back on her workload:
“On the Tuesday before the race, I started tapering my training and my Recovery went up and up,” Hawley said. “I was perfectly primed and ready to peak that Saturday morning. I’d trained smarter and more efficiently than I ever had before and I ended up taking 3rd place in the World Championships!”
“I really do owe a big thanks to WHOOP,” Alyssa continued. “It played a huge part in my training and Recovery up until race day. It blew my mind looking at the data afterwards. Then of course my Recovery dropped significantly after the races because of the high Strain. But I kept following the recommendations from WHOOP, and I was still able to run a PR in a marathon the next weekend.”
“I’ve been using WHOOP consistently ever since the world championships,” Hawley added. “I am so excited to take it into my 2018 training and racing season as my secret weapon!”

I used to track heart rate with my watch, but it really didn’t do much for me except make me aware of what zone I was running in. I tried monitoring my HRV [heart rate variability] for a bit, but I got annoyed with the chest strap. My watch could also track how long and far I ran, but then I literally had to just log it in a journal. Trying something like WHOOP was new territory for me and I was skeptical.”",12/15/17

“The big thing for me is accountability. Knowing my Strain each day and how it affects my Recovery is huge. I try to shift back and forth between high-intensity and low-intensity days, WHOOP helps me maximize that. You spend three months training for 15 minutes in the ring, so you want to make sure you get it right.”
Last week, Holtzman shared this screenshot in his Instagram story, proudly showing off his place at No. 1 on Team Thrive’s Day Strain rankings:
You can see he logged three activities that day, Martial Arts, Boxing and CrossFit. “On high-Strain days, three workouts is the norm,” Scott said. “I usually do conditioning of some kind, boxing and either kickboxing or wrestling.”
We asked Scott about the pressure he has to deal with when months of hard work all come down to his performance on one single night. How does he handle it?
“It definitely can be a challenge mentally,” he said. “I just try to prepare myself with positive reinforcement. I know I’ve put in the time and effort to be at my best and I have the data to back it up.”",12/6/17

technology-improvements-whoop-strap-3-0-hardware,Technology Improvements in the WHOOP Strap 3.0,"Here at WHOOP, we’re very excited to have just released the WHOOP Strap 3.0 (“Gen 3”). Our entire team has been hard at work for over a year, learning from customer feedback and research and development to bring you a significantly more advanced product. I’d like to share a behind the scenes look at how we developed the technology, as well as give more details into some of the improvements we’ve made and what that means for your experience using WHOOP.
Gen 3’s electronics have been completely redesigned and upgraded from Gen 2. We learned a lot from the Gen 2’s out in the wild and from our members’ feedback about its performance. We discovered the biggest issues with the Gen 2 experience were the device’s battery life, and some band material not consistently holding the sensor securely in place.",5/30/19
technology-improvements-whoop-strap-3-0-hardware,Technology Improvements in the WHOOP Strap 3.0,"New Bands
To solve the issues some users had with band slippage (which in turn diminishes data accuracy), we sought to engineer a new type of band, custom made for WHOOP, that would fit our users comfortably and securely during all of their activities. The new ProKnit band features no-slip, quick-absorption and quick-dry properties. It’s also slightly stretchy, yet firm enough to hold the Strap securely in place. We’re very excited to have our users try the new ProKnit bands, they feel incredible on the wrist and function phenomenally!
## Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
Beyond allowing us to significantly increase the battery life, BLE also gives us a more developer-friendly protocol with smartphones. The WHOOP App is now able to have much more control over the Strap and users will experience a more seamless pairing process.
BLE also enables several new app features, including the Strain Target, WHOOP Live and Heart Rate Broadcast. For more on these features, check out our overview of the WHOOP Strap 3.0 and our recent podcast with CEO Will Ahmed.
## Continuous Improvements
Just like our members, we are constantly hard at work using data to improve performance! This launch is just the start for Gen 3. We will continue to develop new features, data insights, and soft goods to enhance your WHOOP experience.
Stay tuned!",5/30/19
technology-improvements-whoop-strap-3-0-hardware,Technology Improvements in the WHOOP Strap 3.0,"WHOOP Strap 3.0 Hardware
To improve the battery life, we took a look at all of the ways the Gen 2 uses power. We decided the best course of action was to move the signal processing (which takes the sensor data and converts it into a heart rate) from the mobile applications to the Strap itself. By keeping the computations local to the Strap, we were able to gain several huge advantages.
First, we no longer needed to transfer tremendous amounts of raw data to another device over Bluetooth. This enabled us to use the much more power efficient and lower bandwidth Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Additionally, we didn’t have to worry about the occasional Bluetooth packet (bundles of information) loss that occurs when trying to transfer data from the Strap to the phone, which would cause retries in transmission or signal interruptions in our processing algorithms.
A WHOOP hardware engineer in action.
Porting the algorithm to the Strap was no easy feat–mobile devices have significantly more computational resources available to make it happen. But after months and months of effort we were able to get the algorithm to successfully run on the Strap itself, and in an acceptable time frame.
In addition to moving the algorithm, we undertook an extensive rebuild of the electronics as well. Gen 3 includes newer and more power-efficient components, like the microcontroller (similar in function to your computer’s processor) and accelerometer.
The combination of all of these things allowed us to increase the battery life from just under two days for Gen 2, to five days for Gen 3.
The mechanical structure of Gen 3 has also been upgraded. The casing and band attachment buckle have been strengthened, which will improve the physical durability of the Strap. Various other enhancements have also been made to enable a better manufacturing process for the Gen 3.",5/30/19
ted-king-cyclist-gravel-racing,How WHOOP Makes Me a Better Cyclist (Without Being a Pro),"The sport of cycling is steeped in tradition. For example, it’s rumored that mushrooms are little caloric furnaces and you’ll quickly shed weight by adding them to your meals. And while shaved legs are the norm, it’s suggested to not reach for the razor the day before a race because that causes microscopic damage which saps valuable energy from your body that would otherwise be put towards competition.
The stories passed down through generations will make you laugh, or just scratch your head.
## Marginal Gains
One of the most hot-button cycling terms over the past decade is “marginal gains.” Riders spend enormous resources to shave fractions of a second off their time in the wind tunnel, they go to great lengths to find the fastest clothing material or the speediest sock height, and they break valuable sponsor obligations to use the most aerodynamically slippery equipment.
I raced professionally for 10 years, from 2006 through 2015. I tackled the world’s biggest races from the Tour de France to the Giro d’Italia, the hallowed northern classics, and the world championships.
Half a dozen years prior, I got into cycling for the simple sake of fun. Sure, it became therapeutic – it was my recreation and motivation, it was my friend group and as competitive as I wanted – but fun was at the foundation.
Moving up through the ranks from amateur to high-level professional, like any sport it takes on a much more serious tone. So long as there’s a bottom line or money being exchanged, it seems there are never-ending lengths to be taken to be better.
My time in professional cycling saw the creation of the mighty Team Sky, the New York Yankees of bike racing with their bottomless budget and knack to win. Moreover, they were the first cycling team that really capitalized on marginal gains while others were still steeped in tradition.",5/21/21
ted-king-cyclist-gravel-racing,How WHOOP Makes Me a Better Cyclist (Without Being a Pro),"WHOOP, Micro and Macro
Without question, I would have been a better professional cyclist had WHOOP been available a decade prior during my career. The hyper acute side of professional cycling now capitalizes on marginal gains–the micro.
Meanwhile WHOOP also points out the macro gains to which we are otherwise blind. Now as I’m up to my eyes in family life, parenting, owning a business, coaching, and lots of time riding and racing my gravel bike, I use my WHOOP every single day so that I’m still up to perform the best I can.
Let’s take a busy April 27 for example. We’re lucky that our one-year-old daughter sleeps well, so recognizing the value of quality sleep for Mom and Dad means we try to log a lot too. I recorded a 100% sleep performance (9:04 in bed resulting in 8:19 sleep) the night prior giving me a 78% recovery going into the day.
A 100% sleep performance and a green WHOOP recovery leading into a very busy day.
While I’m a firm believer in the expression green means go, I also had a wildly busy day behind a computer screen, so I wasn’t able to get out until late in the day. Just before 3pm, I logged a quick hard outdoor riding session where I attempted a KOM (an acronym for “King of the Mountain,” which represents the fastest known recorded time on a particular, popular segment of road) and landed a decent third–coincidentally behind two other former World Tour professionals (13.0 strain).
Next, with an emphasis on efficiency, I hopped aboard my trainer and did some high intensity training in the indoor pain cave (13.6 strain). After that, I took advantage of some spectacular spring weather by loading up our daughter and riding to Taco Tuesday with my wife and some friends (5.9 strain), making it three bike sessions in the course of four hours, culminating in a hefty 18.2 day stain.

ted-king-cyclist-gravel-racing,How WHOOP Makes Me a Better Cyclist (Without Being a Pro),"My “Retirement” From Pro Cycling
Fast-forward to 2016 and my first year of “retirement.” I was 32 years old – not old, but certainly not young for the sport – and I consciously chose to step away for a variety of reasons, but right up at the top was that I still loved cycling and I didn’t want that to change. I could see it getting ever more acute, more sacrifices needing to be made, and to what end. I’d seen friends and former teammates end their careers and spitefully never ride a bike again. I didn’t want that to be me.
Cycling can become robotic as it rewards a powerful strength-to-weight ratio, so there’s a forever chase to be leaner. Eating disorders are common, especially on traditional teams. It was only towards the end of my time in cycling that sports nutritionists were suggesting to fuel amply with a variety of healthful foods rather than just mountains of pasta.
Please let me make a confession: I love beer. I also love food. As much as I embraced the process, trained and worked hard to earn that sinewy 5% body fat, I came to a point that I’d achieved everything I wanted in European cycling, and frankly I wanted to start enjoying life more and enjoying time on my bike again.
Unlike football which fans watch on TV once per week, one of the coolest aspects of cycling is its tangibility. Anyone with a bike can ride the same climbs or join pros on training rides… for as long as they can hang on! For all the good that NFL and NBA stars provide, I’m not aware of their daily public workouts and shoot-arounds.",5/21/21
ted-king-cyclist-gravel-racing,How WHOOP Makes Me a Better Cyclist (Without Being a Pro),"Following that jam-packed afternoon, in addition to a couple cervezas, it’s no surprise that the next day I wasn’t deep in the green, but only 51% recovered.
That’s what I value so highly about WHOOP for everyone, from top-tier pros to fledgling amateurs–it learns you and teaches you where to optimize. Amid the busy life of a World Tour cyclist, we move overseas to train and race, and in doing so, forego birthdays, weddings, and celebrations of all kinds.
So, back to a normal reality where I can enjoy these occasions, on Friday afternoon, April 9, we headed off to a friend’s outdoor birthday get-together. It was terrifically fun, the afternoon ran into the evening later than expected and the libations were plentiful. I knew I had a group ride planned very early the next day and was expecting to be deep in the red and not feeling my best on Saturday morning when the 4:30 am alarm went off.
To my surprise, however, I registered a 91% recovery.

Deciding to believe my WHOOP over how I thought I should feel, I was able to go out and really turn the screws to the group, and even set some PRs along the way. The data insights enabled me to push myself and perform at my best when my instincts would’ve told me otherwise.
For me, it’s among the masses that WHOOP returns the highest value because amateur athletes and everyday go-getters are not hellbent on earning those microscopic, marginal gains. Instead we can look for the macro – the big differences to be made – to make you a better you.",5/21/21
ted-king-cyclist-gravel-racing,How WHOOP Makes Me a Better Cyclist (Without Being a Pro),"Gravel Racing
Furthermore, enter the booming aspect of gravel cycling which is a recent and wildly popular side of the sport. Gravel is incredibly tangible and is purposefully catered to the masses. If you want to hammer and race, there’s room for that, and if you’re entirely new to riding a bike, you’re eagerly welcomed to the sport too–and certainly won’t be the only one in those (cycling) shoes.
Safely away from cars and traffic, it’s about getting down and dirty, but having a really good time. And most notably, you wrap up events or with a beer or tasty meal, rehashing the day’s adventure with your friends and cycling community.
In short, gravel is fun. And with an ever-growing list of things that I was missing while racing and living a life of austerity, the timing at which I chose to step away from World Tour racing was perfect because I could embrace this nascent sport of gravel starting in 2016. Gravel is all about the fun, the beer, the food, the friends, the community.",5/21/21

After a predictable dip in heart rate variability when the race began (from 103 to 68 to 33), Ted’s HRV actually rose significantly towards the finish. In his words, “From what I gather, that’s the chronic effect of being at that high-endurance limit for days on end. I’m not recovered, I’m so completely smashed, my heart just found a new level of always being sluggish.”
Per our VP of Data Science and Research Emily Capodilupo, “That can happen in those types of situations, your sympathetic system crashes so you get high HRV for the ‘wrong’ reason.”
Following a 6-hour sleep on what Ted thought would be his final night of the race, his last day of riding proved more difficult than expected. Knowing he wanted to break the record, he pushed on, “all day Wednesday into the wee hours Thursday morning. I took a pair of 15-minute naps in the final 4 hours, basically I just pulled off the road for a quick micro recharge.”

“I still don’t have much feeling in my fingers and very limited strength in my hands, which is as frustrating as it is scary. I’m working with some physical therapists and medical professionals to crack that code, but it seems that this is fairly standard in bikepacking,” Ted noted almost a week after the race concluded. Not from the cold specifically, but from “pinched, aggravated nerves after being on the bike for so long.”
Two weeks afterwards, his recoveries still hadn’t returned to normal. “Even with relatively low exertion the past 10 days, I’m still in the yellow and red,” Ted pointed out. “A sign that I’m still destroyed from what I put my body through.”
Also worth mentioning, Ted’s in-race fueling probably didn’t do much for his long-term recovery. Given the nature of the race, his body needed quick bursts of energy however it could get them. Notable items included Reese’s Pieces, diner eggs and hashbrowns, a Quarter Pounder with cheese and Werther’s Original candies.
“You’re not really eating the right food when you’re getting it at a gas station,” he joked.

Simply put, bikepacking is what you get when you combine long-distance cycling (on or off road) with camping. “You have to be completely self-sufficient in the middle of nowhere,” Ted explained, and have everything you need for the race with you on the bike.
“It took a lot of homework,” he added, noting the time he spent researching on Google Maps and making phone calls to find out where along the way he could eat, sleep and grab an occasional shower. “It’s not necessarily the most hygienic thing, because you’re carrying as little as possible and you don’t have a change of clothes.” Over the course of the 4+ nights he was racing, Ted slept briefly in a hotel, a community center, and various places along the side of the road.
“One night I was just so exhausted that I pulled over on a dirt road in the middle of the woods, set up a bivy sleeping bag and slept right there,” he said. “It got super cold at night, dropping down from the 30s to the high 20s. In my bag I had a down jacket, winter hat and a camping stove. Not everybody carries a stove, it’s an extra pound-and-a-half, but a friend of mine who does these races a lot told me ‘The one thing you want in the morning is a hot cup of coffee.’ He’s right, but unfortunately I woke up so cold I had to get moving right away, I didn’t have time to stand around and make coffee.”",11/23/20
ted-king-data-1000-mile-bikepack-race,"Physiological Data of Winning a 1,000-Mile Bikepack Race in Under 5 Days","How Much to Sleep?
The Arkansas High Country Race doesn’t have stages–there are no daily starts and stops as Ted was accustomed to from his pro career competing in the world’s top events like the Tour de France or Giro d’Italia. Every minute spent off the bike is one more minute delaying you from crossing the finish line.
Since this was Ted’s first venture into the sport of bikepack racing, he was unsure how to best manage his time. “That’s what showed my novice card,” he said. “You’re going to cover more distance moving than you are sleeping, and it’s your own personal algorithm on how little sleep you can actually operate on.” For Ted, that was an average of about 3.5 hours per night.

## Strain and Heart Rate Data
It’s one thing to try to get by on just a small percentage of the sleep you need for 5 straight nights, but an entirely different obstacle to simultaneously push your body to the max every day as well. Ted’s WHOOP strain (a measure of cardiovascular exertion on a scale of 0-21) exceeded 20 each day of the race, including 4 consecutive 20.7s.
After riding 240 miles and posting a 20.7 strain on the first day, Ted slept just 3:49 and awoke Sunday with a 10% recovery (how prepared your body is to perform, from 0-100%). “A shock to my system,” he called it. Following a second 20.7 day strain and another sub-4-hour sleep, he was actually 44% recovered on Monday, saying “My body had already started to adjust to sustaining that output.”
Below is Ted’s heart rate data for the third day of the race, “Fairly par for the course,” he called it. “Sleep very little (3:37 and only 33% of sleep need), wake up and ride with sporadic breaks to stop, refuel, stretch and continue on my merry way.” You can see his HR rarely dips below 120 for roughly 16 straight hours.",11/23/20

In order to accomplish this feat, he spent 17-20 hours per day on the bike, and only slept for a total of 17 hours. Why?
“I’d never done anything like this before,” Ted said. “The opportunity to try a whole new challenge, and to do so safely – given the inherent socially distanced nature of bikepacking – was something that really made me excited.” Initially his goal was just to “finish and survive,” but as the race progressed he realized that victory (and beating a record set by a duo, no less) was well within his reach.",11/23/20
the-advantage-of-continuous-physiological-monitoring,The Advantages of Continuous Physiological Monitoring,"The WHOOP monitoring platform continuously measures physiological strain and the body’s response to that strain to provide personalized training recommendations based on an individual’s response to various loads. The ability to action continuous data by applying it to dynamic training recommendations is a unique feature of the WHOOP system, and is primarily made possible by the proprietary “Day Strain” algorithm. Day Strain is a measure of user-normalized total cardiovascular load that jointly accounts for both obvious (example: from workouts) and non-obvious (example: from emotional stressors and activities of daily life) inputs. Day Strain therefore allows WHOOP to quantify the effects of down time, something not possible in cases of fitness tracking wearables designed to be removed after exercise.
The first section of this report provides a detailed explanation of the WHOOP Day Strain feature. The remainder of the report then demonstrates the significance of non-workout strain both by illustrating the magnitude of the cardiovascular load accrued outside the workout and by demonstrating the practical significance of this additional information by analysis of the predictive power of Day Strain as compared to the predictive power of workout Strain alone for key recovery metrics such as next-day resting heart rate and heart rate variability.

the-cto,The CTO and the Analysis of the Human Body,"In school, I was involved with astrophysics research projects where we would analyze large amounts of data. Because this data came from simulations or powerful telescopes, we had a seemingly endless amount of data. In contrast to astrophysics data, human physiology data is strikingly different; most studies are done on very small sample sizes over a short period of time. Meaningful conclusions are still drawn but a lot is left unknown, uninvestigated, or uncertain because of the lack of huge data sets.
After meeting Will and exploring this field of human physiology, I knew that WHOOP would be able to provide much-needed missing data that would be able to truly propel knowledge in this field. Right now the WHOOP strap measures physiological data through 5 individual sensors, each collecting 100 data points a second. With all this data, just imagine when there are are thousands or hundreds of thousands of WHOOP straps on elite athletes all across the world having their training and recovery data recorded and analyzed. There is no doubt that the insights we could get from this data would revolutionize how we approach the athlete’s performance; and that’s exactly our mission at WHOOP.
With an astrophysics-sized data set, we can now address questions like:
– Is it better, for me as an individual, to work out in the morning than if I just work out before bed?
– How should I schedule my workouts around game days so I perform optimally?
– How much sleep do I need tonight to be in peak shape for tomorrow?
– As a coach, how is my team’s recovery patterns different from last season?
– How should I alter the training regimen to account for this so we can outperform last season?",7/24/16

It is no doubt that these questions are just the tip of the iceberg. As we collect more and more physiological data about a person as well as aggregate at the team level and beyond to general demographics, we will unlock key insights into how the body responds to training stimulus and recovers to prepare for new, more advanced stimulus.

You will become a better athlete when you decide that rest is as important as exercise. That’s a secret that athletes like LeBron James and Tom Brady have known and acted on. The key is to understand your body continuously – 24/7.
When I was a college athlete I struggled with recovery and sleep. Like many athletes, I believed I could just keep pushing. I overtrained every season. My body couldn’t keep up with its stresses and my relentless mindset.
We founded WHOOP with a simple mission: To optimize human performance. What does it take to unlock peak performance?…For athletes? …For humans?
As a student at Harvard, I became obsessed with the concept of understanding the body. Athletes, myself included, were overtraining, undertraining, misinterpreting fitness peaks, not necessarily understanding the importance of recovery or sleep, and getting injured. With so much time, energy, and money dedicated to sports and training, why did we know so little about the human body?
I met with cardiologists and physiologists. I read over 300 medical papers. I became obsessed. What I discovered was amazing: There are secrets that your body – your physiology – is trying to tell you. These secrets can help prevent overtraining and injury, they can detect fatigue and even sickness, and, sure enough, they can be used to optimize human performance. But until now, no one could monitor those metrics.
I partnered with my co-founders John Capodilupo, who was studying the hardest math classes at Harvard before dropping out to found WHOOP, and Aurelian Nicolae, a graduate from Harvard with a gift for mechanical prototyping and engineering. We spent the last 4 years building our technology, the WHOOP System. We assembled a world-class advisory board and we’re proud to work alongside 50 brilliant engineers, designers, and data scientists.",7/29/16
the-effect-being-a-new-mom-has-on-your-sleep,The Effect Being a New Mom Has on Your Sleep,"It’s amazing what the human body can accomplish when it needs to. Out of sheer love and devotion for our son, Mollie functioned spectacularly as a new mother despite massive sleep deprivation for the next several days. Take a look at her data from the morning of Monday, April 3, when Rogan was eight days old:
With a new baby who wants to eat every two hours, it’s basically impossible for a breastfeeding mother to sleep for more than a couple hours at a time.
Even a full week after we left the hospital, very little had changed. Here’s Mollie’s Sleep from Thursday, April 6:
As the days went by, she was able to adapt. Sleeping for 1-2 hours at a time on several different occasions over the course of a 24-hour period (including a nap or two while the baby slept during daylight hours) may not be what our bodies are used to, but she made it work. And little by little, he began to sleep longer and longer each evening.
As we celebrate our first Mother’s Day as a family this weekend, everybody’s doing great. I’m happy to say that for the past few nights, Rogan has slept for 6-7 hours straight, allowing his mom to do the same for the first time in nearly two months–she’s definitely earned it:
However, despite the solid amount of rest pictured above (from Wednesday, May 10), Mollie still only managed 17 minutes of Deep Sleep:
I’m guessing it may be a while before her concern and adoration for our precious baby boy will allow her to truly get a good night’s sleep. Years from now when we tell him about the sacrifices his mother made for our family, we’ll have the data to prove it.",5/12/17
the-effect-being-a-new-mom-has-on-your-sleep,The Effect Being a New Mom Has on Your Sleep,"Ten months ago, my wife Mollie and I were thrilled to discover that she was pregnant and we’d be welcoming our first child into the world. The two of us were living in a tiny one-bedroom apartment in South Boston and I was a part-time blogger and freelance sportswriter. It was not the ideal situation for starting a family, so we made some changes. We bought a house in the suburbs and I started working at WHOOP.
In December, Mollie had the opportunity to meet my co-workers for the first time at our company holiday party. I knew she’d be great there–she has an amazing ability to engage anyone she meets in captivating conversation.
Midway through the evening, we found ourselves at a table with VP of Product Management, Joseph Gracia, and CEO, Will Ahmed. If Mollie was the least bit intimidated (I certainly was), she didn’t show it. Since she was five months pregnant, our future child was naturally a topic of conversation. Eventually the question was posed, “What if she wore a WHOOP Strap for the remainder of her pregnancy and during childbirth?”
The writer in me jumped at the idea, as did the data junkies at WHOOP. What could we learn from the experience? How high might her heart rate go while having a baby? What would her Strain look like compared to other activities WHOOP usually measures? And what would her Recovery be after giving birth?
With a little prodding, Mollie agreed to be our test subject. We outfitted her with a Strap and the story of the first WHOOP baby was officially underway.
March 23, a week before her due date, Mollie’s WHOOP data was looking good:",5/12/17
the-effect-being-a-new-mom-has-on-your-sleep,The Effect Being a New Mom Has on Your Sleep,"Unfortunately when the big day came, not everything went exactly as planned. Our son Rogan didn’t want to come out and Mollie had an unexpected C-section. After spending the previous two nights in the hospital (Mollie in a bed and me in the fold-out chair next to it) with a constant flow of doctors and nurses in and out of the room at all hours, neither of us was very well Recovered–64% for me, and only 28% for Mollie. On what would be our first day as new parents, we certainly were not primed for peak performance as far as childcare goes.
Mollie’s heart rate at the time of Rogan’s birth, 10:19 am on March 26, was a very mellow and drug-induced 72 beats per minute. Per my own WHOOP data, I was surprisingly calm as well, with a heart rate of 65 bpm. The same can’t be said for earlier that morning though, when at 9:08 am I was awakened by a nurse handing me a set of hospital scrubs and saying “put these on, you’re going to have a baby now” (136 bpm). Mollie’s heart rate peaked shortly after at 9:48 am (126 bpm), when she broke the news to her mother just before going into surgery.
Things went smoothly from there and we stayed in the hospital for four more days as Mollie recovered from surgery and our son got acclimated to being a living and breathing human being. Between Rogan’s unawareness of night and day and total disregard for the standard sleeping patterns that usually accompany it, and the continuous flow of medical professionals constantly checking on both him and Mollie, her daily WHOOP Recoveries never rose above 50%.
On our first night out of the hospital, we were finally treated to some peace and quiet in our own home. However, we were also now solely responsible for the health and well being of our little nugget. While I can’t say for certain if Mollie actually sat up and watched him breath all night (since I managed to zonk out for 6 hours and 54 minutes), WHOOP never detected her sleeping.",5/12/17
the-first-ever-company-wide-hack-day,"The First Ever Company-Wide ""Hack Day"" Improves the Wireless Heart Monitor","As late afternoon came, it was clear that we were going to deliver amazing demos. Teams were advised to follow the “80/20” rule here–work to get something 80% there visually and 20% scripted or “hard-coded.” It’s much more important that the idea is communicated in a tangible way, rather than having a full-fledged, bug-free product.
Demo Day was a chance to show folks what was explored, whether successful or not. Even if an idea didn’t come to fruition, it was very much encouraged to present the lessons learned and how we can become stronger from it. Each demo consisted of a five-minute explanation of what was accomplished in just a single day dedicated to the project. The highlights included:
After the demos we held a secret-ballot vote, with each person in the company asked to choose which hack they thought was the most inspirational. When the votes were counted, the winner was the GPS App Integration team, given their amazing ability to paint a picture of how athletes can learn so much more with an abundance of GPS data. Each member of the team received an engraved award commemorating the inaugural WHOOP Hack Day champions.
I’m so happy to have experienced this event with such talented and driven colleagues. Some of these projects are now being added to our development roadmap. Others are influencing the designs of items currently in the works. Turning dreams into reality is what made the first WHOOP Hack Day so magical.",5/22/17
the-first-ever-company-wide-hack-day,"The First Ever Company-Wide ""Hack Day"" Improves the Wireless Heart Monitor","Have you ever thought of an idea and never had a chance to see it through? At WHOOP, we just celebrated our first Hack Day–where everyone had the freedom to express their thoughts and make it happen.
If you’re not familiar with the term “Hack Day” (or what other companies call “hackathons”), the concept is fairly simple. In the spirit of innovation, employees take a break from what they normally do and focus on whatever they like. They’re given the opportunity to try and answer a simple question, “What’s something you wish WHOOP had?” Or more specifically, “What’s a new feature we could add that WHOOP users might thoroughly enjoy?” Now let’s take a day and see if it’s feasible.
Before the first WHOOP Hack Day, we had a Pitch Evening where those with visions could present their ideas in order to recruit others to help on their projects. We capped each pitch to three minutes.
After the pitches concluded, something special happened. There was buzz in the air. People immediately started bouncing concepts back and forth and refining ideas. Pitchers were able to solidify their ideas, and with help from the rest of the company, Hack Day was officially underway.
The Hack Day consisted of one official business day to work on what was pitched. Although there were a few solo projects, most people formed teams to make their ideas come true. It was extremely important that the hackers did the necessary preparation work–such as setting up GitHub (a developmental platform to build projects in) or finding the resources to really hit the ground running.
As soon as the teams came into the office that morning, they all found areas where they could work together heads down. They huddled in the kitchen with laptops, covered desks with hardware, and plastered meeting-room walls with drawings.",5/22/17
the-four-day-hangover-hrv-alcohol,The Four-Day Hangover,"Most athletes know better than to go out drinking the night before competition, but many wouldn’t think twice before knocking back some casual beers three days out. After all, come game time, BACs are long since back to zero and the typical hangover is a distant, albeit unpleasant, memory – evidence that the effects of drinking alcohol are behind us, right?
While we hate to be the bearers of bad news, in a data analysis conducted by WHOOP, the effects of alcohol were shown to last as long as four days in some collegiate athletes.",10/21/16
the-four-day-hangover-hrv-alcohol,The Four-Day Hangover,"Measuring the Effects of Alcohol
At this point, it is worth pointing out that the WHOOP analysis was done using preexisting data, and was not anticipated at the time of collection. Therefore, it was not possible to collect information on what, how much, or over what time period the participants drank. This means we are very likely lumping together athletes who had two beers or a glass of wine at dinner (while also drinking water and eating food) with athletes binge-drinking at a party. This is expected to explain some of variability in the duration of the effect on performance, but individual differences in physiology are also likely playing a significant role.
That said, here’s what we saw – the effects of alcohol were measured in two ways. The first was through objective recovery metrics – namely, resting heart rate and heart rate variability relative to each athlete’s season average. Measured this way, athletes exhibited sustained effects for anywhere from one to five days, with drop off as follows:
Athletes showed reduced recovery metrics for up to 4-5 days post alcohol consumption.
The second measurement of alcohol’s sustained effects was a subjective assessment. Through the WHOOP mobile app, athletes are surveyed on their perceived performance of each workout using a simple five-point scale. On average, athletes rate their performance at 3.3. On the first three days after a night of drinking, the average workout was self-rated significantly below this average level.",10/21/16
the-four-day-hangover-hrv-alcohol,The Four-Day Hangover,"Student-Athlete Alcohol Data Analysis
Our analysis used 148 student-athletes during the 2015-2016 athletic and academic year. These athletes represented 11 teams across 6 sports. While athletes were never instructed to drink, many chose to do so and volunteered this information the following morning in the WHOOP journal. While they slept off their debaucherous nights, WHOOP monitored their heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV). Not surprisingly, when compared to their non-drinking teammates, these key performance stats were far less impressive in the drinkers. Specifically, resting heart rates were 16.2% higher and HRVs were 22.7% lower – a change of similar magnitude to that of aging 12 years.
These results were not all that surprising, alcohol consumption has been repeatedly shown to tank athletic performance in studies measuring performance through endurance, strength, and fine motor skill assessments.
Interestingly, all these studies looked at acute effects, meaning performance was assessed within 24 hours of the alcohol consumption, and none reported on the duration of these effects.
That’s what makes the analysis conducted by WHOOP unique; because it’s worn 24/7, our subjects not only had resting heart rate and HRV data on the night following their drinking, but also on the five nights after that. Furthermore, WHOOP collected workout performance data on all workouts logged by these athletes following each drinking event. They were therefore able to answer, for the first time, the question: How long after you stop drinking is performance impaired?",10/21/16
the-four-day-hangover-hrv-alcohol,The Four-Day Hangover,"WHOOP Helps You Understand How Alcohol Affects Recovery
Together, the patterns in the subjective and objective measurements of post-alcohol recovery and athletic performance are the first to illustrate alcohol’s multi-day effects. While likely not what we wanted to hear, our results suggest that athletes may want to think twice before drinking the Wednesday before a Saturday game.
In an interview with Amanda Sobhy, the world No. 6 ranked female squash player and WHOOP user who was not a part of the study, Sobhy expressed being shocked to see how significant the impact of alcohol was on her own squash performance, telling us “I now limit myself a lot now. I used to drink before WHOOP and thought that it was just fine! Now I see the numbers and I’m like ‘Gosh, it’s destroying my life!’ My HRV is so low and my [resting heart rate] is so high, and I’m like HOLY MOLEY.”

the-impact-of-night-call-do-doctors-need-whoop,The Impact of Night Call: Do Doctors Need WHOOP?,"Rather than establish a seemingly arbitrary cut off for the amount of time a medical resident can be on the job, medical institutions should consider the individual impact of prolonged work shifts and how this affects their recovery. It seems clear that physicians aren’t monitored closely enough to know, with a level of confidence, their physiological readiness to perform on the job. Patients, residents, and hospitals alike are better protected from risk when care schedules are informed by data.
RELATED: What WHOOP Can Tell You About Flying a Red Eye",4/7/17
the-impact-of-night-call-do-doctors-need-whoop,The Impact of Night Call: Do Doctors Need WHOOP?,"A study published by the New England Journal of Medicine in August 2015 sought to determine the outcome of daytime medical procedures performed by surgeons who had worked the proceeding night shift. The study paired the data from 40,000 patients, looking at the outcomes of procedures conducted when the doctor had been on night-call and when they had not. The researchers found that when comparing the night-call group with the non–night-call group, there was no significant difference in the rates of death, readmission, or complications within 30 days of surgery. As such, this study would suggest that restrictions on prolonged shift work do not, in fact, affect health outcomes for patients.
Conversely, a literature review released in March 2015 with that same research question found significant evidence to suggest that sleep deprivation and prolonged shift work had adverse effects on physicians and their patients. The study documented 149 residents from 5 US academic medical centers and 6 different specialties who experienced multiple adverse effects of sleep loss on cognitive function, attention, professionalism, and task performance. Moreover, the reviewers found that:
“Subjective awareness of sleepiness seems to plateau with time, resulting in a situation in which the individual is unaware of the level of his or her impairment.”
These studies suggest a lack of conviction as to the individual impact of sleep deprivation on a medical resident and establish the difficulty of creating policies therein. At WHOOP, we know that physiology is highly individual; more often than not you can’t draw any meaningful insights from global comparisons, even when controlling for demography. As such, sleep need cannot be a generic population recommendation, but rather a daily evaluation on a personal level. WHOOP calculates daily sleep need based on four components:",4/7/17
the-impact-of-night-call-do-doctors-need-whoop,The Impact of Night Call: Do Doctors Need WHOOP?,"I’m at that age where friends I used to consider peers are now full-blown lawyers, doctors, and professors. PROFESSORS. What was formerly brunch conversations consisting of the shenanigans from the night before is now me talking about seeing the Beauty and the Beast movie and loving it and my friend describing the latest infant she’s brought into the world. “Yep, our Saturdays sound similar,” I respond before taking a large gulp of my drink.
In fact, I’ve had so many friends go through medical school and now residency that I pretty much know what that entails. (Just kidding, guys, I’ll never understand your pain. Never.) The tales are harrowing and one thing is abundantly clear: Residency, particularly the first year, demands a grueling schedule. The safety implications of that long shift work are of great debate in the medical community, with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education tasked with evaluating degree of risk and establishing standards accordingly.
In 2011, it was decreed that a first-year medical resident’s work shift would be capped at 16 hours. After careful review of the impact of that policy, however, that ruling is about to change. Effective July 1 of this year, first-year residents will be allowed to work 24 hour shifts without a break, with the allowance that this can extend to 28 hours when the attending physician deems it is necessary.
The task force assigned to assess the 16-hour cap reviewed over 1,000 published articles and garnered extensive input from stakeholders. Its conclusion was that the shift cap was a disruption to team-based care and supervisory systems, causing a significant negative impact on the professional education of the first-year resident. There remains, however, a great deal of disagreement as to the effect of prolonged shift work on resident medical students’ job performance and the subsequent risk this poses to the patient and the hospital.",4/7/17
the-new-kid-on-the-block,The New Kid on the Block,"Beach volleyball has forever been an intriguing sport to me. Growing up in New England, I’ve never had much exposure to it. In fact, the only real interaction I’ve had was on Saturday afternoons as I’d flip through the channels and find a presumed southern California AVP match. I knew some names: Karch Kiraly, Misty May-Treanor and Kerry Walsh Jennings. I’ve even played summertime pick-up games, so I had a sense of what was going on. However, like all sports, there are subtle nuances that make up the sport’s backbone that I simply didn’t know, and only people who are engrained in the sport can see.
So while you’re probably like me and only recognize those previously mentioned names, we’re finding out why a new name you’ve most likely never heard of, Lauren Sieckmann, is turning heads and becoming one of the hottest newcomers in beach volleyball.",10/12/16
the-new-kid-on-the-block,The New Kid on the Block,"The Nuances of Recovery
Not all volleyball players have the luxury of high salaries and large endorsement deals, thus when athletes travel for matches, many of them can’t afford the luxurious hotels that promote healthy Sleep hygiene. Therefore many athletes opt for crashing on friends’ couches or wherever they can find a cheap housing option. The issue with this is that sleeping on couches is not an ideal way for professional athletes to recover.
Now that Lauren understands the importance of Recovery, she gets creative when she is on the road for matches.
She emulates what it’s like staying at home. She builds make-shift ice baths, has a personally administered curfew, tries to cut out all the ambient light from windows, and always makes Sleep a priority, no matter what.
“Every match is equally important. I need to be 100% ready to perform. There is no time for injuries or lack of Sleep. You have to be at your best the entire season and Recovery is the key to that.”
“Utilizing Recovery to its fullest is my main goal this year. Especially in volleyball, people don’t tend to peak until their late 20s early 30s. If you don’t recover properly and are not consistently healthy throughout your career, then you’re done in this sport.”",10/12/16
the-new-kid-on-the-block,The New Kid on the Block,"The AVP Tour and Personal Accountability
Joining the AVP Tour has been a new journey for Lauren. Switching from the five teammate sport of indoor to the one teammate sport of beach volleyball has affected different aspects of her training.
“In beach volleyball, everything is self-driven. You have to find your own partner, you have to plan your own practices, you have to call a coach – let alone find a coach – and you have to be your own advocate.” Lauren mentions that you are more accountable for your actions because you are your own agent and your own general manager.
Having this personal accountability as an athlete can be daunting. Just training alone is something that requires more than enough mental and physical energy, and diverting too much time to training and managing one’s career opens the door to dismissing Recovery as an imperative aspect of athlete optimization.
WHOOP fills these holes. It provides the data athletes need in order to monitor Sleep, assess Recovery, and predict performance so that they can get back to what they enjoy most – playing their sport.",10/12/16
the-new-kid-on-the-block,The New Kid on the Block,"Prior to WHOOP, “performance” was the only aspect most athletes cared about. In baseball, you have a batting average. In basketball, you have a shooting percentage. In all sports, you have a winning and losing percentage. All of these end results are highly valued and meticulously measured. However, to date, there has been no metric for how well an athlete has recovered from practice, or how well they slept the night before. WHOOP is now that tool.
“I never considered Recovery as an important aspect of my training. In high school, I would go to bed late and wake up late, but then in college, I started getting more Sleep and saw huge improvements in my game. When I prioritized Sleep, I got stronger, faster, and better. People noticed improvements in my game and would ask me for my secret, ‘what was I doing?’ they’d say. Ever since then, Sleep has been a staple in my routine and even more so now that I’m on the AVP Tour.”",10/12/16

– Qualified for the 2010 youth Olympic games
– Played in the 2011 FIVB Word Championships
– Won the 2009 Nebraska Gatorade Player of the Year
– Plays professionally on the AVP Tour.
She’s impressive, trust me.
I was able to sit down with Lauren and learn about how she’s quickly excelled in this sport.
“In high school, I was a classic hustler,” Sieckmann said. “I was an addict. I would go to practice two hours early and make my dad hit balls at me. I would train before practice, after practice and during every moment in-between.”
Lauren was obsessed with the game. She consistently read books about volleyball, watched a myriad of matches, and practiced nightly setting drills in her basement as she obsessed over her own development. She even confessed to occasionally sleeping with a volleyball.
“These things are important to me,” Lauren states, “they are what separate me from the pack and they’re the things that have helped me get to where I want to be in the sport.”
It’s hard to deny that Lauren trains incredibly hard. In a sport that requires you to be your own manager, agent, and sometimes coach, Lauren’s steadfast mentality to date has ostensibly masked her vision to recognize if her Recovery has affected her performance on the court or not. I say this because her mindset is so laser-focused on training and improvement, that it has often caused her to overlook the importance of Recovery.

Former players with an astute “knowledge of the game” became managers, while the most successful managers often went on to become general managers.
In 2002, a 40-year-old GM named Billy Beane constructed a low-budget Oakland A’s squad by using advanced statistics known as sabermetrics to evaluate players. That team went 103-59 and was the impetus for Michael Lewis’ 2003 book, Moneyball (made into a movie in 2011, pictured).
The Boston Red Sox attempted to lure Beane away from the A’s following Oakland’s spectacular 2002 season. When Beane declined Boston’s offer, the Red Sox made 28-year-old Yale graduate Theo Epstein the youngest GM in MLB history. Epstein’s playing career never extended beyond high school, but he was a stats geek who fully embraced sabermetrics.
A little more than a decade later, an astounding 11 general managers are products of Ivy League schools, with four coming from Harvard alone. Yet another went to MIT. That list doesn’t even include Epstein, who now serves as President of Baseball Operations for the World Series Champion Chicago Cubs.
From David Schoenfield of ESPN.com:
“Not every team has an Ivy League whiz kid running things — Al Avila of the Tigers, for example, has a 25-year history in the game, primarily as a scout — but they all have an analytics department of various robustness and influence. In other words, the brain power in the game has grown in multiples since Lewis penned his ode to Beane.”
While Beane and the A’s were able to get ahead of the competition with statistical analysis 15 years ago, that’s no longer possible today. Schoenfield writes:",1/30/17
the-new-moneyball-247-physiological-data,The New Moneyball? 24/7 Physiological Data,"“It all suggests winning is harder than ever, and sustaining a high level of success even harder. Indeed, we can see this when comparing the five-year periods of 2011-2015 to 1998-2002. Conveniently, both periods had 42 teams win 90-plus games in a season, but what happened the following season reveals how smarter front offices have changed the game: Teams in the more recent period not only had a lower average win total in the 90-win season, but suffered a bigger decline the following season, were less likely to win more games or to win 90 again and more likely to have a losing season.”
The title of Schoenfield’s piece is “Now that everyone is smart, GMs must go bold to succeed.” He makes the case that GMs need to take risks in order to put together winning ball clubs, by gambling with the future to succeed in the present. Schoenfield cites an example of the Boston Red Sox’s recent trade of top prospects Yoan Moncada and Michael Kopech for ace pitcher Chris Sale. While Sale could help guide Boston to another World Series in the near future, Moncada and Kopech might become stars for the next decade and beyond.
What if there’s another way to gain a competitive advantage that isn’t fraught with such uncertainties? A “Moneyball 2.0,” so to speak?
The next round of advanced statistical analytics may come from players’ physiological data. A recent Fangraph’s piece examining home-field advantage in baseball cited findings from the WHOOP MLB Performance Study, which observed a significant decline in players’ Recovery the day after traveling.

the-new-old-tennis-champion,"The New ""Old"" Tennis Champion","When Serena Williams won Wimbledon this year, she was just two months shy of her 35th birthday, making her the oldest women ever to emerge victorious at a Grand Slam singles event. Williams extended a record she’d actually set 12 months earlier, when she captured the 2015 Wimbledon title at the age of 33.
It comes as no surprise that the greatest female tennis player of all time is still winning Grand Slams well into her thirties. However, it’s not just Serena who’s doing it. Li Na took the Australian Open championship in 2014 at age 31, just her second major title. In 2015, Flavia Pennetta won the U.S. Open at 33, the first Slam of her career. The runner-up was 32-year-old Roberta Vinci, a first-time finalist.
A similar trend is happening with the men as well. Roger Federer reached the 2015 U.S. Open Finals shortly after turning 34. Now 31, Stan Wawrinka took home this year’s U.S. Open championship after winning the French in 2015 and the Australian in 2014. At 29, defending Wimbledon champ Andy Murray recently became the oldest first-time No. 1 ranked player in more than 30 years.
One of my earliest tennis memories is of watching a 17-year-old Michael Chang shock the world at the 1989 French Open as the youngest male Slam winner of all time. The following summer, Jennifer Capriati became the new teen sensation by making her pro debut at 13, while a 16-year-old Monica Seles rose to the No. 2 world ranking (she was No. 1 by the age of 17). In 1997, Martina Hingis was 16 when she won three of the four slams on her way to No. 1. Even Serena was only 17 when she won her first Grand Slam tournament at the 1999 U.S. Open.
Those days of teenage domination are long gone. With improved technology, medicine and nutrition, older players are capable of maintaining higher levels of fitness than ever before, allowing them to succeed at more advanced ages. Take a look at these numbers from USA Today Sports:",12/22/16
the-new-old-tennis-champion,"The New ""Old"" Tennis Champion","Perhaps the best example of today’s “older” tennis champion is the current top-ranked woman, Angelique Kerber. The 28-year-old competed on the tour for 9 years before finally winning her first Grand Slam, in Australia this past January. Kerber began the season at No. 10, but shot all the way up to No. 1 (supplanting Williams) after also capturing the U.S. Open title in September.
In April, Kerber spoke with The Independent about her re-dedication to fitness:
“I’m feeling fitter than I did in previous years … I think in the last pre-season I maybe improved my fitness by two or three percent. It’s given me a lot of confidence when I go into, for example, three-hour matches. It also helps me to recover faster between matches. What also gives me a lot more confidence is that in the biggest moments I can beat very good players.”
Better fitness and smarter training also helped Murray ascend to the top of the rankings. From Sports Illustrated’s Tim Newcomb:
“Training has evolved for Murray over his career, shifting from his days as a scrawny junior trying to hit with the big boys on tour to now knowing the limits of his 29-year-old body and the balance between on-court preparation, rest, intense workouts and the most recent addition to his regimen: flexibility. … By working in flexibility, Murray has created more freedom of movement for on-court points and for when he trains, which also reduces soreness following a match. ‘I wish I had done this when I was younger,’ he says. ‘I wish I had done more. I focused on other stuff and that was the thing that got missed. When I was 19 or 20 I could train hard and wake up the next day and feel fine. In my mid-20s, when on tour, things start to hurt a bit more and it is not as easy.’”",12/22/16
the-new-old-tennis-champion,"The New ""Old"" Tennis Champion","Murray’s sentiment should come as no surprise, nor should the fact that he and Kerber are being more careful with their training than they did when they were younger. Here’s what Geoff McDonald, head coach of the Vanderbilt Women’s tennis team, told WHOOP about the habits of his players:
“We invested in WHOOP to help our athletes understand the importance of rest and recovery to maximize performance. Several of our players were prone to overtraining, burning the candle at both ends with long, highly intense training sessions [both on the tennis court and in the gym] followed by a long night hitting the books. As college students, they believed they were impervious to performance drops, and they did not understand the importance of recovery and sleep.”
For high school and college kids trying to become the next great tennis pro, there’s a lesson to be learned from today’s elite veterans: Train smarter, not harder.

the-nfls-london-conundrum,The NFL's London Conundrum,"When NFL teams take the field this Sunday, for the first time in three weeks, they will all be on American soil (or turf, technically). The league’s 2016 three-game slate in London has come to a close, culminating with a 27-27 draw last week between the Cincinnati Bengals and Washington Redskins.
Nobody likes a tie, although it seemed a fitting conclusion to the year’s “International Series,” an NFL endeavor that many football lovers in this country are not particularly fond of. The attempt to broaden the sports’ appeal overseas has led to games with a growing reputation for being sloppy, poorly played affairs, and the October 30 Bengals-Redskins tilt was no exception.
The scoreless 15-minute overtime period (which extended past 1 pm Eastern time, when NFL fans typically first tune in for the day) consisted of two punts, a missed field goal, a fumble and a -1 yard drive on the final possession that began in Bengals territory but concluded with Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins throwing the ball wildly out of bounds on the game’s last play.
A week earlier, the Los Angeles Rams dropped an ugly 17-10 decision to the New York Giants in London. Los Angeles dominated the time of possession (35:03-24:57) but failed to score after the first quarter, in large part due to four interceptions thrown by quarterback Case Keenum, including one on each of the Rams’ final three drives.
On October 2, the Jacksonville Jaguars defeated the Indianapolis Colts 30-27 across the pond. The contest included 223 penalty yards, over 100 more that the NFL average this season (121.4 per game).
Teams were penalized a combined 163.3 yards per game in London this year, roughly 40 above the norm. Clubs also averaged 3.0 turnovers per game while playing in London in 2016, slightly more than the league-wide average of 2.6. Spanning 17 total London matchups dating back to 2007, the turnover average there stands at 3.3.",11/4/16
the-nfls-london-conundrum,The NFL's London Conundrum,"It should come as no surprise that the overall quality of the on-field product suffers when clubs make the trip to Europe. In a study of athletes using the WHOOP system, data revealed that although travel itself can take it’s toll, changing time zones also has a significant impact on performance. The NFL made a point to schedule byes for each team the week after visiting London, but all six squads took the field the previous Sunday, giving them little opportunity to adjust to their new surroundings and the massive time-zone switch. Clubs adopted varying philosophies in getting there, in particular the Rams and Giants.
Prior to their Sunday, October 23 meeting, Los Angeles (facing a shift of eight time zones) landed in England on Monday, flying directly from Detroit after losing there to the Lions. New York, on the other hand, chose to remain stateside until Thursday, arriving in London less that 48 hours before kickoff. From Martin Rodgers of USA Today Sports:
“Ten seasons into the NFL’s London experiment, and no one seems much wiser about how to best tackle the conundrum of time zones and travel.”
Perhaps the reason for this is simply that there isn’t a universally correct answer? No two athletes are the same. Every player’s body responds differently to different situations. Maybe heading to London a week early is the right choice to get some guys properly adjusted, but for others sticking to normal routines and “powering through” the hours before game time is the way to go?
WHOOP tracks each individual’s Sleep and Recovery, and in turn could help teams determine which players are capable of excelling under specific travel circumstances. As the NFL looks to expand its product across the globe, WHOOP has the potential to improve the games its fans back home are watching.",11/4/16

Today, Pilates is a popular workout among elite athletes, including players in the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL, and among Olympians. Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown cites Pilates as a crucial part of his workout routine. “It’s all about control and body position,” Brown said in an interview with STACK.
The popularity continues to grow as coaches see the importance of dynamic exercises that mimic the way the body is supposed to move. For instructors like Kennedy, being able to monitor performance with a wearable like WHOOP gives her the data to know how she can balance work and personal fitness without burning out.

the-power-of-pilates-meet-erin-kennedy,The Power of Pilates: Meet Erin Kennedy,"In 2004, Erin Kennedy got laid off from her corporate job. Seizing an opportunity to change career paths, Erin decided she would help others make significant improvements to their bodies, the same way she had a few years earlier. Within a year, she opened up her own Pilates studio, The Body Center, in Brookline, MA.
To the average person, Pilates is unfamiliar territory. The equipment, with its pulleys and springs, can look intimidating. Unless you’ve attended multiple classes or delved into the philosophy behind it all, Pilates might seem like just another after-work exercise routine.
Pilates, however, is far from just another group class at the YMCA. It has a rich history dating back to the early 1900s, when founder Joseph Pilates opened the first studio in New York. Inspired by his time as a nurse in Germany during WW1, Joseph experimented with springs on hospital beds to help otherwise immobile patients regain movement, tone muscle, and recover faster. Hugely popular with dancers and ballerinas, the Pilates movement took off with studios popping up throughout the U.S. and across seas throughout the 20th century.
“The reason a lot of athletes have adopted a Pilates practice is because it trains us to move in a way that we should move. The way our body was born to move,” says Kennedy, who trains individual clients and teaches classes for up to 8 hours daily in her studio in Brookline.
Erin has been teaching Pilates since 2003, shortly before she got laid off from her corporate job, ruptured a tendon in her calf, and decided to take a new approach to training to stay fit. The typical overachiever, she recalls a fast-paced life in the corporate world by day, and working late as a fitness instructor by night. She felt completely out of touch with the natural movement of her body. The combination of long days in the office and nightly workouts fueled by coffee caused unnecessary strain.",2/28/17
the-power-of-pilates-meet-erin-kennedy,The Power of Pilates: Meet Erin Kennedy,"Erin performs a Reverse Expansion on the Pilates Reformer. The high kneeling posture opens up hip flexors and shoulders, which often tighten up from too much sitting.
As Erin searched for a solution, she decided that yoga movements were too slow, and stretching on her own was too boring. Enter Pilates. What makes Pilates different from any other exercise on the market is its ability to target the muscles that directly support your skeleton including the spine, shoulders, and hips. According to Erin, when these muscles (the smaller ones a weighted machine alone can’t isolate) get stronger, your skeleton is supported so your other muscles can do their job. As a result, your body is more efficient, you’re less injury prone, and you effectively carry less tension.
The 5 Basic Principles of Pilates are as follows:
Erin follows the Stott Pilates practice, a methodology informed by modern sports therapy and an understanding of biomechanics to improve athletic performance. More specifically, Stott is designed to restore the spine’s natural curve and create symmetrical balance surrounding the joints. Through repeated dynamic movements using the Pilates reformer (the sliding mat seen below with the spring settings), you are challenged to use your whole body to maintain balance, stabilize your core, and run through the movements in a very intentional manner.
Erin performs The Hundred. This quintessential Pilates exercise encourages deep breathing patterns and increases blood circulation while working core stability and control.
When Erin started using WHOOP, she immediately noticed how she was able to effectively track the Strain of each Pilates workout. As an instructor who teaches over 30 hours a week, it’s important for Erin to make sure she isn’t overdoing it each day, so she can have the energy to complete her own workout, and to help others.",2/28/17
the-research-and-development-behind-strength-trainer,The Research and Development Behind Strength Trainer,"Building The Algorithm To Measure Strength
This game-changing advancement is an evolution of WHOOP technology built through WHOOP Labs, the internal research wing that conducts scientific studies on a daily basis, and PUSH, a velocity-based training solution acquired by WHOOP. PUSH spent nearly a decade developing hardware and software to track strength training in high performance settings around the world.
The first step in the development process involved integrating PUSH algorithms into WHOOP hardware. Strength Trainer was then tested in WHOOP Labs for over a year with thousands of hours to study the impact of load on the human body. Studies were made up equally of men and women, and of all skill levels. For the initial validations, the studies required ~250 repetitions of each exercise, and each study asked 20 participants to complete a minimum of a variety of movement patterns, including squats, deadlifts, Olympic lifts, thrusters, vertical and horizontal rows, and presses. Accessory and bodyweight movements were also included, like push ups, pull ups, dips, inverted rows, curls, and bent over rows, as were exercises that used other equipment like kettlebells, dumbbells, and medicine balls. In total over 10,000 repetitions were collected for the initial validations.
After validating that WHOOP could effectively track strength training exercises, the team then focused on calculating a new metric that could properly capture the effort and load on the body during resistance training activities. This metric had two primary requirements: (1) it needed to use the inertial motion unit (accelerometer and gyroscope in the WHOOP sensor) to produce the data and (2) it needed to be grounded in science and the first principles of biomechanics.",4/26/23
the-research-and-development-behind-strength-trainer,The Research and Development Behind Strength Trainer,"Final Validations of Strength Trainer
The final piece of the validation process was to assess the reliability of the new measures using WHOOP. Participants came into WHOOP Labs and completed the same workout multiple times. The study found that muscular load had a 97% correlation in results from the first workout to the repeated workout. Ratings of perceived exertion only had an 85% repeatability score. This showed that the new muscular load metric gave users a repeatable measure of their strain when completing strength training activities.
Strength Trainer was a collaborative effort from many teams within WHOOP, including: Data Science, Sport Science, Signal Processing, Product, Software, and Design. This all-new feature will help members unlock the ability to track their strength training workouts, and measure muscular load to ultimately get the credit they deserve in their Strain scores.",4/26/23
the-research-and-development-behind-strength-trainer,The Research and Development Behind Strength Trainer,"## The Need For Measuring Muscular Load
WHOOP members have come to know their Strain scores like what they had for breakfast – it’s part of their daily routine. Strain and Day Strain represent the total cardiovascular load during an activity and over the duration of a full day. Strain is a great general measure of physical stress because the score is directly based on heart rate. However, if you’re a WHOOP member who is primarily focused on weightlifting and strength training, you may have noticed that your Strain doesn’t always match the effort you put in because weightlifting predominantly stresses your muscles and not your heart.
Strength training is primarily driven by the neuromuscular system and the musculoskeletal system. In order for WHOOP to truly evaluate the comprehensive strain that you put on your body regardless of activity, we needed to develop a better way to quantify muscular load – the measured amount of stress put on muscles, bones, joints, and tissues.",4/26/23
the-research-and-development-behind-strength-trainer,The Research and Development Behind Strength Trainer,"A New Metric: Muscular Load
Historically, weight training has been measured with basic mathematical methods using external load, which is the amount of weight being used during an exercise. The two main components most often used are volume and intensity. Volume represents the “how much” part of weightlifting, and intensity represents the “how hard.” This is typically measured by the percentage of the maximum amount of weight an individual can lift, also known as One Repetition Maximum (1RM). For example if you can lift 100 lbs, 80% of your 1RM will be 80 lbs. The closer you lift to your maximum, the higher the intensity of the lift.
Using these classical measures gives a basic understanding of the overall external loading, that is the amount of load occurring outside of the body. However, these measurements don’t paint a full picture, as they lack details about the specific motions of the exercise, the amount of body mass used during those motions, and how fast the lifter is moving. It doesn’t take into account the specific motions of the exercise, or the amount of body mass used during those motions. Lifting 100lbs during a bench press vs. lifting 100lbs produce different impacts on the body, and lifting 100 lbs slowly versus quickly produces two different adaptations and would fatigue the lifter differently. Perhaps the biggest limitation in using this classic measure is that it fails to account for any biological signal, meaning there is no data coming from the human body, just knowledge of the external load.
Muscular load measures movement and its underlying physics using the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors in WHOOP, and combines these signals with advanced biomechanics and mathematics. This metric includes both volume and intensity components.",4/26/23
the-research-and-development-behind-strength-trainer,The Research and Development Behind Strength Trainer,"Volume is measured similarly to traditional volume load, but it incorporates effective mass. It takes into account your body mass, but only includes the parts of your body that are moving and doing the work. For example, a full body exercise like a squat or clean and jerk will have more musculoskeletal load than a bench press.
Intensity quantifies how much effort or exertion you are giving to complete the lift. The closer you are to lifting your maximum, the higher the intensity of the lift is.
Lastly, the team wanted to align muscular load with the current WHOOP Strain algorithm. WHOOP now accounts for both the cardiovascular and muscular load of your workouts to give a total strain score. For anyone who strength trains, this adjustment to the strain algorithm will help with more effective training and recovery.
As Strength Trainer learns your baselines, upper limits, and lower limits, it will give you more individualized and accurate muscular load values, and intensity and volume will adapt to you over time.",4/26/23
the-smart-locker-room,The Smart Locker Room?,"“The number one problem is lack of sleep, and right now what guys do all over the country is bring a pillow and go find a staircase or locker or hallway, and they’ll lay down and sleep, especially during two-a-days and really all year long. The nap room cost very little and is a great benefit.”
In October of 2012, Judy Bautista of the New York Times wrote about the then brand new locker room constructed by the NFL’s Jacksonville Jaguars:
“[It] looks like a cross between a high-end nightclub (a 41,600-watt sound system) and a five-star hotel (stacked stone wall tile) and is so deluxe that the team recently used it to host a dinner for sponsors. That would have been an unappetizing proposition in the days of cinder-block rooms decorated with overflowing laundry baskets and crumpled tape. … The Jaguars have embraced their inner interior designer, replete with two waterfalls that splash into plunge pools, Euro-style toilets inside individual private stalls and leather chairs custom-built extra wide to accommodate even the heftiest linemen. There are ventilation systems built into each locker to dry equipment, helping the Jaguars to pull off the unimaginable: the locker room smells like a new car instead of a sweaty sock.”
As impressive as these state-of-the-art locker rooms are, what can we expect to see in the years ahead? From a recent post on IBM.com’s Think Leaders blog:
“What if a locker room could listen to the coaches and players? What if it could automatically cue up video clips of key plays in the first half, based on what the players and coaches are discussing at halftime? What if it analyzed statistics, recommended substitutions, and suggested alternative plays?",12/27/16
the-smart-locker-room,The Smart Locker Room?,"Elite athletes spend an extraordinary amount of time in the locker room. For pros, it’s basically the equivalent of their office, as well as their home away from home. This is what inspired WHOOP founder and CEO Will Ahmed to name our blog “The Locker.” In his words:
“For athletes reading this, you know that locker rooms are both sacred and messy places. They’re private and intimate, yet boisterous and warm. There’s a pact for those on the inside; a curiosity for those left out. They can be emotional places: Inspirational speeches surround victorious athletes; a lonely silence can follow those who come up short. Clothes and equipment are tossed about but also seemingly shared from one athlete to another, an unspoken understanding of ownership signified by numbers, scratches, and stains that to an outsider seem indiscernible. There’s an order to this chaos.”
In my days as a high school tennis player and later a coach, I was impressed with any locker room that had doors on the stalls and a floor I wasn’t afraid to walk around on barefoot. But as technology takes on its ever-growing role in the evolution of sports, locker rooms are becoming increasingly more advanced.

Clemson University is scheduled to unveil a new facility in January that, in addition to all of those things, will also feature an indoor golf simulator, an arcade, a bowling alley, laser tag and a recovery/nap room.

the-speed-project-ultrarunners,The Speed Project: Tracking Two Ultrarunners’ 340-Mile Trek Across the Desert,"Prioritizing Sleep and Recovery Before The Speed Project
How do you prime your body for peak performance leading up to an event that is going to destroy your recovery day after day? First, you have to do the training and get the miles under your belt. For Margot and David, two skilled runners who regularly log anywhere from 50 to 100 miles per week, cardiovascular fitness wasn’t the issue. They tapered before the race, focused on sleep and nutrition, and took care of any nagging ailments well before the race date through massage, chiro, and acupuncture. For this event, recovery and preparedness were far more mental than physical.
“A lot of the prep work really had to do with the logistics of the route, supplies that would be needed, and aligning with my team. I went into it pretty calm, but excited. This was a new challenge and road that I have never been down before. My plan was really to listen to my body and be adaptable and learn along the way,” explained Kilgore.
For Margot, it was all about getting into that “flow.” Trusting her body, having confidence, and knowing her body.
In terms of recovery, people underestimate the benefit of mental clarity. Research shows that anxiety and stress have a negative relationship with heart rate variability (HRV). A high HRV typically correlates with greater cardiovascular fitness and may indicate you are more resilient to stress. It was obvious that 340 miles under the unforgiving, blazing sun would be physically challenging, but without a calm mind and heart, it might be virtually impossible.",6/17/21
the-speed-project-ultrarunners,The Speed Project: Tracking Two Ultrarunners’ 340-Mile Trek Across the Desert,"According to both runners, sleep was probably the most important thing they could focus on during TSP. The goal of TSP is to do it fast, which means you’re not sleeping through the night. Instead, you take power naps throughout the day, and your full “sleep” is maybe a few hours. This allows the runners to keep going at a rhythmic, albeit draining, pace.
Both runners nearly maxed out on their WHOOP strain each day at 20.7, logging up to 10 activities per day with each segment of running. The charts below specify how many hours of sleep WHOOP told them they needed (green), versus the total amount they were able to get (blue).
The amount of sleep David got each night compared to the amount his body needed.
Margot’s hours of sleep each night compared to what she needed.
What’s interesting to note is how Margot bounced back after a few days with her recovery and HRV. While sleep was still at a minimum, there was a small spike in both metrics on Day 4 with a 44% recovery (up from 23%), and they continued to improve over the next few days. On her final day of the race she had a 67% recovery in the green. It’s a phenomenon we’ve seen before in some athletes taking on immense strain for days on end, coincidentally also in a recent 700-mile bike ride through Death Valley.
This may seem counterintuitive, but a deeper dive into her data and understanding of human physiology tells a unique story. Margot’s sleep efficiency and consistency during this time far exceeded David’s, which meant she was getting more quality sleep at more consistent intervals.
“I prioritized getting to sleep by 10-11 pm each night for my sake and my crew’s sake,” she explained. She also prioritized recovery modalities including ice baths for her legs and compression sleeves.",6/17/21
the-speed-project-ultrarunners,The Speed Project: Tracking Two Ultrarunners’ 340-Mile Trek Across the Desert,"“I felt so raw and really alive.”
The point of The Speed Project is to push the mind and body to unconventional places, bordering on an alternate, surreal reality. A majority of the time you’re in a state of fight or flight, battling the elements and making quick decisions to adapt to your surroundings. The point of The Speed Project is to be as uncomfortable as possible.
If there was anything grounding and objective about the experience, you can point to the data. WHOOP added a new component to the event, offering hard numbers and straightforward metrics to help the runners better understand their bodies. For Margot and David, the question was never “How can I focus on rest?” but instead, “How can I make the most of the situation I’m in?” And oftentimes, that’s what true performance is all about–optimizing what you are given and taking each day as it comes.",6/17/21
the-speed-project-ultrarunners,The Speed Project: Tracking Two Ultrarunners’ 340-Mile Trek Across the Desert,"What is The Speed Project?
It all started as a lofty idea, a musing over drinks back in 2013.
“What if we ran from LA to Vegas?”
Together, Nils and a team of 5 others including renowned coach Blue Benadum made plans to run a relay from the Santa Monica pier to the iconic Las Vegas sign by any means necessary. It would mean renting an RV, scouting out routes in Death Valley, and mentally preparing themselves for very little sleep. Thus the mantra was born: “No Rules” and “No Spectators.” There was no designated route and no guarantee.
Five years later it’s become the official-unofficial race of the modern-day distance runner, purely by word of mouth, with the help of some beautiful Instagram photography. You can’t sign up (you have to be invited), you have to supply your own support crew, and you’re pretty much on your own as you plan your trek across the desert.
It’s been likened to Hunter S. Thompson’s novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, a surreal, drug-fueled car trip across the desert complete with philosophical banter, spiritual awakenings, and countercultural commentary. The Speed Project is a little bit like that, minus the drugs. You’re breaking down the body through physical exertion while achieving spiritual enlightenment along the way.",6/17/21
the-speed-project-ultrarunners,The Speed Project: Tracking Two Ultrarunners’ 340-Mile Trek Across the Desert,"A Tale of Recovery, Strain, and (Lack of) Sleep
On Monday, May 24th at 4 am, David and Margot took off from the Santa Monica pier along with a few other solo runners. For the next several days, they logged nearly 80-100 miles per day, passing through Los Angeles National Forest, Death Valley, and the Mojave Desert. As expected, their bodies were exhausted, burnt, and beat up, which was very apparent in their WHOOP data. David finished TSP in 4 days (which accounts for the N/A data in charts that follow), while Margot completed it in 6.
David and Margot’s daily HRV, beginning the day before they started running, as well as their averages for the week.
“The biggest challenges of the journey were definitely the heat during the day with not a cloud in the sky, and going into uncharted territory. I ended up having to bushwack for about 50 miles and ate it in the middle of the night on some barbed wire entwined with the sand. It dropped me down a 6-8 foot sandy ledge where I landed on a rock with my left quad. I grinded through about 10 more night miles after and then went to bed. When I woke up that was probably my lowest moment,” said Kilgore. This happened about 48 hours into the race, or the halfway point for David.
You can see an immediate drop in WHOOP recovery for both runners once the race began on 5/24. This was likely due to lack of sleep from having to wake up at 3 am for a 4 am start time. Margot only got 3.1 hours of sleep and woke up with a 31% recovery, while Kilgore slept for 5.1 hours and woke up at 53% (see sleep charts below).
There was a dIp in recovery for both runners when the race started. While David’s continued to drop, Margot’s actually increaseD over the last few days as her body adapted to the elements.",6/17/21
the-speed-project-ultrarunners,The Speed Project: Tracking Two Ultrarunners’ 340-Mile Trek Across the Desert,"Even though David’s data showed poorer recovery and sleep quality compared to Margot, it wasn’t for a lack of trying. “I learned a lot from the first few days on prioritizing recovery and sleep,” he said. “I have never had to sleep before in a race, and man does it help a ton! I never felt like I grasped the importance of sleep even before running TSP. Each time my legs felt completely flat or exhausted, I could nap for a few hours and it was like they were better just like that. Of course not back to 100%, but exponentially better.”
“I usually felt like I slept a few more hours than it said I did, so I must not have been getting as good of sleep as I thought, which is good to know,” added David.",6/17/21
the-speed-project-ultrarunners,The Speed Project: Tracking Two Ultrarunners’ 340-Mile Trek Across the Desert,"In the fall of 2019, ultrarunner Margot Fleming got a text from a friend asking for a particularly unique inquiry. That friend was Nils Arend, co-founder of The Speed Project (TSP), a 340-mile unsanctioned relay race from Santa Monica to Las Vegas, and he wanted to know if Margot would be interested in running the full thing, completely solo.
Without hesitation, Margot agreed and hired coach Lisa Batchen to formulate a realistic training plan. While the endeavor was certainly an extreme challenge and maybe a little crazy, she had a reputable running history with 40 marathons and 8 ultras under her belt and felt the event was attainable. She’d also been using WHOOP for a little over a year to better understand her recovery from high mileage.
Only a few months before TSP this year (it’d been pushed back from 2020), ultrarunner David Kilgore heard from Arend about the solo journey, which could be anywhere from 300 to 340 miles depending on the scouted route. According to Kilgore, it was “not planned,” but he decided, “Hell yeah, let’s do it!” For Kilgore, a known personality in the world of running who ran the relay portion of TSP back in 2018 with Tracksmith, attempting the solo mission was not unlike the similar niche, extreme events he’d done before.

With WHOOP, I now can measure my Recovery and how it relates to my performance. Prior, I was assuming that I slept well or that I didn’t get enough rest. I really didn’t know why on certain days I was saying ‘Man I’m out of it today.’ With WHOOP, I now have no excuse. My performance is in my control.”
## “My sleep performance was 100% and my recovery was 98%. That day I told myself, ‘there are no excuses.’”
“My sleep performance was 100% and my recovery was 98%. That day I told myself, ‘there are no excuses.’”
“I remember once having an awful sparring session in Brooklyn. I was out of it. I told my coach, ‘Listen, I had a 56% recovery today. I went to bed late and I was watching HBO fights, so I didn’t get much sleep.’ I justified my readiness to perform.” Jorge said.
“Two weeks later we sparred again and I made sure to listen to my WHOOP Sleep Planner. In the morning my Sleep Performance was 100% and my Recovery was 98%. That morning I told myself, ‘there are no excuses.’ When I sparred it was amazing. My coach noticed a huge difference and asked, ‘what was your Recovery last night?’” Jorge laughed and said, “You see? Now my entire team sees the positive difference WHOOP makes. They’re bought in.”
In addition to WHOOP, Jorge has been working with Dr. Shawn Arent from the Center for Health and Human Performance at Rutgers.

The tales permeated from side comments into full-blown actions. At the age of 11, Jorge habitually wore a gray hooded sweatshirt and went for long runs through his neighborhood. He’d use this time to give various bystanders his best boxing impression as he threw jabs and punches into the defenseless air leaving his imaginary foe paralyzed and KO’d.
Shortly after that, in 2000, Jorge became close with his younger cousin – HBO boxer Jonathan Gonzalez. This was Jorge’s first introduction to organized boxing. “We went to one of his amateur fights and watched him compete. It was everything I imagined.”

Then in the middle of our breakfast, my prayers were finally answered.” In an abrupt manner, an older man walked over to Jorge and vehemently asked, as if he had earplugs in, “You want to box?” Jorge looked at his dad then back at the old man, “Yeah, I want to box.” “Well, there is a gym on route 27 behind the 7-Eleven. Those rings should serve you well.” Then, just as unexpectedly as the man appeared, he turned around and walked out of the shop.",8/30/16
the-story-of-jorge-diaz,The Story of Jorge Diaz: The Man Who Beat the Man,"Olympic Gold Medalist Meets the Floor
At the outset of his professional career, Jorge found himself in his biggest fight to date. In Madison Square Garden, in front of 10,000 people at an opening fight to an HBO bout, Jorge matched up against an Olympic gold medalist.
It was a dogfight. Round by round they were swapping vicious body-crushing punches. “People undoubtedly got their money’s worth,” Jorge said.
“In the last round with maybe a minute left, I got my moment. I remember being exhausted with my hands down covering my body, trying not to take any more gut-wrenching shots. I bent over, leaned forward, and came back up with a five-piece combination that fired-up my career. It was a right, left, right to the body, and then a hook up top, followed by a right hand. The hook up top knocked him out cold. He fell face first and didn’t move for some time. That was the best knockout I had for sure.” This was the moment Jorge and his team yearned for.
## When Boxing Got Real
Throughout Jorge’s career, he consistently had a man named Dwayne call him and give him constructive criticism about his fighting technique. Dwayne was a successful businessman who Jorge knew from childhood, and he also just so happened to have superior boxing knowledge that Jorge revered. As much as Jorge tried to get Dwayne to train him, it just never seemed to work out for the two of them. If it did, it would be the perfect match of brains and talent.
So Jorge continued with his career and continued to rely on the four pillars of boxing that got him to where he is today: tenacity, fortitude, commitment, and dedication. The only elusive roadblock Jorge faced is that he never learned the nuances of boxing. He never learned the strategies for manipulating opponents, the patience of control, the elegance of rhythm, distance, and timing. All of this was absent from his boxing skillset. However, things were about to change…",8/30/16

“Fight after fight, year after year, I kept training, and I kept winning.”
The next day Jorge rode his bike to the gym and spoke to Steve Rivera – the gym’s boxing czar. Steve and Jorge naturally gravitated toward each other. They were a perfect match. A young athlete eager to grow and fine-tune his skills, and an established mentor looking for a hopeful athlete to mold and shape. “He fell in love with me and I with him,” Jorge said. “Over the years he gave me a lot, so I didn’t want to disappoint him.”
In his high school years, Jorge started to fight competitively for the first time. “We started fighting and we started winning. Fight after fight, year after year, I kept training, and I kept winning.” Then just like any relationship, Steve and Jorge began bumping heads when the stakes got bigger.
When Jorge won the state championship and advanced to the high school regionals, Steve didn’t want him competing because he didn’t think Jorge was ready. “I told myself that if I won State I was going to the Regionals, whether anybody liked it or not,” Jorge said. So against Steve’s wishes, Jorge went up to Lake Placid to the Regionals and steamrolled the competition, advancing to the Nationals. At the National Championship, Jorge placed second in the featherweight division.
This success left Jorge feeling that he didn’t need a coach at the moment, so he and Steve parted ways.",8/30/16

One day, after 9 years, Dwayne walked into Jorge’s gym without any announcement and asked to be his coach. It was an unceremonious agreement at best. Very few words were exchanged, but Jorge and Dwayne knew this was the right call. It was the missing centerpiece that Jorge’s camp was looking for.
“Now that I’m working with Dwayne, my philosophy has drastically changed. I’m an aggressive, defensive fighter. All the great boxers hold this same philosophy. Defense disguises offense in boxing and the very best are masters. After working with Dwayne, it’s been breakthrough after breakthrough. For the first time in my life, I’ve been learning how to fight.”
## Jorge Finds the Missing Tool
“If you’re not assessing, you’re guessing,” Jorge said to me. “What do you mean?” I asked. “If you’re not assessing how your training is affecting your recovery and how your recovery is affecting your training, then you’re guessing how well you’re going to perform.”
## “We finally have a tool that works. WHOOP gives me the predictive analytics that I trust.”
Dwayne and Jorge assess everything: his workload, his power, and his speed. However, the only thing that we haven’t been able to assess is Recovery. “Nobody measures Recovery. It’s been something we’ve needed for a long time. Then along came WHOOP – the one thing we’ve been looking for,” Jorge said.
“Typically in the past, if I wanted 8 hours of sleep I would go to bed at 12 and wake up at 8. After wearing WHOOP I now understand my sleeping patterns and how well I’m sleeping throughout the night. In the morning I know how many disturbances I have, what affected my sleep quality, and what my sleep latency was. This helps me understand how my Recovery will affect my performance. We finally have a tool that works. WHOOP gives me the predictive analytics that I trust.”",8/30/16
the-whoop-approach-to-measuring-sleep,The WHOOP Technology and Approach to Measuring Sleep,"## The Technology
WHOOP measures blood flow using a technology called Photoplethysmography (PPG). There are LEDs (light-emitting diodes) on the bottom of the strap that shine light into your skin, which is full of tiny capillaries. Blood in the capillaries absorbs more of the light than the tissue surrounding it. Specifically, the hemoglobins in blood absorb a particular wavelength of light. The light that isn’t absorbed is reflected back and received by a sensor called a photodiode, which is located between the LEDs. By observing the differences in light, WHOOP is able to track the changes in blood flow caused by each pulse, and in turn calculate your heart rate and heart rate variability.
The WHOOP Strap also contains a three-axis accelerometer that measures motion. The PPG and accelerometer data are plugged into an advanced algorithm that determines your sleep stages (for a deeper dive into the stages of sleep, take a look at the White Paper: (The Importance of Sleep Stage Tracking for Athletic Performance and Recovery). Unfortunately the algorithm is a trade secret, so we can’t get into the specifics of how it works. However, we can tell you about the process that went into creating it.",2/1/17
the-whoop-approach-to-measuring-sleep,The WHOOP Technology and Approach to Measuring Sleep,"Sleep Testing
About two years ago, WHOOP began running sleep tests on a wide variety of subjects. Among the early participants were company employees, college athletes, a Boston running club and other local volunteers.
Each subject visited a certified sleep lab and underwent an overnight sleep test known as a polysomnogram (PSG). Participants were instructed to do everything as they normally would leading up to the study. At the lab, they were each given a room to sleep for the night that resembled a boring hotel room. The rooms were dark, comfortable and optimized for ideal sleep temperature. Many subjects brought work, while others read books and watched movies before falling asleep.
The participants were outfitted with WHOOP Straps and numerous electrodes from the neck up to collect data for the PSG (pictured below via infrared video). They were then monitored by certified sleep technicians in an adjacent room for the entire night.
WHOOP data scientists trained our sleep staging algorithm by lining up the results of the PSGs with the data from the WHOOP Straps.
We’ve followed this format ever since, refining and improving the algorithm as more and more athletes have gone through our sleep study protocol. Each time the Strap’s hardware or signal processing technology has been updated, more testing has been done to ensure the continued accuracy of the algorithm’s sleep detection.

A study from the American Psychological Association found that 38% of people in the U.S. reported an increase in stress during the holidays. Shopping for the right gifts, worrying about expenses, fighting the constant crowds, finding time to get everything done, and dealing with in-laws are just a few of the many things that raise our stress levels–and stress is only the beginning.
From Thanksgiving through New Year’s, travel, unhealthy eating (not to mention the corresponding weight gain), additional alcohol consumption, and the general disruption of our normal day-to-day routines all impact our ability to perform at a high level.
Looking back at WHOOP data collected last year, we can see signs of these things taking their toll. For example, WHOOP users slept 3.5% less on average during Thanksgiving week a year ago than they did during a typical week in the past 12 months.

It’s no surprise that attempting to get a good night’s rest on an airplane can crush Recovery. However, even when we do manage to sleep a full eight hours in a comfortable bed, the quality of that Sleep can take it a hit when it’s in a new or unfamiliar place.
A 2016 sleep study at Brown University discovered that one side of the brain remained more alert than the other during the first night subjects slept in the lab. From Jon Hamilton of npr.org:
“The team measured something called slow-wave activity, which appears during deep sleep. And they found that during a student’s first night in the lab, slow wave activity was greater in certain areas of the right hemisphere than in the corresponding areas of the left hemisphere. After the first night, though, the difference went away.”

To no surprise, the metric we found impacted the most by outdoor time is strain–people are more active when they go outside. On average, day strain rises from 8.7 to 10.4 on days with logged outdoor time.
Despite the additional strain, there is no significant effect on sleep following reported outdoor time. However, heart rate variability decreases by 1 millisecond on average, while resting heart rate increases by 1 beat per minute (which both make sense when taking on extra strain).
Time outdoors increases WHOOP members’ strain and next-day recovery.
What is surprising and noteworthy is that even though outdoor time leads to added strain and slightly worse HRV and RHR, next-day recovery actually goes up–from an average of 58% to 59%.

tips-benefits-running-in-cold-weather,12 Tips & Benefits to Running in Cold Weather,"Sleep Performance and Recovery Matter
If you’re running in the cold, make sure it’s after a good night’s sleep. The correlation between rest and recovery undoubtedly affects performance in every single way–even more so when preparing to run in colder temperatures. I would highly recommend using WHOOP to track your sleep progress so you know which days your body is primed for a high strain. The more prepared you are to handle a workout, the stronger your performance, and recovery afterward, will be.
For instance, when your body is recovered, your reaction time while running is quicker (easier to avoid falling on ice patches and to navigate wind or other cold weather conditions), your risk of getting sick is lower, and you won’t exhaust as easily (run longer but with less effort).
As far as post-run recovery, you’re going to want to fuel up afterward (between 100-300g of carbs) which will aid your body in its ability to recover. I would also recommend foam rolling after you run so that you can avoid DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness). Having a strong recovery means you won’t be as sore, which means you’ll be more inclined to keep up the momentum to get outside in those colder temperatures again. No one likes being cold, but running on sore muscles in the cold can make it much worse.

If you think about it, feeling cold is essentially just a different type of pain, which makes you wonder, “Is it mental or physical?” Running in the cold isn’t impossible, it’s just not ideal. It requires both physical and mental strength. And with the chilliest months still underway, there’s no better time to be prepared than now.
You know that stiffness in your stride cycle, the nose drip, and that freezing feeling in your lungs? That’s all happening because it’s cold. And while I wish there were a way to change the weather, there isn’t. Running in the cold affects everyone differently. How our bodies adapt to it is a matter of preparation, acclimation and practice. Luckily, I have several tips to help you do that.
## Cold Weather Effects on Lungs
Our lungs don’t like running in the cold. That’s a fact. When cold air is breathed in, our lungs humidify it, warming it up so it can circulate more easily throughout the rest of our body. And as you can imagine, this process is more demanding on our respiratory systems when the temperature is at 32 instead of 62 degrees. The colder the air, the narrower our pathways become, yet our lungs are still required to continue to heat it up and circulate it. This process is what can cause that irritating, freezing feeling in your chest while running.",2/4/22
tips-benefits-running-in-cold-weather,12 Tips & Benefits to Running in Cold Weather,"One last thing to note–when you run in the cold, your body uses your glycogen storages (stored energy in the form of carbs) more quickly than it does when you run in warmer temperatures. Bringing gels or chews along with you on your run can help you replenish these storages before they run out. Stock up on carbs 24 hours before the run, and replenish your carbs before you’re empty (every 30-40 minutes of your run).

tips-benefits-running-in-cold-weather,12 Tips & Benefits to Running in Cold Weather,"Tips for Winter Running
One thing you can do to prepare your lungs for the cold is an indoor, dynamic warm-up prior to your run. Warming up (literally) will not only increase your muscle tissues’ temperature, but it will also reduce the effects of cold air on your lungs.
Another tip is to wear a mask. I know. We’re all tired of hearing it, but it’s not for pandemic related reasons, it’s because a mask or scarf can actually trap moisture and humidify the air more effectively than directly breathing in cold air.
An additional tip is to try breathing through your nose periodically instead of only through your mouth. Your nose’s pathway humidifies air more effectively than your mouth does.
And finally, start your winter training at the warmest points of the day (afternoon) if you can so you can acclimate your body and lungs before the temperatures really drop. Although your heart rate may be higher on your runs after having made some of these adjustments, you can monitor it with WHOOP and track how your body acclimates over time. It’s like running in higher elevations–the more you do it, the easier it gets.

tips-benefits-running-in-cold-weather,12 Tips & Benefits to Running in Cold Weather,"Heart Rate in Colder Weather
When the temperature drops, our blood vessels narrow which causes an increase in blood pressure and results in an elevated heart rate. And as WHOOP shows us, a higher heart rate leads to higher strain.
This is why your perceived effort at your “normal” pace in the cold may feel more difficult than it does in warmer temperatures. So how do we combat this?
There’s evidence that a particular type of fatty tissue, known as “brown fat,” may help the body generate heat in response to persistently cold conditions. “Chronic cold exposure somehow activates brown fat, which we know undergoes dramatic seasonal changes,” says Shingo Kajimura, a professor in the Department of Cell and Tissue Biology at the University of California, San Francisco.
The not-so-great news is that in order to develop more brown fat, you have to have repeated exposure to the cold. Where there is consistency, there is acclimation. You have to practice running in the cold, and not just once a week. You can also acclimate your body to the cold by increasing your amino acids intake from sports drinks, or in raw form, from foods like eggs and fish. Another (less favorable) option is to take a few 10-15 minute cold showers each week. I know, not fun.

tips-benefits-running-in-cold-weather,12 Tips & Benefits to Running in Cold Weather,"Fighting Depression
Running in the cold requires you to get outside your comfort zone. And I hate to say it, but there’s a lot of opportunity in getting comfortable with being uncomfortable. When your body prepares you for hard work, like running, it releases endorphins. So while it may not feel great running in the cold, that post-endorphin high can be exactly what your body needs to keep you coming back from more. As you run, the body releases norepinephrine, a chemical that moderates your brain’s response to stress. It increases your sense of well-being by pumping endorphins into your body’s system. If you’re consistent about running in the cold, it can help you eventually think less about the temperature, and more about how awesome you’re going to feel afterward.
With the conversation around mental health becoming more prevalent as we continue on through this pandemic, I can’t stress enough how important it is to take care of your body and mind. The cold weather doesn’t help you do this, but running does. Running with resilience can change the way you think about the sport. Endurance is all about your ability to “endure.” No matter how fast or slow you run, the only trait all consistent runners have in common is their ability to hang out in the pain cave just a little bit longer than they previously thought.

Here are some tips to stay safe and get the most out of summer running.
### 1. Acclimate to the Heat
1. Acclimate to the Heat
Acclimating to 130 degree temperatures was vital to Will Goodge during the Marathon des Sables, the 7-day ultra marathon across the Sahara Desert.
It can take a week or two to acclimate to hot weather. Acclimation can be done by spending an hour or two outdoors every day you’re going to workout. That means making adjustments so you’re not doing long or high-intensity workouts during the heat of the day. Running in the heat can be dangerous if you’re not used to it. Heat exhaustion and heat stroke are serious conditions that result in your body overheating. Pushing to the point of heat exhaustion will hurt rather than help your heat tolerance according to the CDC.

### 2. Slow Your Pace
2. Slow Your Pace
For most runners, perceived exertion increases and pace slows when the temperature rises above 59 degrees (15 degrees Celsius). This study found that runners averaging a 5:45-minute per mile pace or faster slow approximately 1 second per mile for every 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degree Fahrenheit) above 15 degrees. While slower runners (7:25 to 10-minute pace) slowed 4-4.5 seconds per mile for every degree Celsius above 15 degrees C. Male runners are more affected by high heat than female runners in general. Adjust your pace further if you find your heart rate is too high or your pace becomes uncomfortable.
### 3. Understand the Heat Index
3. Understand the Heat Index
The heat index, also called the apparent temperature, combines humidity with air temperature to gauge what the temperature feels like to humans. For example, when humidity is 70% a 90-degree (32 degrees Celsius) day can feel like 105 degrees (40 degrees Celsius). High humidity prevents your sweat from evaporating, and you can overheat quickly in these conditions.",7/11/22
tips-for-running-in-hot-weather,8 Tips for Running in Hot Weather,"6. Prehydrate, Carry Water, and Rehydrate
6. Prehydrate, Carry Water, and Rehydrate
You can lose up to 12 ounces (350 ml) of fluid and electrolytes such as sodium, potassium and magnesium in 20 minutes while running in hot weather. Even losing a small amount 1.5% of your body’s water can cause symptoms such as headache or even heatstroke.
When you’re dehydrated your total blood volume decreases, reducing blood flow to your skin and muscles. This can increase your heart rate, and impact your cognitive functions.
Anticipate your water needs by prehydrating. Drink about 2 cups (500 ml) of water or a sports beverage two hours before you plan to run and 6 to 8 ounces (175-250 ml) about 15 minutes before you begin. You want to drink enough so you prevent excessive dehydration, but not so much that you need to stop during your run to find a bathroom.
Most runners don’t drink enough during exercise, but if your run lasts more than an hour you should consider carrying a water bottle or a hydration belt, vest, or backpack.
Rehydrate after your run with a sports drink or water to replace your electrolyte deficit, especially if you run for more than an hour, to boost recovery and stay safe.
An analysis of WHOOP data shows that proper hydration is one of the best things our members do to improve their daily recovery.
### 7. Run in Early Mornings or Late Evenings
7. Run in Early Mornings or Late Evenings
Avoid the heat of the day, dehydration, and sunburn by running early in the day or in the evening. If you must run at midday, pick a route with some shade. Morning people who rise with the sun can usually avoid the heat, while evening runs can help wind down the day. Your muscles are usually looser than in the mornings and you’re less likely to injure yourself.",7/11/22

4. Dress for the Weather
Wear comfortable, loose-fitting shorts made from breathable fabric in hot weather.
Wear light-colored, loose-fitting clothing. This is not the time to wear your compression shirt or sweatpants. Loose tops and shorts will help your body breathe and cool itself. Tight clothing restricts that ability while dark colors absorb the sun’s light. The type of cloth is important, too. Cotton soaks up sweat and doesn’t allow it to evaporate quickly when you’re active. Synthetics wick away perspiration and dry quickly allowing you to stay cool. Clothing that has vents or mesh can also help you to stay cool.
### 5. Protect Your Skin
5. Protect Your Skin
During the summer, the sun’s ultraviolet rays are at their strongest between 10 am and 4 pm. Avoid exposure to direct sunlight during those hours, or take precautions to protect your skin. Wear a light-colored hat or visor to block the sun’s rays and keep sweat from dripping into your eyes, and wear sunglasses to protect your eyes. Some high-tech clothing can block ultraviolet rays, but you should also wear sunblock with a rating of at least SPF 30 and reapply every two hours and after sweating. Sunburns aren’t just painful; they also increase your risk for melanoma.",7/11/22

If you need caffeine, be aware of how late in the morning you keep drinking a cup of coffee. Dr. Meeta Singh said on the WHOOP Podcast that caffeine can affect people differently and while it wakes you up, it has drawbacks, too.
“The problem is, there are studies that show it does not affect your decision making. You’re just making decisions faster because you’re all caffeinated up. Caffeine may make you anxious, it may make you jittery or it may make you hyper. There is variability. Some people are fast metabolizers, some people are slow metabolizers, typically the half-life of caffeine is about 4-5 hours.”
### 6. Eat breakfast
6. Eat breakfast
Breakfast starts up your metabolism for the day. Eating breakfast gives you the energy to focus and get things done. Not to mention, it can lower levels of LDL cholesterol and decrease the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease.
Some people don’t like to eat first thing in the morning. They may be fasting or just not hungry. In that case, a mid-morning snack like yogurt or a smoothie might be a better option. You could also try reducing the size of your evening meal and eating dinner earlier so you’re hungry in the morning.
Dr. Stacy Sims said she is not a believer in intermittent fasting, particularly for women. “We’re so unconditioned to meal timing. Whereas if you were to eat a proper dinner and then stop and then not eat again until breakfast, that’s a good fast.”",4/15/22

Once you’re up and caffeinated, getting in a short activity before heading to your daily routine can relieve anxiety and make you feel better about yourself. Writing a stream-of-consciousness journal may help you organize your thoughts, release anxiety, and think about dreams you remember from the night. Some of the world’s top athletes use journaling in the morning or at night to express gratitude or to fight self-doubt.
World and Olympic long jump champion Malaika Mihambo told the WHOOP Podcast that journaling before and during competitions helps her feel more confident.
“I was exhausted from the tension I had from the fear of losing (before the finals in Japan) … I wrote much down to get rid of those feelings. I was really cheering myself, that I was pushing, that I will be good. That I will take the strength from the first competition from the qualification and put that and the good feeling I had there into the final and that I know what I have to do and that I will do it, and I’m going to do it.”
If you’re not a writer, meditation may provide the same benefits to you. Meditation can reduce stress, support your ability to focus on one task at a time, and make you more aware of your own thoughts. It can also improve resting heart rate and HRV.

This sounds difficult. We all have busy lives. Kids, jobs, school, commutes, paying the bills, keeping our homes clean, and watching the daily news can all add up to a stressful life. Even vacation can be stressful. But reducing stress doesn’t necessarily mean limiting the things we need to do. Try a short mindfulness session while you’re waiting for the kids, or 4-7-8 breathing on your commute. A few minutes of either can lower your heart rate and decrease anxiety. Just make sure you don’t fall asleep at the wheel.
### 2. Get Enough Sleep

Sleep not only helps our brains function, it also helps heart health. Getting the right amount of sleep helps the body repair itself and allows us to function during our waking hours, the CDC says. Adults who get less than seven hours of sleep are more likely to have health issues that can increase the risk of heart disease, heart attacks and strokes.
When we sleep, our blood pressure decreases, but if we don’t get enough sleep, blood pressure remains higher for a longer period of time. Some studies show that getting enough sleep may help improve blood sugar control in people with Type 2 diabetes. Lack of sleep can also lead to weight gain, especially in children and teenagers. It also may affect the part of the brain that controls hunger.

3. Exercise
The heart is a muscle and exercise will strengthen it. Try to get at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise five days a week. If you’re not used to exercise, do the simple things first, like going for a walk. A 30-minute walk at a brisk pace of about 100 steps per minute or 3-3.5 miles per hour can raise your heart rate into the aerobic zone and the length will help you burn fat and improve your aerobic fitness. Additional cardio, such as cycling, jogging or swimming also increases your heart’s fitness and helps you lose weight.
Resistance training is good for people carrying extra body fat, a risk factor for heart disease. A mix of aerobic exercise and resistance training may help raise HDL (good) cholesterol and lower LDL (bad) cholesterol. Doing at least two nonconsecutive days per week of strength training is a good place to start, according to the American College of Sports Medicine.

6. Plan Your Meals
Meal planning does not mean making drastic changes to your diet. It also doesn’t mean you have to watch your macros, although you can certainly begin to track macronutrients to help you learn what different foods contain.
Diet changes are hard to maintain. A better option is planning your meals for the week and making your shopping list based on healthy choices that you and your family enjoy. Limit red meat to one meal a week and increase the amount of fish or shellfish you eat. Scheduling a meatless day with a vegetable main dish can help you learn which vegetables you like and which you do not. Plan dinners and lunches around vegetables and foods rich in dietary fiber such as brown rice or quinoa, and breakfasts to include oatmeal with berries and scrambled egg breakfast burritos with avocado and tomato in a whole grain wrap.
Make a big batch of your family favorites for each meal and freeze them for those days when you’re running late or running ragged.
Plan your snacks too. Nut butters go great with raw veggies or sliced apples at school. Add a handful of unsalted mixed nuts and dried unsweetened fruit to your work lunch. A bowl of nuts in their shells provides the activity of cracking shells that can help slow or prevent mindless eating in front of the TV.
### 7. Eat Less Salt

“The Tour de France is arguably the pinnacle of endurance sport performance. WHOOP has allowed us to quantify both the strain and daily recovery of some of the fittest athletes in the world, and the numbers are impressive,” said Kevin Sprouse, Head of Medicine for EF Pro Cycling.
The EF squad finished 4th out of 22 teams at the 2020 Tour de France, and was the top team overall for 7 of the race’s 21 stages.
Below we’ll share many of the insights gained from monitoring these athletes’ physiological data while competing in one of the most grueling events in sports.
## 3 Weeks of All-Out Strain
WHOOP quantifies the strain (cardiovascular load) your body takes on each day on a 0-21 scale. Through the Tour’s 21 stages (which spanned just 23 days total with only a pair of days off), the EF riders posted average day strains of 20 or more 13 times. Additionally, on other days they averaged 19.5, 19.4, 19.2, 18.8 and 18.0 (see graphic below).
To put that into perspective, WHOOP classifies anything above 18 as an “all-out” effort, meaning the EF athletes basically pushed themselves to the limit nearly every time they got on the bike, for 3 weeks straight.
It’s also important to note that the WHOOP strain metric is highly individualized–so if an elite athlete and an average athlete do the same thing, the activity will almost certainly cause less strain for the better athlete. Considering that the EF riders are among the most physically fit humans on the planet (with the ability to take on significantly more cardiovascular load than the average person), the fact that they still put up strains in the 20s on a regular basis is somewhat mind-boggling.
THE AVERAGE DAILY WHOOP STRAIN AND RECOVERY FOR EF RIDERS DURING THE 2020 TOUR DE FRANCE.",9/25/20

Another indication of just how hard these riders pushed themselves is the amount of time they spent at close to their max heart rate.
For example, in Stage 8, Neilson Powless was on the bike for a little more than 4 hours. His average heart rate was 165 bpm, and he spent 51% of the time at 80-90% of his max heart rate. Amazingly, he was in the 90-100% of max heart rate zone for 38% of the stage, or 1 hour and 35 minutes.
## The Power of Sleep
After crushing themselves on the road all day, effective sleep is obviously an essential aspect of recovery. Powless, in particular, was spectacular at this. The team averaged just shy of 8 hours per night during the Tour, however Powless regularly got about half an hour more than his teammates did.
On the night of the race’s second rest day (between Stages 15 and 16), Powless got just over 9 hours of sleep. He also spent 5:51 (a whopping 64% of his time asleep) in what we call the “restorative stages” of sleep (REM and deep sleep). People usually only spend about 40-45% of their sleep time in these stages when the body repairs itself.
Similarly, following the first rest day, Powless slept for 7:59 and spent 5:02 in REM and deep sleep (63%). This helped him achieve a 92% recovery the next morning.

tour-de-france-cycling-strain-rhr-hrv,How Strenuous is the Tour de France? Plus Other Biometric Data Insights,"Phenomenal Resting Heart Rate and HRV
Curious just how fit the EF team is? On the day the Tour began, the team members’ average resting heart rate was 42 beats per minute (the American Heart Association says that anything between 60 and 100 bpm is normal to push the standard amount of oxygen through your bloodstream), and their average heart rate variability was 139 milliseconds (the average HRV for all WHOOP members is 64 ms).
As the Tour progressed, it naturally took a toll on these impressive metrics. After the first week, the team’s average RHR had risen to 51 bpm, and its average HRV had dropped to 73 ms. However, it took just one day of rest for these numbers to bounce back. Following the riders’ day off prior to Stage 10, the EF team’s average RHR and HRV were actually better than they were before the race began, at 40 bpm and 152 ms, respectively.
The team also averaged a 90% WHOOP recovery (a measure of the body’s readiness to take on strain) after the first rest day, better than the 73% on the morning of Stage 1.
## Incredible Recovery
It’d be natural to assume that day after day of all-out strain would significantly hurt the team’s recovery each morning, but that was not the case with the EF riders.
“I’ve seen lots of 20.7 [strains],” said Sprouse, “rarely is it lower than 20. What’s just as amazing is the fact that recovery scores tend to be good as well, often 55% and higher. That is a huge testament to the amazing staff we have supporting these guys at the Tour. From the finish line to bedtime, everything is set up to encourage recovery so that they can perform again the following day.”
In fact, over the entire 23-day Tour, the team’s average daily recovery never dipped into the red (33% and below). Amazingly, it even stayed in the green (67% and higher) 4 times following stages where the average strain was 20+ (see above).",9/25/20

Time trials are dubbed “the race against the clock,” which is a short (usually under 60 minutes) but constantly hard individual effort. The strain we see is different from any other days of a Grand Tour. If the riders pace it right, their heart rates will be lower at the beginning and progressively go up and up to the finish line.
When you factor in what they do to warm up and cool down it can still end up being a “big day”–especially considering riders often need to finish within a certain time percentage of the winner in order to stay in the race. They can’t go out there and lallygag even for a moment, they have to keep moving even if they’re not in the hunt for the overall or stage win.
Lawson completed Stage 20 of the 2018 Tour (a 31-mile time trial) in just under 48 minutes, and his day strain still topped 16. Similarly, Simon hit a strain of 16.6 at the Giro’s Stage 21 time trial this year, despite being on the bike for only 18+ miles and 36 minutes. However, he spent 33 of those 36 minutes at 80% or more of his max heart rate, with his HR rarely dipping below 160 bpm the entire time.

If we look at the last time we visited this stage, we actually have data from Lawson Craddock in 2018. Back then, it was Stage 10 of the 2018 Tour de France. To give you a sense of things during that moment, at the time Lawson said this to us:
“It was a rough day for me. I felt better than expected on the first climb, but that feeling was short lived. I suffered over the second mountain pass, but once we hit Col de Romme I was cooked.”
Lawson had a solid 70% WHOOP recovery that day with a 20.6 strain, his most strenuous stage of the Tour to that point. His average heart rate for the ride was 146 beats per minute, his max heart rate was 183 bpm (near his top) and he burned around 4,600 calories/KJ.
To use another example, Stage 6 of this year’s Giro d’Italia was also a very similar alpine stage–100 miles, roughly 5 hours of riding and 11,200 feet of climbing. Here’s a glimpse at some of EF rider Simon Carr’s metrics from that stage:
Recovery: 25% Day Strain: 20.5 Average HR: 145 bpm (nearly identical to Lawson’s mentioned above)
Recovery: 25% Day Strain: 20.5 Average HR: 145 bpm (nearly identical to Lawson’s mentioned above)

Now that we’ve seen what a day in the mountains looks like, let’s crunch a little data from some flat stages. These stages of a Grand Tour tend to be “easier” relative to what the riders are doing on the hillier days. Here’s a snippet of what we wrote during the 2018 Tour:
“Lawson completed Stage 07 today, spending more than six hours on the bike. It was a long, mostly flat stage referred to as ‘boring’ by a few riders.”
This is less true on days when certain riders have to “ride in the front” for the team’s sprinter or “get in the breakaway,” so let’s exclude those and just focus on a typical flat stage from someone who’s “sitting in the bunch.”
At the Giro this year, the 13th stage was 126 miles long and flat as a pan. Simon Carr only burned 2700 calories/KJ with a WHOOP day strain of 15.9. This is an atypical stage of a Grand Tour, but it highlights just how different each day can be. Also, towards the end of these flatter stages it’s often very chaotic and dangerous as they come into the finish line, and it gets going fast.
Looking at Simon’s heart rate data from this stage, you can see that he is full gas in the last 30-45 minutes and maxed out his HR just to finish in the pack.

For 21 stages spanning 23 days, cyclists push their bodies to the max–day, after day, after day, after day. How hard are the various individual stages?
We wanted to take a look at data we’ve been able to capture over the years from the big stages of the Tour de France, as well as the Giro d’Italia, another Grand Tour stage race that is three weeks long. We can use this data to better understand the incredible effort that these riders will undertake at this year’s Tour de France.
## The Strain and Exertion of Tour de France Stages
Generally speaking, a “normal” day at the Tour has a rider putting out somewhere around 230-250 watts on average (think of this as pressure on the pedals), which equates to about 900 kilojoules (a fancy way to say calories) per hour. Multiply that by 5 hours and it’s almost 5000 calories! And more often than not, this equates to a WHOOP strain score above 20 (strain is how we measure cardiovascular exertion, on a scale of 0-21).
On some of the harder stages, this is closer to 300+ watts and 1100 calories/KJ per hour. Even for the fittest athletes in the world, this is a wild number and gets your cardiovascular system really fatigued. Strains over 20.5 are not uncommon.

track-macronutrients-efficient-shopping-nutrition,Track Macronutrients to Be More Efficient with Your Shopping & Nutrition,"## What are Macronutrients (Macros)?
Macronutrients are the nutrients we need an abundance of every single day. They are categorized as proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Each of these play major roles in fueling and constructing the human body. As we start to understand which foods fall under which category, it’s important to know the classification is based on the primary molecule in that food. For example, brazil nuts consist of protein and fat molecules but are classified as a fat source. This is because brazil nuts are primarily made of fats.
## Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are made of carbon and water. Hence, the two parts of the word: carbo – and hydrate. Carbs are our main source of energy. They are stored in our muscles and organs as glycogen. In the form of fiber, carbohydrates help provide fuel for our microbiome too. They are found in vegetables, fruits, tubers, legumes, grains and sweeteners.
Whole Food sources: Plantains, Banana, Grapes, Nectarines, Apples, Berries, Black Bean pasta, Lentil pasta, Quinoa, Parsnips, Winter Squashes, Carrots, Green zucchini, Yellow squash, Kale, Spinach, Brussel sprouts, Broccoli, Cauliflower, Rice, Rolled oats, White potato, Sweet potato, Japanese yams

Proteins are made of amino acids and are the building blocks for tissues, organs, nerves, muscles and more. There are over 50,000 different proteins in the human body! Protein does more than create tissue. It is also an essential component for enzymes, antibodies, hemoglobin and peptide hormones. It repairs broken down muscle fibers post exercise, makes sure you have the right cofactors for metabolic processes, and contributes to your adaptive immune system. Protein is the primary nutrient for animal meats, seafood, and some legumes.

track-macronutrients-efficient-shopping-nutrition,Track Macronutrients to Be More Efficient with Your Shopping & Nutrition,"Fats
Contrary to popular belief, dietary fat is not the villain it’s made out to be. Fat is essential for optimal health and performance. Fats are made up of fatty acid molecules. They play numerous important roles in the body: Energy source, cell building blocks for cells, hormones, and increase satiety. They regulate inflammation too!
There are three classifications of fats: Saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated.
Saturated fats are highly stable, don’t rancify easily, and are solid at room temperature. These are great to use for cooking!
Saturated fats are highly stable, don’t rancify easily, and are solid at room temperature. These are great to use for cooking!
Monounsaturated fats are relatively stable, don’t rancify easily, and are liquid at room temperature.
Monounsaturated fats are relatively stable, don’t rancify easily, and are liquid at room temperature.
Polyunsaturated fats are relatively unstable, go rancid easily, and always liquid. Never heat or use polyunsaturated fats in cooking!
Polyunsaturated fats are relatively unstable, go rancid easily, and always liquid. Never heat or use polyunsaturated fats in cooking!
Trans fats, on the other hand, are a by-product of the hydrogenation process. Hydrogenation is the man-made manipulation of unsaturated fats. These fats are toxic and interfere with the essential roles fatty acids play within a healthy body. Avoid vegetable oils, fried fats, canola oil, margarine, and vegetable shortening.

track-macronutrients-efficient-shopping-nutrition,Track Macronutrients to Be More Efficient with Your Shopping & Nutrition,"Why Counting Macros Can Be Important
At M2 Performance Nutrition, we believe counting and tracking macronutrients is a powerful short-term tool that shows you what is in the food you eat and how well your metabolism responds to it. Since nutrition needs a bio-individual approach, tracking is a great way to understand what foods work well for you. Macro tracking also guides you to control portions whether you are looking to gain, maintain, or lose weight. It sets you up for success to kick start your goal and learn how to continue it in the long run. My job as a nutrition coach is to help you get started, learn tools to support your optimized health, and tweak your macronutrients (and micronutrients too!) based on a variety of feedback points.
## How Can I Find My Macros?
When I work with athletes, I start with their goals first. Then we calculate your protein macronutrient target. As a guideline, start within 0.75 – 1.0 grams of protein per desired body weight. Next, depending on your activity level, calculate your carbohydrate macro target to be between 35-45% of daily calories. From there, your fat target becomes the remaining calories. Using your WHOOP as your personal guide to activity level and overall calorie expenditure is a good check point for your macro calculations. If you are looking to streamline your goals, head over to M2 Performance Nutrition Personalized Plans to get specialized macros targets and macro adjustments designed by our team of experts.",4/3/20
track-macronutrients-efficient-shopping-nutrition,Track Macronutrients to Be More Efficient with Your Shopping & Nutrition,"How Can I Apply Macros to When I’m Buying Food at the Grocery Store?
If you fail to plan, you plan to fail! Before heading to the store, make a list of 2-3 lean protein sources, 2-3 fatty protein sources, 3-6 different colored vegetables, 2 starch sources, nuts, seeds, cooking oils, and your favorite snacks. Your macros guide how much food from each category you need. Nutrition labels on the back of meat packages, goods, and produce give the breakdown of macronutrients per serving. You can simply utilize these labels to determine weekly food needs. It may take a little trial and error at first but that’s part of the process!
Start with whole food sources by sticking to the perimeter of the store and then head down your favorite snack aisles.
Specialized macronutrient tracking with quality food choices will positively impact your WHOOP recovery, resting heart rate, and sleep quality (these anecdotal observations suggest this nutritional approach may improve heart rate variability as well). It may take a few weeks for your body to adjust, but you should start to see a positive correlation around the 4-5 week mark of your new macro targets.

In June 2022, Alex had his lowest Recovery ever – 1% – after the grueling Unbound Gravel race, the biggest gravel cycle event in the U.S., during which he was unknowingly fighting COVID-19.
Alex had been traveling extensively before the event and didn’t feel well, but decided to race anyway after taking 7 negative COVID tests. While his daily data indicated something was amiss, when reviewing his 1-month data trends, he could see exactly when COVID hit, and how long it took for his body to fully recover after battling the illness.
The combination of Alex’s 1% Recovery, a low personal HRV of 21 (ms) HRV, and a high 20.7 strain knocked Alex out for almost a month before he returned to his baseline – all visible in his trend views, especially in his Recovery, with a noticeable uptick in lower-than-average yellow and red Recoveries post-race and post-illness.

As you get fitter, you’ll likely notice your resting heart rate decreasing. A lower resting heart rate is a sign that your heart muscle can pump a greater amount of blood, and as a result, doesn’t need to beat as frequently. When your heart is strong and doesn’t need to work as hard to push blood throughout the body to deliver oxygen to your muscles, your fitness improves.
Increases or decreases in your heart rate variability (HRV) can be signs of overall improvements to your fitness, or that you could be sick, dehydrated, or something else. High heart rate variability means your parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system is balanced – which means your body is ready and able to take on more strenuous activities. Lower heart rate variability is a sign that your parasympathetic nervous system and sympathetic nervous system are not balanced, which could mean your body is working hard because you’re sick, dehydrated, fatigued, or even overtraining.
Changes to your activity Strain can be a sign of improving fitness. Strain is calculated by looking at your heart rate. The higher your heart rate and the longer it stays elevated means a higher Strain. As your body adapts and your fitness improves, your Strain scores will likely decrease",1/5/23

It’s no secret that training at elevation can improve fitness and performance. However, by monitoring data 24/7 with WHOOP, David was able to get more detailed information than ever before.
Below is a chart that outlines David’s baseline WHOOP metrics (pulled from a 30-day average), his first week at altitude, and his last weeks at altitude. The chart shows a clear trajectory of ups and downs largely influenced by the changes in oxygen levels.DAVID’S BODY WEEK 1 IN ALTITUDE:
We already know altitude exposure is associated with major changes in cardiovascular function including increased heart rate and blood pressure, and a reduction of hemoglobin saturation. Week 1 of altitude resulted in a higher resting heart rate (RHR), lower heart rate variability (HRV), and lower recovery averages, which meant his body was working harder to get back to baseline. Notice a higher average strain, despite not changing his running routine the first week home.
Sleep was greatly impacted for David. Altitude can disrupt sleep causing frequent awakenings and sleep fragmentation. This can lead to fatigue the next day. David doubled his number of sleep disturbances and got far more light sleep than usual.
David’s respiratory rate (RR) increased by 1 breath on average during that first week, which may seem marginal, but is statistically significant since resting RR does not fluctuate often day to day. Changes in respiratory rate are usually related to meaningful changes in physiology.",5/15/20

When David Perry flew from New York City to his parents’ rural home in Boulder, CO back in March, he had no idea what the next 7 weeks had in store. This was right before NYC became the national epicenter for the coronavirus outbreak; nobody knew anything, but everybody knew it was going to get a lot worse. So David packed his bags, booked a one-way flight home, and told his parents he’d be self-quarantining for 14 days. A day later, Governor Andrew Cuomo issued a statewide mandate ordering closure of all schools and non-essential businesses.
Perry, a Boulder native, grew up running on the empty farm roads at 5,328 feet elevation. Like most unassuming high schoolers searching to belong, he found running after being “just OK” at all the other sports. Years later he became a high school state champion, a conference champion at a Division I school, and a podium finisher with his team at NCAA cross-country championships. His all-time PRs of 13:58 in the 5k and 28:42 in the 10k solidified him as one of the top sub-elite US runners–those just in reach of making an Olympic standard.
On March 17th, he arrived in Boulder without much of a plan. Back in NYC, he was a multitude of things: the head captain of Adidas Runners NYC, an entrepreneur with his own jewelry and apparel lines, and a competitive runner occasionally lining up with the pros. Now, all of that was put on hold as he sought to find purpose in a world turned upside down. No more metro rides to the Diamond District in Midtown, no more track sessions with friends at McCarren park, no more late nights beneath the luminescence of New York City marquees.",5/15/20

The running world and sports in general have lost so much this year. The Olympics. The Boston Marathon. NCAA championships. It’s been devastating to be without so many of these things that unite us. While athletes’ dreams have been postponed, this indefinite pause has not been wasted. Like so many runners out there, David has used this time to ask himself the tough questions: What comes next in life, and how do I achieve it?
After 7 weeks away from the city, David has returned home with a new vision. The passions are still the same, but the execution will be a little different this time around.

If Phase 1 of quarantine was about acceptance, then Phase 2 was about finding ways to stay active and develop a routine. People asked themselves, What now? How will we cope? How will our mental and physical health be altered?
For runners like David with a competitive spirit, the “What now?” question was simple. Run more, get fit, and plan for the next race that wasn’t canceled. And in a beautiful, spacious landscape full of dirt trails, it honestly wasn’t all that bad. It was exactly what he needed to set new goals, refocus, and get back to the basics. “Normal” life was stripped away, leaving room for mental and physical acuity. David used WHOOP to help him.
David became a WHOOP member a few months ago when he heard about it through his Adidas network. The tool was unlike anything he’d ever used as a runner. He had years of experience logging miles in Strava and tallying splits on his GPS watch, but he’d never used technology that’s sole purpose was monitoring stress adaptation and recovery. This was new. He didn’t have to stare down at a number, a pace, or dinging notifications. Much like his transition from sea level to altitude during the time of a pandemic, wearing WHOOP was about removing distractions and honing in on improving performance.
“I was excited to use WHOOP,” he says. “I thought it could help me understand the strain I was putting on my body running more miles with higher intensity as I always do when I head home to Colorado.”
With nothing else to do but increase mileage and train, David used WHOOP to make sure he was recovering properly and not digging himself into a hole.",5/15/20

We’ve been incredibly close for such a long time that it’s forced each of us to step our game up and ultimately get better and better. Chris has been around a little longer than I have, but we’ve both progressed and won World Cup medals at the same time. Our dynamic has really helped motivate us to get to the next level.”
The month ahead
We spoke to Tucker on January 3. Here’s what he had to say about his training and preparation for the final month before the Olympics begin:
“For the next week, we’re still in the high-Strain building phase. Then after that, we’ll start to taper down until the Olympics. We actually have four World Cup races coming up, so we’re just kind of doing the normal thing. However, we’re not going all-out for these races because we want to push through and be at peak form the Olympics. We’re kind of training through them to be Recovered and potentiated for PyeongChang, the end goal.”
The first of those four races was on January 7. As you can see below, Tucker cut back his Strain (blue) prior to the competition and boosted his Recovery (green) to 93% on race day:
Goal for PyeongChang
What does Tucker hope to accomplish at his second Olympic games? “Honestly, the goal is to just have four clean runs and race a good race,” he said. “And hopefully if I do that, the results will follow.”
Over the next few weeks, we’ll take a closer look both Tucker and Chris’ WHOOP data as they strive to optimize performance heading into the PyeongChang games.

‘Ultimate Sledding’ – 9 Questions with Team USA’s Chris Mazdzer
“My Quest for Glory on the Sled” by Kendall Wesenberg, Team USA Skeleton",1/16/18
tucker-west-prepares-for-his-second-olympic-games,"From the Backyard to the Olympics, Literally - Tucker West's Story","“Recovery is a really big thing for me, obviously it doesn’t feel very good when you crash at 90 miles per hour,” Tucker said. “Gone are the days when you can just say ‘Man, I’m sore today, maybe I should take it easy’ or ‘I feel great, let’s go max out in the weight room.’ Now we have data to back that up. The WHOOP Recovery metric has really helped me hone in on what methods help my body recover faster–whether it’s a soft tissue roll out with foam rollers or tennis balls directly after a workout, a series of stretches later in the evening, a contrast bath on certain days, or even the timing and quantity of fluid intake before bed. WHOOP can pick up on these small changes in routine and show me what is the most effective.”
In particular, Tucker noted that hydration and getting to bed early are key elements in improving his next-day Recovery.
Teammates/rivals
We asked Tucker about his relationship with fellow Team USA luger Chris Mazdzer, another avid WHOOP user. What is it like to be teammates in a sport where athletes compete only as individuals? Is there a rivalry?
“Chris and I have trained together for a long time. We kind of are rivals and we’re competitors for sure, but at the end of the day we’re teammates and we want to help each other out as much as we can. We share lines down the track, we share sled setups, we try to make each other as fast as possible. The cool thing about the two of us is that we’re so close to the same skill level, so we kind of drive each other. We’re often only hundredths of a second apart in races.”
Today was a great day for Team USA!!! I came away with a second place, while @mazdzer earned the win! Now onto Park City for World Cup number 3! Congrats to all of the competitors today! #TeamUSA #USALuge #GoUSA

“Offseason” training
Olympic luge training is a year-round endeavor, but it varies widely from season to season.
“Much of what we do is very similar to other athletes,” Tucker said. “We’re a power based sport so we do a lot of weight-room activity–the Olympic lifts, the power clean and snatch, that sort of thing. The start of a run is the only point when you can physically accelerate yourself on the track, so that’s a huge aspect of our training. That’s our focus in the summer, then in the winter we shift over to sliding.”
“We’re at the level where we need every little bit of training to help push ourselves to the top,” Tucker added. “I use WHOOP as a tool to know the analytics of my body and how it’s performing. One of the metrics we rely on heavily is the Day Strain. If it gets too high over a certain period of time we’ll throttle back on training. As a team, we’ve actually noticed a pretty significant decrease in minor overuse and wear-and-tear injuries because of this. Lugers tend to have a lot of shoulder, wrist and back injuries since the nature of our sport is so impactful on those joints. This past summer, those nagging injuries definitely decreased, which allowed us to train much more efficiently.”
Recovery",1/16/18
tucker-west-prepares-for-his-second-olympic-games,"From the Backyard to the Olympics, Literally - Tucker West's Story","“My family and I have always kind of been Olympic nerds,” Tucker West told us. “Every time they’re on, we watch non-stop from the opening to closing ceremonies, we absolutely love it. I first saw luge when I was seven years old during the 2002 games in Salt Lake City. It just seemed so cool to me. I was always a speed demon as a child, I was that kid who would ski straight down the mountain. And I loved sledding, so luge was just a natural fit. It was extreme sledding.”
“From then on, I started pretending to be a luger,” Tucker explained. “Whenever there was snow, I’d drag out my flexible flyer or plastic sled and hurtle myself down the steepest hill I could find. But, I quickly realized that still wasn’t fast enough for me. Eventually, my dad came up with this hair-brained idea to built our own luge track in the backyard. Over the course of 2-3 months one summer, we prototyped it, got all the supplies at the hardware store, then constructed this monstrosity behind our house. At its longest, the wooden track was about 800 feet and let me get up to speeds of about 25-30 miles per hour. That was how I got my first taste of luge.”
By the time he was nine, Tucker was traveling with his father to Lake Placid on weekends to experience the real thing. “I just absolutely fell in love with it,” he said.
Fast forward to the 2014 winter games in Sochi, and an 18-year-old Tucker was the youngest Olympic luger in United States history. Now 22, Tucker will be back representing Team USA at the 2018 games in PyeongChang next month.
It’s official, I qualified for my second Olympic Team!! I’m so grateful for the opportunity, and I can’t wait to go show the world what Team USA is made of! . . With a bronze medal performance and an Olympic nomination, this will definitely be a weekend to remember. I can’t express how thankful I am to everyone that came out to support and cheer, there’s really nothing like racing at home! . . #TeamUSA #USALuge #qualified #Olympics #PyeongChang2018",1/16/18
types-of-stress,Three Types of Stress—and How to Find Relief,"Feeling stressed? You’re not alone. Everyone around the world experiences stress regularly.
Per The American Institute of Stress, Americans score 20 percentage points higher in stress levels than the average in other countries measured, with up to 55% of Americans reporting feeling stressed at least once during their day.
But residents of other countries are certainly not feeling stress-free today, either. And while there are different types of stress, including some good stress, the overall data is clear: Everyone could benefit from stress reduction to live better.
While it’s important to note that stress is not all bad and may sometimes be good, learning to manage it and mitigate it will enhance your overall emotional and physical health and well-being, which is why WHOOP created Stress Monitor. Stress Monitor is designed to help you recognize your unique stress triggers, and provide you with techniques on how to manage them.
Here are the types of stress that warrant a response and a deeper investigation into what’s happening in your body and mind:",4/24/23
types-of-stress,Three Types of Stress—and How to Find Relief,"Episodic Acute Stress
Frequent episodes of acute stress are known as episodic acute stress. During this experience, your body repeatedly releases the stress hormones cortisol and adrenaline, spiking your blood pressure and heart rate.
In addition to the cardiovascular and endocrine systems, the American Psychological Association notes, your musculoskeletal and respiratory systems are also negatively impacted by stress. It’s easy to understand how constant acute stress may lead to long-term health concerns, not just in those moments of distress and tension but potentially causing lasting damage.
Experiencing acute stress over and over again can lead to a state of chronic stress. Certain professions are more likely to experience episodic acute stress, including first responders, firefighters, emergency medical services and police officers, per the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). But individuals grappling with any past, present or repeated traumas, those caring for a chronically ill family member, or those feeling tremendous financial or professional pressure for years may suffer too.
### Chronic Stress
If you’re suffering from stress that you feel will not go away or dissipate, you might be dealing with chronic stress. This type of stress causes our bodies to overproduce two hormones, adrenaline and cortisol, which can very quickly lead to more than just a state of burnout and cause you to experience:
Intense bouts of anxiety
Depression
Insomnia
High blood pressure
A weakened immune system
Muscle pain
Chronic stress can feel overwhelming and even debilitating. It may at times, affect nearly every aspect of life. It can be caused by any event that has a long-standing impact on your mind or your life, most notably life-altering events like divorce, losing a loved one, losing a home or job, or an environmental disaster. But chronic stress may also result from constant episodes of acute stress that build up over time.",4/24/23
types-of-stress,Three Types of Stress—and How to Find Relief,"The Three Types of Stress
The American Psychological Association defines stress in terms of three categories:
Acute stress
Episodic acute stress
Chronic stress
### Acute Stress
Acute stress is the type of stress you’re likely most familiar with and experience most often. As the name suggests, acute stress is hyperintense and mostly short-lived. This type of stress is triggered by brief episodes of perceived threats to your safety or a general sense of wellness, for example, if you’ve lost all your files right before a critical presentation or are nearly hit by a car while crossing the street.
Acute stress is something most of us can’t avoid; it’s our body’s natural reaction to new and/or unexpected events. There’s nothing wrong with the right amount of acute stress. It may even be beneficial when you break out of your comfort zone and learn a new skill, push yourself in a new and unfamiliar direction, or experience a significant change in your life.",4/24/23
types-of-stress,Three Types of Stress—and How to Find Relief,"Practice breathwork
Deep breathing exercises can help regulate your sympathetic nervous system by activating a part known as the parasympathetic nervous system, which is in charge of our relaxation response. According to a recent WHOOP study on members that tracked stress and breathwork, breathwork positively impacted recovery when reported on a day when users also experienced stress.
The breathing sessions available with Stress Monitor experience can help mediate symptoms of stress by boosting mood, lowering anxiety, and decreasing respiratory rates. To help you regulate and calm your stress, WHOOP walks you through two helpful breathing protocols: increase relaxation (cyclic sigh) and alertness (cyclic hyperventilation).
### Cut down on screen time
WHOOP is strictly screen-free for a reason—No Screens. No Distractions. Just Science. Overdosing on screen time has been clinically detrimental to overall health and wellness.
As noted in one study published in the journal BMC Psychiatry, a strong correlation between the overuse of smartphones and higher rates of stress and depression also exists. Another recent study found that too much screen time can hurt a person’s ability to sleep well—both in quantity (hours) and quality (REM sleep), and poor sleep is directly linked to increased stress in the body, too.",4/24/23
types-of-stress,Three Types of Stress—and How to Find Relief,"Good Stress
Yes, good stress also exists. Biologically, stress is the body’s natural response to a perceived social, emotional, or physical threat. Known as the “fight or flight” response, stress can be a wake-up call to action—be it in a dangerous situation or removing ourselves from a toxic relationship or work environment. Stress serves to keep us safe or motivate us to improve our lives in some way. Stress in the body, for example, from surgery or vaccination, can also lead to a stronger immune response.",4/24/23
types-of-stress,Three Types of Stress—and How to Find Relief,"How to manage stress
Stress might be a normal physiological reaction, but learning to recognize and manage it often feels like no small task. Here are some tested tips to better manage your stress levels anytime.
### Get moving
Regular exercise significantly reduces some of the effects of chronic stress, such as anxiety, depression and insomnia, while strengthening your musculoskeletal, pulmonary, and cardiac systems, leading to stronger resilience against stressful episodes in your body.
You’ll likely not only see the improvement in your WHOOP data when you get the right amount of movement—you’ll also sleep better, feel better, and enjoy life more.
### Eat a colorful diet
When choosing meals, it’s important to eat whole foods (fruits, vegetables, whole grains) that represent all the colors in the rainbow to ensure you’re getting your fair share of macro and micronutrients.
This also means relying less on high-processed foods, notably lacking in nutrients and overloaded with chemicals that are not only hard to pronounce but just plain bad for you. Research has shown that lacking certain critical nutrients, including those that are stress- and mood-regulating and rich in B vitamins, can directly impact your ability to keep your stress levels in check.",4/24/23
types-of-stress,Three Types of Stress—and How to Find Relief,"Track and Manage Stress With Whoop
Stress Monitor offers a clear picture of your personal daily stress levels by measuring your heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) throughout your day and identifying your stress levels on a scale of 0 (low stress) to 3 (your peak stress level).
Because Stress Monitor provides stress scores in real-time, you can learn to identify trends and triggers that impact your stress level and life.
Whether you choose to do a stress-reducing breathing protocol at the moment when your stress is spiking in your body or decide to evaluate other lifestyle or environmental factors that are influencing your stress,
Stress Monitor allows you to measure and understand your own stress and stressors accurately, making it easier for you to manage, and learn to control both.",4/24/23
ultimate-frisbee-training-tool-goose-helton,The 'Ultimate' Training Tool,"“Me and some other guys using WHOOP like to compare our Strains on tournament days,” Helton said. “Unfortunately, somebody else always beats me. I’ve transitioned to more of an offensive player in my later years and it’s the defensive guys who tend to push their aerobic threshold just a little bit further.”
Helton sees WHOOP playing a key role in helping to extend his career as long as possible. “As you age, you start to recover less quickly,” he noted. “The thing WHOOP does really well for me is it brings objectivity to my subjective feelings about my preparedness to train. I’m still pushing pretty hard and I want to keep training really hard, but now I have peace of mind about taking low-intensity days when WHOOP tells me to. I know I’m doing what I need to be doing and I don’t feel like I’m leaving something out on the table.”
The AUDL kicks of it’s seventh season next April. Armed with WHOOP data and a masterful training program, Helton expects to continue playing at an elite level in 2018.",11/14/17
ultimate-frisbee-training-tool-goose-helton,The 'Ultimate' Training Tool,"Jonathan “Goose” Helton first discovered the sport of Ultimate in high school, while playing with his church youth group. “At the time, I didn’t even particularly like it,” he confessed. Who would’ve thought a decade later he’d be named Most Valuable Player of the American Ultimate Disc League (AUDL)?
The AUDL consists of 24 pro teams throughout the United States and Canada, and features some of the most amazing highlights and spectacular feats of athleticism you’ll see in any sport. “There was a time In my life when I was very particular that people call it ‘Ultimate’ and not ‘Ultimate Frisbee,’” Helton said. “‘Frisbee’ is actually a trademark name by the company Wham-O. But I think once you reach a certain level of playing, you don’t really care anymore and become OK with people casually saying ‘Ultimate Frisbee.’”
For the 33-year-old Helton, working as a financial advisor is his “primary way of eating and paying rent.” However, playing Ultimate professionally and being a strength and conditioning coach is what drives him. “Since Ultimate is such a new sport, there have never really been good training programs available that are specific to it,” he explained. Helton aims to provide younger players with a functional performance training platform that gives them tools to succeed that didn’t exist when he first took up the game.
A seasoned veteran who’s played in the AUDL since its inception in 2012, Helton got serious about Ultimate while attending Wheaton College in 2003:
“I was playing a lot of pickup and I heard about a group of people called ‘The Cult.’ They would run drills–I mean, who does that for frisbee? I joined the team and realized for the first time that there were official rules and strategies to the game. That was when I was 19. From there, I gradually grew to love it more and more. When I went to my first tournament, I was hooked. I remember coming home afterwards and thinking ‘That was the most amazing weekend of my life!’”",11/14/17
ultimate-frisbee-training-tool-goose-helton,The 'Ultimate' Training Tool,"“I learned about WHOOP in April from another strength and conditioning coach who also plays Ultimate. He called it a ‘game-changer,’ and he’s not somebody who throws that term around loosely. I asked him a ton of questions and the thing that impressed me the most was the Recovery algorithm. You never really know how the way you feel compares to what your body is actually prepared to do physically. That was something I wanted to get right. If I feel run down and fatigued, is it because I’m a wuss, or because my body needs to take a break?”
“When I began wearing WHOOP, the first thing I realized was how much it helps me moderate my training,” Helton added. “I wish I’d had it a year-and-a-half ago when I was training for Team USA. I was working like a dog, lifting three days a week for a couple hours, doing agility and speed work with conditioning on my ‘off day’–every day I was doing something. There were days I felt crushed and I just pushed through them. WHOOP data could’ve helped me avoid overtraining during the most intense period of my life.”
Here’s a two-week glimpse at Helton’s daily Strain (blue) and Recovery (green/yellow/red) as he prepared for last month’s USA Ultimate National Championships:
Through the first half of October, he did an exceptional job maximizing his training by mirroring his Strain and Recovery–he took on workloads that his body was equipped to handle. As the tournament approached, Helton reduced his Strain each day in order to boost his Recovery and prepare himself for the grueling four-day event. His Recovery peaked at 97% just before the national championships began, indicating his readiness to perform at an optimal level. You can then see the Strain he accumulated from playing three intense games per day, and the corresponding effect it had on his Recoveries.

ultimate-frisbee-training-tool-goose-helton,The 'Ultimate' Training Tool,"Helton recalls a time when he was 16 years old and his father made a character joke about him not being consistent with anything. “I decided from then on I’d be consistent with working out, and I was,” he said. “When I got competitive with Ultimate in college, I used a lot of football and soccer workouts for basic agility and explosiveness. I did anything I saw, all sorts of random exercises I thought might improve my game.”
In 2010, Helton met Tim Morrill, a trainer and fellow Ultimate player. “Tim trained two of my friends, and they each gained six inches to their vertical leap,” Helton said. “I’d never seen anything like it. He’d figured out how to apply his training knowledge to frisbee. I brought him to Chicago where I lived to work with the club team I was playing with. That was a paradigm shift for me. Tim changed the way I did warm-ups, the agility patterns I worked on, and how I spent my time at the gym. That’s what put me in position to win the AUDL MVP in 2012 and 2013.”
Helton’s player profile from the league website states “His training program is designed to help him stay as physically dominant for as long as possible.” He’s been a certified functional strength coach for the past three years, and Morrill is now his business partner. “I started studying under a bunch of different coaches and reading a ton of books,” Helton said. “In particular, I’ve been heavily influenced by Cal Dietz’s Triphasic Training and Mike Boyle’s Functional Training for Sports. A lot of the stuff we do is unilateral to try to restore symmetry within the body because we play a very asymmetrical sport. Running fast was never my problem, slowing down was.”
This past spring, Helton added a new component to his training–WHOOP:",11/14/17

ultra-runner-training-100-mile-race,Training for a 100-Mile Race,"Why he’s now hooked on WHOOP
“In the ultra community, people constantly warn you about overtraining,” Edminster said. “I’ve seen many of my friends go through it–workouts that would normally take them a day to recover from suddenly take a week. It’s really common in our sport because of the massive volume of training you have to do. WHOOP is somewhat of a silver bullet in helping me catch that and see the early warnings signs. Having data to back up my decisions of when to go and when not to go helps me avoid that pitfall.”
“When you’re training that much, one of the things that’s easy to skip is sleep,” Edminster added. “I never paid much attention to that before. Having a visual indicator of it is huge, as is seeing the resulting dips in my HRV after not >sleeping and recovering enough. Prior to having Recovery data, I didn’t really know when I needed rest. Even if I felt like I did, I’d assume I was just being lazy. WHOOP takes the sting out of the ‘you’re just not working hard enough’ thought process that goes into taking a rest day.”
Edminster also finds the Day Strain metric extremely useful:
“WHOOP does a great job of quantifying everything else in my day beyond just my workouts, and how it all compounds. It’s always interesting to see the Strain from my work events and how much they affect my body compared to traditional athletic stuff. For example, major product releases at work have made me alter my training to accommodate for the additional Strain. By understanding everything my body goes through on any given day, and the effect that will have on the following days, I’m able to adjust my workouts to maximize when I am well recovered.”
“I am constantly telling fellow ultra runners how WHOOP has helped me optimize my training,” Edminster concluded. “I haven’t taken my Strap off in six months.",10/19/17
ultra-runner-training-100-mile-race,Training for a 100-Mile Race,"Most of the course consists of trails, with some steep enough that hiking is necessary. Edminster stated that a common strategy is not to run uphill: “The speed that you gain over hiking is not worth the effort, these races are usually won on the downhills and the flats.” There is some occasional road running as well, not to mention a few unexpected obstacles along the way. “At one point in the night I had to navigate through a pretty big field of cows,” Edminster joked. “There were a lot of calves, I was nervous I might upset one of their mothers.”
Luckily, the runners don’t have to carry all of their gear with them for the entire race. They can place drop bags along the way–Edminster noted a change of clothes at the 65-mile mark. As with any race, there are also aid stations set up throughout the course. However, they go well above and beyond what one might expect:
“They are typically spread out every 5-10 miles. They’re really well stocked, most made quesadillas and burritos along with a standard assortment of energy bars and candy. Volunteers that run the aid stations choose what food and other random amenities they provide. Many of them get really into it. I remember seeing a cowboy theme, a nurse and doctor theme, even . One was Swan Lake themed and had a kiddie pool for us to cool off in.”
Edminster called lying in the pool “the turning point” of the race for him. It was around 2 pm, during the hottest time of day. “Not many people took advantage of it,” he said. “I actually tried to convince a few others that I saw sitting and puking to get into the pool to cool down. About 50-60 runners dropped out at that point due to heat exposure.”",10/19/17
ultra-runner-training-100-mile-race,Training for a 100-Mile Race,"Robert Edminster has his dogs to thank for helping him find his passion. “I started adopting dogs and I needed to tire them out somehow,” Edminster told us. “I began jogging with them in the mountains and that quickly turned into me doing trail running.”
Edminster is a site reliability engineer at a company based in Salt Lake City, Utah. He and his wife, Larissa, live in nearby Holladay, just south of the city. A key part of his training is the easy access to over a thousand miles of mountain trails within a short distance of his home. “If I want to get in 16-20 miles a day, I typically wake up and do a slow and easy 6-8 mile run before work with my dogs, then right after work I do another 10-12 miles on the trails,” Edminster said. “This summer, I pretty much gave up everything else outside of work and training. Luckily my wife runs too, it’s kind of a family activity.”
Last month, Edminster competed in the Wasatch Front 100-Mile Endurance Run, widely considered one of the most difficult ultra races in the United States. Its slogan reads “100 miles of heaven and hell,” and the race features “a cumulative elevation gain of approximately 24,000 feet, as well as a cumulative loss of approximately 23,300 feet throughout the course.”
The 32-year-old Edminster finished third overall (with a time of 22 hours and 55 minutes), despite the fact that it was his first-ever 100-miler. Even more impressive may be the fact that he only started running seriously three years ago.",10/19/17
ultra-runner-training-100-mile-race,Training for a 100-Mile Race,"“I leaned heavily on the Sleep Planner to give me a sense of just how much sleep I needed to be properly recovered under those conditions–it was often around 12 hours. I also noticed that after each intense week, within a few days I saw moderate improvements in my HRV [heart rate variability] and RHR [resting heart rate]. This cycle made me think that a short period of overreach once a month or so might be beneficial for making large gains throughout the year.”
“When race day [September 8] drew near, I started to taper,” Edminster explained. “It’s not easy to go from always working so hard to backing off and doing barely anything for a couple weeks. But that’s what you have to do to be ready to run 100 miles. I focussed on getting as much sleep as possible. The night before the race, I was so excited I could hardly sleep. But I wasn’t too stressed about it, because I knew I’d gotten great rest the preceding days.”Edminster slept only 3 hours and 45 minutes the eve of the race (he was in bed for 4:54 and woke up at 2:57 am). However, he averaged 7:33 per night for the month prior, good for an average Sleep Performance of 84%.",10/19/17
ultra-runner-training-100-mile-race,Training for a 100-Mile Race,"Of the nearly 23 hours Edminster spent on the course, he said only about four of them were uncomfortable. For the other 19, he “loved every second of it,” enjoying the mountains and the sights. “I went out much too fast early on to stay with the leaders. After an hour-and-a-half I backed way off to recover. After that I made a more measured attempt at moving my way up towards the front.”
Below is Edminster’s heart rate data for the entire day. You can see it spiked as the race began, then dropped dramatically for a period of time just after 6:30 am when he realized he needed to rest. From there, it stayed consistently elevated for the next 21 hours:“I didn’t go into the Wasatch 100 thinking I would do any better than finish,” Edminster admitted. “But through well-informed training and smart racing, I surprised myself and pretty much everyone in the local running community.”",10/19/17
ultra-runner-training-100-mile-race,Training for a 100-Mile Race,"What is it like to actually run 100 miles?
The Wasatch Ultra Marathon began Friday, September 8, at 5 am. To finish, runners were required to complete the course within 36 hours, by Saturday at 5 pm. Edminster’s average pace was 13:45 per mile for the 100 miles. He crossed the finish line in third place at 3:55 am Saturday morning, 22 hours and 55 minutes after he started.
“Ultra’s are crazy, but you don’t go all out the whole time like you would in a normal race,” Edminster said. “The only way to do it is to slow your heart rate down. Mentally they can be really hard to keep going, especially through the night. Some people do take naps, that’s not unheard of. But if you’re near the front you’re not napping, the energy and adrenaline keeps you going.”
There are also many other significant challenges to overcome beyond just the sheer length of the race. These include unfriendly rocky terrain, thin air at high altitudes and brutal temperature changes ranging from 90 degrees in the valley during the day, to the upper 30’s in the mountains at night.
“A lot of thought and preparation has to go into what you wear and bring,” Edminster said. “I filled my living room floor the day before the race with all the gear I might need–a headlamp for night time, fresh clothes, tights and waterproof clothing for unexpected showers, etc. You also have to take into account things like ‘at what time of day do I need to stop dumping water on myself so I can dry off and stay warm later?’”",10/19/17
ultra-runner-training-100-mile-race,Training for a 100-Mile Race,"Training for the Wasatch 100
Around the time Edminster decided to take up ultrarunning, he read a book called 80/20 Running by Matt Fitzgerald. “His ideas resonated with me, so I started trying to train off of an 80/20 program–80% easy and 20% hard for a given week, Edminster said. “It quickly became apparent to me that to maximize the plan I really needed to be monitoring sleep so I’d be able to give it my all on hard work days. That’s what originally led to me getting a WHOOP Strap, but as it turned out, I based my entire year’s training off of it.”
Last February, Edminster learned that he’d qualified for the Wasatch 100 in September. “I started to panic that I was actually going to have run 100 miles and there was no way I would be ready in time,” he said. “So I went all in and upped my mileage to a base of 60 per week [from about 30 per week previously] and 12,000-20,000 feet of climbing. The initial ramp up was pretty rough, but by watching my daily Strain and picking which days to go hard and which days I needed to rest, I was quickly able to get to the point that it felt normal. From there, I did much more intense training weeks where I pushed my milage to 100 per week. The only way that was possible was by listening to my WHOOP. It helped me build up to longer sleeps and maximize my Recovery for days with difficult workouts scheduled.”
As the race approached, Edminster planned a pair of extremely strenuous weeks (100+ miles while climbing over 20,000 feet) where he intentionally ignored his Strain and Recovery. Look below at the four-day periods from August 6-9 and 21-24:During those times, Edmister said his Sleep data took center stage:",10/19/17

In 2015, Edminster joined a local running club called the Wasatch Mountain Wranglers. Soon after, he was convinced that he should try competing in an ultra. “I ran my first 50k last fall,” Edminster said. “Due to the field being pretty small, I somehow managed to win it. At that point, I started to think about serious training and how I could extract the best performance from myself. This led to me playing around with a wide variety of training products. I’m a bit of a data nerd, that’s half the fun for me.”
Edminster uses each of the following pieces of wearable tech:
A sensor on the laces of his shoe to quantify power output, which he finds useful when running up hill.
A sleeve on his calf muscle to measure his lactate acid threshold so he can “recalibrate zones every month or so.” It also allows him to gauge muscle oxygen levels when doing interval training in order to optimize his recovery time between intervals.
A chest strap heart rate monitor, which he says gives the most accurate readings during intense exercise.
A clip on the back of his shorts for monitoring running form to try and improve efficiency. Edminster only wears this when he runs on roads and mentioned that he “has doubts about this product at the moment.”
An app for tracking his runs which “lacks any real training tools and is more of a social media platform for running.”
A multi-sport GPS watch that “sort of just ties everything together.” Edminster said that it has recovery and training metrics, but he “finds them to be so far off that they are worthless.”
Along with everything listed above, Edminster also wears a WHOOP Strap 2.0:

It is well documented that our three most important psychological needs are:

1) Purpose – alignment between behaviors and core values 2) Control over one’s life 3) Efficacy – feeling like you have the skills and resources to do what is asked of you (Ryan and Deci, 2012).
The first core principle is to realize that these are needs to pay attention to daily. The second is to understand that when any of these three needs are challenged or threatened, your ANS will perceive this threat and send signals to your heart to increase blood pressure, heart and breathing rate, and body temperature so you can take action to deal with the threat.",3/20/20

understanding-anxiety-autonomic-nervous-system,How to Rethink Anxiety: It Can Be a Sign Your Body is Ready to Perform!,"What Triggers Anxiety?
Things are crazy right now for sure, but for me there are no real immediate threats. Framing the moment is powerful. Controlled breathing is a great strategy, but you can also think about the release of adrenaline and cortisol as an “in the moment gift” of ENERGY. Our default is often to label these physiological signals as “bad” or try to mute them with calming interventions, but really these signals might be your body urging you to take action!
Our bodies send us signals every day. How we deal with them to a large degree dictates our mental and emotional well-being. When it comes to anxiety, identifying, interpreting and thoughtfully channeling the signals your body is sending you can help you feel in control and help you deal with feelings of stress in a productive way.
Here are some things we know about how the human nervous system works, as well as ideas on how to interpret and leverage the signals your body is sending to you.",3/20/20
understanding-anxiety-autonomic-nervous-system,How to Rethink Anxiety: It Can Be a Sign Your Body is Ready to Perform!,"“Stress” = Energy
Instead, we should consider evaluating why we are receiving these signals from our ANS. The potential issue I observe is due to readily available “sympathetic” fixes, the easier and “less stressful” path [in the moment] is to avoid or dull these sympathetic signals. As a result, we might miss the opportunity to use the energy/stress produced by sympathetic activation to take care of whatever is causing the anxiety.
By increasing our awareness and connection to these signals, we become more connected to the “why” associated with this surge of energy and less susceptible to being distracted or overcome by short-term “fixes.” And even more importantly, this gives ourselves an opportunity to channel the stress in productive, helpful ways!",3/20/20
understanding-anxiety-autonomic-nervous-system,How to Rethink Anxiety: It Can Be a Sign Your Body is Ready to Perform!,"## Understanding HRV & Anxiety
These are anxious times we’re living in right now. At WHOOP, we talk a lot about how physical exertion impacts our heart rate variability (HRV) and recovery but it is important to note that emotional and psychological stress can also play a significant role in mediating HRV (Chalmers et al., 2014). One thing we can all do to make the most of anxiety and stress is to try to identify the source of the anxiety and turn it into positive energy.
The problem is “the battle” isn’t always obvious. Anxiety can be subtle, appear out of nowhere and accumulate in ways that are difficult to perceive. The more connected we are to the nuanced perturbations of our body the better positioned we will be to interpret and leverage these moments to our advantage.
Last Sunday, I started thinking about the week ahead and the uncertainty around my routines and my family’s routines–all of which I could no longer control. Not to mention, the state of the world in general. I could feel my heart rate increase and anxiety creep in. The sympathetic branch of my nervous system was activated sending signals to my body to get ready for battle. But what is the “battle” exactly?",3/20/20
understanding-anxiety-autonomic-nervous-system,How to Rethink Anxiety: It Can Be a Sign Your Body is Ready to Perform!,"Understanding the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)
The heart has its own nervous system through which the brain and heart communicate and influence each other in a synchronized fashion.
Heart rate variability (HRV) refers to the beat-to-beat alterations in heart rate or pulse. HRV is now understood to be reflective of inner emotional states and an indirect estimator of health and well-being (McCraty et. al., 2014).
The two branches of the autonomic nervous system (parasympathetic and sympathetic) compete to send signals to the heart. In a healthy system, when it’s time to take action or there is a perceived threat, the sympathetic will dominate, when there are no threats, parasympathetic dominates.
When speaking of autonomic balance, it should be kept in mind that a healthy system is constantly and dynamically changing. Therefore, an important indicator of the health status of the regulatory systems is the capacity to respond to and adjust the relative autonomic balance (example: Heart rate) to the appropriate state for the context the person is engaged in at any given moment.
Knowing your heart rate variability can lead to improved health and well-being (Bornemann, 2019).",3/20/20
understanding-anxiety-autonomic-nervous-system,How to Rethink Anxiety: It Can Be a Sign Your Body is Ready to Perform!,"Autonomic Nervous System and Anxiety
It is important to understand that while HRV is an excellent indicator of physical readiness, it is also a powerful estimator of mental well-being (Shaffer et al., 2014). So, while physical activity plays a meaningful role in HRV modulation (the more physically fit you are, the higher the HRV), psychological stress likely plays a more powerful role in mediating HRV. In 2014, a meta analysis demonstrated that anxiety disorders are associated with significant reductions in HRV (Chalmers et al., 2014).
When core psychological needs are unattended to, the “dissonance” and associated biological stress responses (high cortisol leading to sympathetic activation) will manifest in your ANS and will then be reflected in the variation of time between your heart-beats (less variation = depressed HRV, more variation = higher HRV). Higher HRV means you are more responsive to both signals from your ANS, which will enable higher levels of functioning relative to your potential.
Unfortunately, we often interpret or label these sympathetic signals as a negative thing (stress and anxiety), and as a result, our default might be to mute the signal with a short-term unhelpful “sympathetic fix” (recreational drugs, medication, procrastination, food, alcohol, ruminating about the future, etc).
Learn More: Impact of Stress on HRV, Resting Heart Rate & Recovery",3/20/20
understanding-anxiety-autonomic-nervous-system,How to Rethink Anxiety: It Can Be a Sign Your Body is Ready to Perform!,"Awareness Enables Appropriate Action
Sympathetic activation serves the purpose of helping us realize the value in work, progress, innovation, creativity – simply getting stuff done – so our lives can be organized and continue to move forwards. Parasympathetic activation is enabled by being present and enjoying the beauty of the moment. Elevated awareness (along with a good night’s sleep) positions us to appropriately interpret and capitalize on these states, thereby reducing misplaced anxiety and stress.
So next time you get a surge of stress and feel anxious, consider the source. Be mindful that these energy producing biological responses might be the unconscious part of your body urging you to take action. When I could feel the anxiety build last weekend, I used that as motivation to clean my basement and garage, and set up my patio! Whenever I channel anxious energy into something that feels productive, I never regret it afterwards.",3/20/20

In a new study led by WHOOP Senior Vice President of Data Science & Research, Emily Capodilupo, WHOOP identified a novel biomarker that may be helpful in identifying full term and preterm births. WHOOP has observed that maternal heart rate variability (HRV) steadily declines throughout the course of pregnancy, and at seven weeks before birth, HRV inverts and begins to rise. That inversion is consistent with the eventual delivery date for both premature and full-term pregnancies, acting as a potential indicator of the likely delivery date. Understanding this change in HRV, which WHOOP researchers have labeled the WHOOP Inflection Point, has the potential to save lives, reduce medical costs, and provide more insight to expecting parents.
This research was initially conducted as part of our pregnancy and exercise HRV research with OBGYN Dr. Rowan of West Virginia University. That study was published in the scientific journal BioMed Central but only included research on 18 full-term births. WHOOP expanded the research at a speed and scale not seen in academic research and conducted the March 2022 Reproductive Health Study — the largest study of its kind ever conducted — to evaluate 1200 pregnancies and eventually identify this novel digital biomarker.",11/2/22

This potentially life-changing discovery led us to develop Pregnancy Insightsing. Pregnancy is a uniquely challenging journey, and every week is a major milestone. After turning on the Pregnancy Insightsing toggle, expectant members can input their projected due date from week 5 onwards to begin receiving a weekly report that contains tailored insights and recommendations as part of their Weekly Performance Assessment. From needing more rest, to increasing hydration, to exercise considerations, Pregnancy Insightsing sheds more light on the adapting needs of the body. The Weekly Performance Assessment will also include resting heart rate (RHR) and heart rate variability (HRV) trends during every trimester based on their personalized baseline. Given these metrics change significantly throughout the duration of pregnancy, WHOOP will provide trend lines for expectant members to better understand how their own changes compare to what has been seen throughout the course of pregnancy for similar members.

Can you think back to a time when you found yourself gasping for air while crying? If you can, you may remember doing two quick inhales followed by a long exhale. This is a natural spontaneous behavior called “cyclic sighing” or the “physiological sigh”. Cyclic sighing brings people into a relaxed state – our bodies naturally know how to do it. It’s also a recognized breathwork technique that’s intentionally used to increase relaxation and change the state of the autonomic nervous system.
The autonomic nervous system automatically regulates important bodily functions like heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, and digestion – without us ever needing to think about them. This system includes two divisions, the sympathetic division that gets activated when you feel stressed or in danger, and the parasympathetic division that helps your body relax.
When you breathe in, your heart rate increases, activating the sympathetic division, and when you breathe out, your heart rate decreases, activating the parasympathetic division. Cyclic sighing involves a longer exhale, which helps stimulate the parasympathetic division, in turn helping you calm down. There are several breathwork techniques that can stimulate these two divisions and cause physiological changes.",3/29/23

We travel more than 100,000 miles by air each year, training and competing in both the northern and southern hemispheres and on 4 different continents. It is a busy and hectic schedule that leads to significant changes in time zones.
Unfortunately, we rarely have the luxury of rest days after travel and usually have to get right to work. Quite simply, it is brutal on both the body and mind. I personally do not sleep well on planes and it doesn’t bode well for our team either. When you combine the lack of sleep volume and quality with a dramatic shift in time zones, the result is often super fatigued staff and athletes.
Mike’s WHOOP stats Following an overnight flight across several time zones.
We are constantly working on strategies to reduce this travel fatigue, but clearly will never eliminate it. How does my WHOOP data help with this? It provides very clear, immediate, and real information on how these strategies are working and how we should proceed with our plans moving forward. This allows me to make adjustments and have a realistic sense for what I am capable of and how I will feel on these days.
I regularly monitor my sleep, recovery, and heart rate variability stats. For example, look at what happened to me last August when I traveled across 6 time zones to Switzerland. My HRV dropped from 36 to 21, my resting heart rate jumped from 53 to 64, and my WHOOP recovery (which had been consistently green and yellow) fell all the way to 1%.

For the sport of alpine ski racing we are generally training and racing at higher altitudes. This is where you need to go to find snow, especially with climate change and global warming. I live in Stowe, Vermont at an elevation of just 889 feet above sea level. This makes the transition to serious altitude extremely difficult.
These challenges for me parallel the same ones I face with changes in time zones, and I regularly look at and use the same data. For example, I’m often traveling from the Eastern Standard to Mountain Time Zone. It’s only a 2-hour time change, but it increases my living altitude by 7,250 feet and my sleep quality goes in the tank.
After flying to Vail last November, I observed the following changes in my data:
HRV: All week it had been in the mid 30s, dropped to 13
HRV: All week it had been in the mid 30s, dropped to 13
RHR: Went from consistently in the 55-57 range up to 75
RHR: Went from consistently in the 55-57 range up to 75
Recovery: The next day it was just 12%
Recovery: The next day it was just 12%
Multiple nights at high altitude also caused my respiratory rate to climb from 13.4 to 15.1 breaths per minute. Following these changes, I’ve found it can take me 5-7 days to get my sleep and recovery numbers back to normal.
I am not an expert in these subjects, but I wanted to share my experiences with you.

Doctors found a tear in the wall of his coronary artery, the cause of which still remains a mystery. Nick has made it his goal to prove that he, and other young heart attack survivors like him, can still live a physically active and competitive lifestyle. Nick recently reached out to WHOOP with a desire to share what our product has done for him. Here is his story.
There is nothing quite like the feeling of freedom you get from flying downhill on a bike, or pushing your body to its limit in a sprint to the finish. Cycling allows me to clear my mind and feed my competitive spirit, but the training can be extremely demanding.
Not long ago, a close friend and training partner, Eric Torello, introduced me to WHOOP. Since then, I have been able to eliminate the guesswork in assessing what my body can handle.
WHOOP is a small lightweight band that tracks your biometrics and connects to a mobile app. Unlike similar products, it takes into consideration the amount of sleep you got the night before and incorporates how well your body is able to recover through 24/7 performance monitoring. With WHOOP, I have not only become a better athlete, but also a more effective tenant of my body’s well being.
I enjoy being competitive in group rides, which due to my hectic schedule, is what I consider my “races.” I am always looking at how I can keep improving for the next weekend’s competition. When it comes to getting a positive result, preparation is essential. The morning Recovery metric that WHOOP provides has become invaluable to my preparation and strategy for these rides.",7/12/17

On the other hand, if my WHOOP Strap tells me I am well Recovered, I will put in harder efforts throughout the ride because I know that my body can take on that Strain.
Strain has always been a major topic of conversation in training for a sport like cycling. What is normally a beneficial amount of training load over a period of time can quickly become detrimental when you are not able to see the warning signs of your body’s fatigue or overtraining. WHOOP gives me early indicators when I am taking on too much Strain and need to back off.
In the screenshot of my WHOOP data below, you can see that at one point I was putting in a lot of hours training and became not only physically fatigued, but mentally exhausted as well. My WHOOP data confirmed what I was feeling and convinced me to take a short break from the bike to rest and recuperate. WHOOP saved me from completely overtraining, which could have taken weeks or months to come back from.
By sharing my WHOOP data with my coach Tony Baca, a pro cyclist for Elbowz Pro Racing, we are able to make necessary changes to my training plan in order to get the most of every workout. We schedule my training days in advance, but sometimes work calls at 10 pm on a Friday night.

She also regularly walks up to 12 miles per day simply by doing her job.
Angela is a postal carrier in Fairport Harbor, Ohio. “The majority of my activity actually comes from work,” she says. “I have about three hours of total driving over the course of a week, but my routes are mostly residential walking. I cover an off day for each of my regulars, so I have five separate routes. They run from 7-12 miles each, plus whatever I get for overtime. Normally, I plan my workouts based on which route I have that day. There’s one tough route where I won’t do anything afterwards–it’s absolutely not going to happen. It’s the longest route with many, many stairs. It’s something that just makes you exhausted by the end of the day.”
Even with the knowledge of how far she’d have to walk each day, it was still difficult for Angela to find a happy medium between work and working out. The fitness wearable she used previously tracked her steps and monitored her heart rate, but it didn’t tell her the cumulative effect her work day had on her body.
“I used to do the same CrossFit routine every morning,” she says. “It was terrible because I didn’t know my body well enough, I didn’t know how much Strain I had each day. I started using WHOOP so that I could plan my activities around my actual Strain, not just on what I was thinking I was going to feel. I always know how much distance I’ll have to cover, but what if it starts raining, or I have extra packages, or I get overtime? The WHOOP Day Strain accounts for all of that.

Knowing when to go to bed so that I can wake up at a certain time to exercise and still be able to perform well at work is extremely valuable to me. It’s awesome to have that information at available my fingertips.”
With her alarm clock set for at 6:30 am and her Sleep Performance set to Peak, Angela usually checks the Sleep Planner before dinner, then does her best to get in bed by the recommended time. She also checks her Day Strain and will often push back her wake-up time by half an hour if her Strain is higher than expected, or do yoga instead of CrossFit or jogging.
Here’s a look at a recent month of her Sleep Performance data:
Angela achieved 100% of her Sleep needed to Peak in 18 out of 30 days, and never once dipped below 70%. She also hit 100% every Monday, starting her work weeks off on the right foot.
Below is her Strain data for the same month. The blue bars indicate Strain from workouts she logged (the very short blue ones are from yoga):
Saturday, May 13, was Angela’s highest Day Strain (19.5) since getting on the WHOOP system. She competed in a half marathon in the morning, and then also did a two-mile “fun run” that night. Why? “My boyfriend signed me up for that,’ she says. “He thought it was a different Saturday.” She then took it easy the next day (Sunday, May 14, an 8.2 total Day Strain) in order to prepare for the week ahead.
“There are definitely routes that I’m more stressed out on than others,” Angela adds. “Some have more parcels than others. And since my routes rotate, if you look at my Strains you can often see diagonal lines (emphasized in red above) throughout the calendar.”",7/1/17
vagus-nerve-increase-hrv,Ways to Activate the Vagus Nerve and Boost HRV & Immunity,"EXERCISE THE RIGHT AMOUNT
When talking about immune health and functional adaptive response to exercise, the goal should be to optimize the interplay between the cardiovascular system and nervous system. “Under-training” (too little load relative to capacity) and “overtraining” (too much load relative to capacity) can not only make us more injury prone, but also compromise our defense system. WHOOP strain and recovery data can be extremely powerful in helping guide your workouts and give you insight into how you are coping and adapting to not just training demands, but also “life load” demands (i.e., everything else that is not exercise).
Journal of Sport and Health Science suggests that being physically active makes you less vulnerable to getting sick. According to David Nieman, director of the Appalachian State University Human Performance Lab, “Our data show that physically active people have a 40-50% reduction in the number of days they’re ill with acute respiratory infections.” In short, exercise is good for us, mentally, physically, and emotionally!
There is a sweet spot however, a balance that needs to be considered between both training volume and intensity and life load volume and intensity (stress, regular daily activities, etc.) with how much time you can devote to recovery and sleep. WHOOP quantifies this and gives you valuable insight into how your body is adapting to exercise stimulus and life load.",4/30/20

Getting in at least 20 minutes of natural sunlight within half-an-hour of waking up in the morning (even if it is cloudy), as well as watching the sky transition from day to night in the evening, reinforces your natural circadian clock and has been shown to promote healthy cortisol and sleep patterns. In principle, we want to incorporate behaviors that help facilitate our body’s natural cycles. There is significant science that supports the important connection between an “aligned circadian clock” and both psychological and physiological well-being (including immune health).
Morning light exposure and watching the sky change at night are simple habits that will optimally prompt biological processes associated with regulating sleep/wake times, appetite, energy levels, hormone production, and body temperature. Other benefits include improved mood and alertness, better heuristic processing, as well as increased vitamin D production (key for healthy immunity) and physical strength.",4/30/20
vagus-nerve-increase-hrv,Ways to Activate the Vagus Nerve and Boost HRV & Immunity,"HYDRATING, EATING (AND FASTING) FOR GUT HEALTH
Gut health is directly correlated to immune health. One of the simplest things you can do to promote it is to drink water. Drinking lots of cool water (8, 9, 10 glasses a day), will activate the vagus nerve in your gut.
Probiotics are the “modulators of the microbiota”–they can improve the feedback loop of the vagus nerve and the gut/brain axis. Probiotic bacteria strains such as L Rhamnosus have been shown in studies to have antidepressant-like effects and influence GABA receptors (which are calming to the parasympathetic nervous system and are mediated by the vagus nerve).
A study on Parmigiano Reggiano cheese showed that it can have up to 10 million CFU of viable lactic acid bacteria per gram when you eat it, a seemingly delicious way to get beneficial bacteria! Bifidobacterium longum (found in yogurt) is another important bacteria that reduces anxiety by acting through the vagus nerve via the gut. Check out this great resource on friendly bacteria that can improve gut health.
Fasting is also a known contributor to a healthy gut. It’s been shown to strengthen the immune system by giving your body the chance to rest and recover (since it’s not busy digesting food or defending against inflammatory agents in food). This state of rest can be especially helpful for taming autoimmunity (i.e., misdirected immune responses that occur when the immune system goes awry and attacks the body itself) and improves neurological responses.
You might notice in your WHOOP data that when you stop eating 3-4 hours prior to bed and your sleep need is met (essentially creating a 12-hour “fast”), you will see a higher HRV (assuming your training and recovery are in proportion). Digestion is a parasympathetic activity, so it competes with recovery resource allocation. Therefore, periods of not eating can be beneficial as all resources can go toward recovery and rejuvenation.",4/30/20
vagus-nerve-increase-hrv,Ways to Activate the Vagus Nerve and Boost HRV & Immunity,"The vagus nerve activates the parasympathetic nervous system and basically functions as the button you can press to reduce stress. It originates on the surface of the brain but wanders throughout the body transmitting information to tissues and organs. The nerve plays a critical role in letting your body know that things are going to be okay. Heart rate variability (HRV) is also controlled by the vagus nerve. The more “complex” or variable your HRV, the more resilient and adaptable you are.
## Increasing Vagal Tone
The vagus nerve is analogous to a muscle; you can train it to get stronger. Increasing vagal tone (vagus nerve activity) and heart rate variability is one of the most practical ways to improve your overall wellness quickly. We can activate the vagus nerve, and hence influence parasympathetic tone (the deactivating branch of the autonomic nervous system), with breathing exercises, massage, intermittent fasting, taking omega-3 supplements, cold/heat thermogenesis, and exercise, among other things. Behaviors like laughing, sex, chanting, gargling, and singing also activate the vagus nerve and in turn the parasympathetic nervous system.",4/30/20

### DIAPHRAGMATIC BREATHING
Voluntary regulation of internal bodily states (e.g., actively reducing your heart rate throughout the day with conscious breathwork) increases emotional control and psychological well-being. The working principle when thinking about calming the system is to limit the number of sensory inputs (i.e., sound, light, and potentially certain scents) and use conscious breath or body scanning (paying attention to parts of the body and bodily sensations in a gradual sequence from feet to head) as a mechanism to focus attention away from the mind.
As little as 1 minute of diaphragmatic breathing a few times per day has been shown to have a beneficial effect on the cardiopulmonary system and enhance parasympathetic activation. One of my favorite ways to activate vagal tone through breathwork is the following:
breath in to the count of 5
hold to the count of 5
breath out to the count of 5
wait to the count of 5 before breathing back in
This type of rhythmic breathing stimulates your parasympathetic nervous system and lowers stress levels while also increasing your vagal tone. There are a lot of great resources to tap to better understand various techniques. But overall, don’t worry so much about how you are doing it, just do it.
The simple act of being still and consciously minding your breath and/or parts of your body can help you stay in the present moment, which is where “peace” lives. These small, mini moments of “peace” help to mitigate “negative stress accumulation,” reduce anxiety, and as a result, can improve sleep onset latency and capacity to manage stress/control emotional response, promote autonomic balance, boost immunity and just generally make you more enjoyable to be around.",4/30/20
vagus-nerve-increase-hrv,Ways to Activate the Vagus Nerve and Boost HRV & Immunity,"COLD THERMOGENESIS
Cold thermogenesis (CT) is the practice of exposing yourself to cold temperatures. Research has shown that it has a positive influence on health and longevity by changing gene expression and fat cells. Cold adaptation offers a huge advantage in many different aspects of medicine, not only for obesity and diabetes, but for performance and longevity as well.
Acute cold exposure will activate the vagus nerve. Your sympathetic system (fight or flight) decreases when your body adjusts to cold, while your parasympathetic system (rest and digest) increases. There’s actually a physiologic change that occurs that increases testosterone, growth hormone, and metabolic efficiency. CT ignites your body’s natural healing powers by providing long-lasting changes to the immune, lymphatic, circulatory, and digestive systems and generally enhances overall quality of life–all while leaving you feeling relaxed and refreshed.
Do not start by jumping into a cold tub right away. You will torture yourself and leave behind a very unpleasant memory. It is important to “cold adapt” first. I began by simply dunking my face into ice cold water. Later I upped my exposure by taking cold showers for 30 seconds, then slowly increased the time. I also live in a cold climate, so for a good 6 months of the year I can take advantage of a nearby lake to help stimulate cold thermogenesis. Here are some useful CT protocols to start your path to cold adaptation (timing, duration, temperature, food, and other considerations).",4/30/20
valentines-day-heart-rate-variability,Is Valentine's Day Good for Your Heart (Rate Variability)?,"Increases in Next-Day HRV and Recovery
While we didn’t uncover anything notable in HR data on Valentine’s Day, we did find some intriguing numbers relating to the day after. On average, WHOOP member recovery on Saturday, February 15 was 58%, a full 4% higher than normal (the baseline from surrounding Saturdays was 54%).
One of the key factors used in determining daily WHOOP recovery (a metric for how prepared your body is to perform) is heart rate variability, or HRV for short. The average HRV for our members on February 15 of last year was 65 milliseconds, a 6.6% increase from normal (61 ms).
## Valentine’s Day Behaviors Improve Heart Rate Variability?
Are there things we do or behaviors we generally abide by on Valentine’s Day that are beneficial to our heart rate variability?
WHOOP VP of Performance Science Kristen Holmes wrote a piece last year entitled “Self-Rule” Choices You Can Make to Increase HRV. In it she states:
“Accessing feelings of gratitude, doing random acts of kindness, and reliving positive experiences directly activates brain regions associated with the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine is our energy neurotransmitter and we need appropriate levels to feel energetic and excited about life. It is also an important communication mediator at the neural-immune level.”
Expressing gratitude, acts of kindness and recalling positive experiences are all certainly activities commonly associated with Valentine’s Day. As is “engaging in relationships that bring you value,” another of the choices Kristen discusses. “People who nurture and support your core values and enable autonomy will help relieve harmful levels of stress,” she says, and stress is a known inhibitor of heart rate variability.

However, there are several locations on the body where you can accurately measure your pulse rate.
## How WHOOP 4.0 Measures Pulse Data
In designing new sensors for WHOOP 4.0, we tested 20 locations on the body and found four sites besides the wrist that are near strong pulse points where heart rate can be accurately measured. These locations were selected for their accuracy and for comfort regardless of whether you’re running, lifting weights or sleeping.
“We analyzed data to find the locations with the highest signal and lowest noise and we picked the ones that showed the potential to produce the best accuracy in terms of extracted physiological features,” said Behnoosh Tavakoli, the Director of Signal Processing at WHOOP. Tavakoli defines noise as anything that can disrupt the signal such as motion or respiration.
The new sensor system with five LEDs in the WHOOP 4.0 monitor changes in blood volume in the microvascular bed in the skin and WHOOP engineers selected the points where the signal was always high regardless of whether the wearer is moving or resting.

what-causes-an-increased-respiratory-rate,What Causes an Increased Respiratory Rate?,"What Causes a Low Respiratory Rate?
An abnormally low breathing rate, or bradypnea, is generally a rate below 12 breaths per minute in adults. You can slow your own breathing by controlling your inhales and exhales, a common relaxation practice, but that is not considered abnormal.
A number of things can cause decreased respiratory rate, including:
Opioids and other drugs.
Sleeping aids.
Lung disease and cancer.
Hypothyroidism.
Brain injuries.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
## WHOOP Monitors Your Normal Respiratory Rate
WHOOP monitors your respiratory rate on a nightly basis. You can view your average RPM in the WHOOP app.
WHOOP measures respiratory rate during sleep using a phenomenon called Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia. Basically, your heart rate increases when you inhale and decreases when you exhale. WHOOP tracks respiratory rate during sleep when your body is in a restful state for the most reliable consistent readings. Respiratory rate is a component of the WHOOP recovery metric, along with sleep, resting heart rate, and heart rate variability.
You can view your nightly respiratory rate in the WHOOP app. The WHOOP Health Monitor helps you track your nightly metrics and lets you know if your respiratory rate strays outside your personal norm.

what-causes-an-increased-respiratory-rate,What Causes an Increased Respiratory Rate?,"What Causes Increased Respiratory Rate?
Abnormal breathing is caused by the body’s need to adjust to low oxygen or high carbon dioxide levels. Diseases, injuries, and certain drugs can lead to changes in breathing, which can indicate problems.
Diseases and conditions that can increase respiratory rate include:
Pneumonia, which is an infection that causes inflammation in your lungs’ air sacs or alveoli leading to symptoms including cough, fever, chills, and trouble breathing.
Influenza, a virus that causes fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, and runny nose.
Asthma and other lung conditions and diseases.
Heart problems including congestive heart failure.
Anxiety and stress, which can increase heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate.
Fever, the body’s response to an abnormal process happening inside it, such as an infection.
Dehydration.
Allergic reactions.
Non-medical reasons that may raise breathing rate include:
Drinking alcohol in the evening.
Caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea or soda.
Certain medications such as amphetamines.
Smoking marijuana.
High altitude.
Poor air quality.
## Respiratory Rate and COVID-19
WHOOP members have often observed high respiratory rates alongside testing positive for COVID-19. Pro golfer Nick Watney saw an increase from 14 to 18 RPM the morning he tested positive for COVID.
“I checked the [WHOOP] data and my respiratory rate had gone up. I’m usually in the low 14s [and it had gone up] to the low 18s,” Nick told us on the WHOOP Podcast.
Since 2020, WHOOP members have been able to log their diagnoses of COVID-19 in the Journal feature. WHOOP published a study in the journal PLOS ONE “Analyzing Changes In Respiratory Rate to Predict the Risk of Covid-19 Infection.”

what-causes-an-increased-respiratory-rate,What Causes an Increased Respiratory Rate?,"Respiration is controlled by receptors in the lungs that convey sensory input to the brain. Illness or injury of the lungs can cause the respiratory center of the brain to change its firing patterns and alter breathing rhythm and volume.
When oxygen levels don’t meet the body’s demand, aerobic metabolism stops and energy production declines. If carbon dioxide accumulates in the bloodstream, the blood becomes more acidic and cells are damaged, leading to organ failure.
Respiratory rate in adults is generally consistent from day to day and has been considered a neglected vital sign, but when it does change it is usually meaningful.
## What is Considered an Elevated Respiratory Rate?
The average adult takes between 12 and 20 breaths or respirations per minute (RPM) while at rest. In adults, an elevated respiratory rate is generally considered to be more than 20 RPM. Children have significantly higher respiration rates that change as they grow.
Rapid shallow breathing is referred to as tachypnea, which means you take more breaths than usual in one minute. Symptoms of tachypnea include the sensation of shortness of breath and inability to get enough air.
Working out can cause a high respiratory rate as your body uses more oxygen and increases carbon dioxide production. You may breathe 3-4 times more frequently during exercise. This rapid deep breathing is called hyperpnea and it’s the appropriate response to increasing carbon dioxide production in the body.
Normal respiratory rate does not change significantly in adults, which means that even small changes may signify potential problems such as illness or injury.",1/19/22
what-does-an-infection-do-to-your-respiratory-rate,What Does an Infection Do to Your Respiratory Rate?,"Resting Heart Rate Convinces Member to Get Retested
You may notice your heart beating faster when you’re not feeling well. Respiratory infections can increase resting heart rate (RHR) as your heart has to work harder to get oxygen to your organs.
In Example B, a WHOOP member was told December 22 that she was exposed to COVID-19. On the 23rd she tested negative for COVID, but her resting heart rate increased to over 72 bpm, well above her typical range of 49-54 bpm. She continued having a higher than average RHR for four days. She said her abnormal data convinced her to get tested again, and she tested positive on the 27th.
Example B shows how a WHOOP member’s resting heart rate spiked after being exposed to Covid-19. Her RHR stayed above norm for four days before it returned to baseline.
## HRV Shows Member’s Body Fighting Illness
Heart rate variability (HRV) is a measure of your autonomic nervous system and one of the best objective metrics for physical fitness, and for determining your body’s readiness to perform. A high HRV means your body is physically ready to perform, but a low HRV may indicate a problem such as fatigue, dehydration, or illness.
In Example C, a WHOOP member began feeling sick January 5, and his HRV dropped the next day to 43. He tested negative for COVID-19 that week. By January 9 his HRV was back to his typical range of 94-131.
Example C: A WHOOP member experienced very low HRV the day after he began feeling ill. He tested negative for COVID-19 and his HRV was back to normal shortly afterwards.",2/15/22
what-does-an-infection-do-to-your-respiratory-rate,What Does an Infection Do to Your Respiratory Rate?,"Respiratory Rate May Increase Before Illness
Respiratory rate, or how many respirations (breaths) you take per minute, typically ranges from 12 to 20 rpm. During an infection inflammation and mucus can make it harder to take breaths, leading to increased respiratory rate. Rapid shallow breathing or tachypnea means you take more breaths than usual each minute.
Illnesses including pneumonia, flu, and COVID-19 can cause increased respiratory rates. Examples of recent WHOOP data shows how respiratory rate can change during a respiratory illness.
Respiratory rate does not generally vary much from day to day, so a change of two rpm can mean something significant is happening.
In Example A, a WHOOP member rang in the New Year with a fever, body aches, upset stomach, and fatigue, but says she didn’t get tested for COVID-19 after thinking her symptoms were another infection. She said her respiratory symptoms were only noticeable in her WHOOP data, which increased from her typical range of 16-17.5 up to 20 rpm while she was ill.
WHOOP reports respiratory rate during sleep by calculating it from heart rate data through a phenomenon known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Simply put, when we breathe in, our heart rate increases and when we breathe out our heart rate decreases, allowing us to preferentially pass blood by the lungs while they are full of oxygen.
Because our autonomic nervous systems increase heart rate during inhalation and decrease heart rate during exhalation, we can see the respiratory rate in continuous heart rate data by looking for this cyclical increase/decrease pattern.
Example A: WHOOP member noticed her respiration rate increased in December but tested negative for COVID-19.",2/15/22

The half-day of travel and five-hour time change undoubtedly took their toll on her body. “I also did a lot of stuff when I got there,” she said. “It was a constant go, go, go. Prior to Mont-Tremblant, I was a lot better at staying off my feet than I was in Hawaii. But I mean, it was Hawaii and I was at the Super Bowl of triathlons. Looking back, I probably should’ve rested more in the few days before.”
Despite relatively low Strains leading up to the race, Jen’s Recoveries stayed in the yellow:
On the morning of Saturday, October 14, the Ironman World Championship began for Jen when she entered the water at 7:20 am. “I was very nervous, at one point just before I wanted to throw up,” she said. As she started her swim, Jen’s heart rate rose to 170 beats per minute, its highest point of the entire day (see the full graph of her HR data below). After a few minutes, it leveled off around 135 bpm. “Once I got over the nerves, the swim was magical,” Jen recalled. “There was a moment when a school of spinner dolphins passed by and I stopped for a second to take it all in.”
Jen finished her swim and got on the bike at 8:49 am. Her heart rate spiked once again, this time hitting 169. She credited an adrenaline rush from moving on to the second stage of the race. A short time later, it steadied in the 140 range.",10/31/17

what-does-your-heart-rate-data-look-like-during-the-ironman-world-championship,Heart Rate Monitors For Triathletes: Data at the Ironman,"This past summer, triathlete and coach Jen Rulon told us the story of how she accomplished her life-long goal–to qualify for the Ironman World Championship in Kona, Hawaii. She described the countless hours of hard work she put in, and the instrumental role WHOOP played in her training.
On October 14, Jen’s dream became a reality. She completed the Ironman (2.4 miles swimming, 112 biking and 26.2 running) in 12 hours, 20 minutes and 49 seconds. “At first I was a bit disappointed with my time,” she said. “I was hoping for 11:30 and was 50 minutes off that pace. But then I thought ‘Wait a minute, I just finished the Ironman World Championship. I can’t be disappointed.’”
It was only eight weeks earlier that Jen had punched her ticket to Kona, qualifying for the World Championship on August 20, at Ironman Mont-Tremblant in Quebec, Canada. With less that two months to prepare her body for another 140.6 mile race, Jen knew she’d have to stray from her usual training plan:
“The first week after qualifying I did pretty much nothing. The second week I gradually started to get back into things, but my priority was really just about getting to Hawaii healthy and uninjured. To turn around that quickly was really tough on my 45-year-old body. Physically, I was already at the level that I needed to be at.”
Jen did several long swims prior to Kona, noting “you can recover from them quickly and they’re not too hard on the body.” However, she cut way back on her running, the most strenuous of the three triathlon events. “I also didn’t do any strength training prior to Kona, which felt weird,” Jen said.
In an effort to familiarize herself with the course, Jen downloaded a program to simulate riding a portion of the exact Kona route on a stationary bike. “It’s funny though, I should’ve figured out a way to include the elements,” she added. “Maybe a giant gym fan and a heat lamp to reflect the weather conditions on the mountain.”",10/31/17
what-does-your-heart-rate-data-look-like-during-the-ironman-world-championship,Heart Rate Monitors For Triathletes: Data at the Ironman,"“There was a difficult stretch about 45 miles in where we had to go up a volcano into the wind,” Jen said (you can see a sustained bump in her heart rate roughly one-third to one-half of the way through her ride). “But, coming back I was going downhill with the wind behind me and pedaling was optional. Unfortunately, for the rest of the race my nutrition was off. When I grabbed my bottles at the midway point they were warm, so I had to go with the on-course nutrition instead. It was fine, but I didn’t consume quite enough calories heading into my run.”
Her run began just after 3 pm, and Jen’s heart rate spiked for a third time. It then hovered around 150 for the remainder of the race. “I felt great for the first half marathon, but then I slowed down,” she explained. “The heat and insufficient calorie intake started to get to me. I’d been in the sun all day with no cloud cover.”
Jen’s early mile splits were in the 8-9 minute range, but over the second half of the run they stretched out to closer to 11. “When I got to the last mile, I picked it up again and started pushing it,” she said (you can see one final spike in her heart rate above). “As I came down the stretch on Ali’i Drive, I started bawling.”
For the 12 hours and 21 minutes Jen was on the course, her heart rate never dipped below 116. Her Day Strain registered a 20.7, and it took two full days for her Recovery to begin bouncing back (17% on Sunday, 16% Monday, then finally 57% Tuesday).
What did it feel like to complete the Ironman World Championship?
“It’s so hard to describe,” Jen said. “Very surreal, it was almost an out of body experience. I was so emotional, it was something I’d been dreaming of doing since 1989. Hearing the voice of Ironman legend Mike Riley say ‘Jennifer Rulon. You. Are. An. Ironman.’ was overwhelming. I’d heard those words 12 other times, but this time, at this Ironman… It makes me tear up just thinking about it.”",10/31/17

Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a measure of your autonomic nervous system and has proven to be an indicator of longevity and cardiac health. A higher HRV is generally considered to be more beneficial, although genetics play a factor in an individual’s HRV. Members who participated in the ‘Give Dry a Try’ resolution group saw a greater improvement in their HRV and Recovery than the baseline WHOOP population. In fact, members of the Give Dry a Try resolution group saw an HRV increase 5x greater in magnitude than the WHOOP population.
Recovery scores are largely influenced by the HRV and RHR of an individual over time — hence why the Try Dry group saw the biggest changes to Recovery. In addition to HRV and RHR, the Give Dry a Try group saw slight improvements in their sleep metrics, including Sleep Performance, Restorative Duration, and Consistency (+0.7%).
Because alcohol is known to disrupt sleep cycles, act as a diuretic, and lead to dehydration, reducing consumption can lead to better outcomes for sleep and specifically for HRV because the body has more opportunity to properly and amply recover.
Female members saw a greater improvement to Recovery, while male members saw a greater improvement to HRV and resting heart rate.
## WHO REDUCED CONSUMPTION THE MOST
Members participating in the Give Dry a Try resolution period were primarily from the United States (66%), followed by Great Britain (5.3%), Australia (1.9%), Canada (1.8%) and Germany (1.2%).
When looking at which locations benefitted the most from trying dry, Australia emerged on top. Domestically, Connecticut saw the biggest HRV improvements, and on a city level, Charlotte, NC saw the most significant HRV improvements.
Members were encouraged to reduce alcohol consumption – and the biggest reduction in consumption rates came from the Netherlands, Washington, D.C., and Atlanta.",3/1/23

This year, nearly 15% of adults stated they planned to abstain from alcohol in the month of January – with millennials the most likely to participate. And for those who have previously participated in Dry January, 72% planned to participate again this year, proving many find a period of low to no alcohol consumption valuable physically and mentally.
Going into January 2023, WHOOP asked its members what goals they had for the new year — and reducing alcohol consumption among the most popular. WHOOP partnered with Athletic Brewing — America’s leading producer of non-alcoholic craft beer — this January to encourage people to Give Dry a Try and reduce their alcohol consumption, or completely go dry, if they opted to. Throughout the month, members logged their alcohol consumption, if any, in their WHOOP Journal, to stay accountable. We took a look at the data to see exactly how giving dry a try affected members’ physiology, from their sleep, to their resting heart rate, and more. Here’s what we learned.
## MEMBERS REDUCED THEIR ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION DURING JANUARY
Overall, members who participated in the Give Dry a Try team reduced their alcohol consumption significantly during the month of January, on average decreasing the number of days they consumed by 25%. A whopping 94.5% of members reported fewer days with alcohol in January compared to their baseline. While most people reduced consumption instead of completely abstaining with 29% reporting alcohol on less than 10% of the days in January, 16% of members reported 0 days of alcohol in January.",3/1/23

what-is-a-good-hrv,What is a Good HRV? It Varies for Everyone,"Monitor and Improve Your Heart Rate Variability with WHOOP
HRV is a very sensitive metric that changes drastically throughout the day, and from one day to the next. Tracking it continuously, or at any time when you’re active, is not useful because it fluctuates so significantly. Even changes in your breathing during sleep affect it.
To get a reliable measurement, WHOOP calculates your heart rate variability during your deepest period of sleep each night. This gives you an accurate understanding of your baseline so that you can better monitor your HRV trends.
Heart rate variability is a key component to your daily WHOOP recovery–basically a readiness score for how prepared your body is to perform. WHOOP also quantifies the strain you take on each day and lets you know how hard to work out in order to meet your fitness goals, which in turn will help improve your HRV. In fact, we found that after 4 months on WHOOP, collegiate athletes’ heart rate variability increased by an average of 8.3 milliseconds.

what-is-a-good-hrv,What is a Good HRV? It Varies for Everyone,"## What is a Good Heart Rate Variability?
Heart rate variability (HRV) is a measure of your autonomic nervous system that can be extremely useful for evaluating your physical fitness and determining how ready your body is to perform. If you’re new to the subject of heart rate variability and would like to learn more about what it is and why it’s such a valuable tool, check out our Ultimate Guide to HRV.
Generally speaking, higher heart rate variability is a sign of better fitness. But, the most important thing to know with HRV is that it is an incredibly personalized metric that differs greatly from one individual to the next. When attempting to figure out what is a good heart rate variability for you, a number of factors such as age, gender, fitness level, lifestyle, environment and genetics must be taken into account.
## What Do HRV Numbers Mean?
Heart rate variability is the difference in time between the beats of your heart, measured in milliseconds (ms).
For the most part, younger people have higher HRV than older people, and males may have slightly higher HRV than females. Additionally, elite athletes (endurance athletes in particular) tend to have greater heart rate variability than non-athletes. However, what represents a healthy HRV varies for everybody. There are many exceptionally fit people who have heart rate variability that is lower than the norm.
Below is a graphic that shows the average range of heart rate variability by age, from 20-65.
## Heart Rate Variability Chart
You can see quite clearly that HRV declines as people get older. The middle 50% of 20-25 year olds usually fall in the 55-105 range, while 60-65 year olds are normally between 25-45.",1/30/20
what-is-a-good-hrv,What is a Good HRV? It Varies for Everyone,"“What is a Good HRV Score for Me?”
The average heart rate variability for all WHOOP members is 65 for men and 62 for women. For 25-year-olds it’s 78, for 35-year-olds it’s 60, for 45-year-olds it’s 48, and for 55-year-olds it’s 44. In general, people using WHOOP tend to be athletes and/or health-conscious individuals looking to perform better at whatever they do. If your HRV falls in line with the WHOOP averages, it’s reasonable to consider it “good.”
However, rather than comparing yourself to others and worrying about what is good or normal, it’s much more practical to follow your own HRV trends. If you’re making efforts to better your overall health and fitness, over time you should see your heart rate variability begin to rise.
On the other hand, a downward trend in HRV can be a sign that you’re overtraining or engaging in other unhealthy behaviors, like poor nutrition or insufficient sleep.",1/30/20
what-is-active-recovery-7-active-recovery-workouts,What is Active Recovery? 7 Active Recovery Workouts,"Benefits of active recovery
Active recovery workouts offer numerous benefits to your body. The goal is to mix medium-to-high-intensity training with some low-intensity active recovery days throughout the week. A 2018 study analyzing post-workout recovery techniques found that active recovery has numerous benefits, including:
Increased blood flow through the affected muscles
Eliminating metabolic waste such as lactic acid and hydrogen ions
Reducing soreness
Maintaining your exercise routine without burning out on intense training
It may also help to prevent future injuries
## Active recovery vs passive recovery
Planning active recovery on a rest day is a good way to give yourself a break without sacking out on the couch.
“If the goal of your rest day is to boost recovery, then you actually have to take actions towards that, it’s not merely the inaction of not going to the gym,” said WHOOP VP of Data Science and Research Emily Capodilupo on an episode of our podcast discussing recovery.
Active recovery after a workout allows the heart rate to slowly decrease. Doing it on a rest day will elevate your heart rate but doesn’t add joint stress that comes with cardio or HIIT.
Passive recovery, on the other hand, are the days for binge watching. Taking it easy helps you bounce back on low recovery days and it helps injuries to heal. Passive recovery may be more helpful after short, repetitive high-intensity exercise, such as circuit training, but active recovery may be a better option after other types of workouts, like running, swimming or an athletic event. Additionally, active recovery is beneficial when you’re tapering for an event. Both types of recovery are useful to get your body the rest it needs.",7/1/21
what-is-active-recovery-7-active-recovery-workouts,What is Active Recovery? 7 Active Recovery Workouts,"## What is active recovery?
Active recovery is low-intensity activity that promotes blood flow to the muscles helping you to recover. While recovering might mean relaxing on the couch to you, it’s not necessarily the best option to bounce back from your workout. Although it sounds contradictory, being active may help your achy muscles recover from an intense workout better than resting.
High-intensity activity such as weightlifting, HIIT workouts, running or team sports can result in stiff and sore muscles or muscle fatigue the next day. Active recovery can help alleviate the soreness, and it may also improve your performance.
## What causes post-workout muscle soreness?
Muscle fatigue is caused by accumulating lactic acid in the tissue. Additionally, inorganic phosphate increasing during fatigue as creatine phosphate in the tissue is broken down is a major cause of muscle fatigue.
The stiffness you wake up with the day (or two days) after a workout is called delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). DOMS is the pain and stiffness that begins a day or two after a workout. Your muscles feel tender to the touch or have reduced range of motion. Other symptoms of DOMS are swelling, fatigue and short-term loss of muscle strength. It’s caused by microscopic tears in the muscle fibers. Your body responds to these tears by increasing inflammation, leading to the next day’s achiness. DOMS happens to almost everyone, from beginners to elite athletes. It strikes most often when you increase your workout intensity or try new kinds of exercise your body isn’t used to.",7/1/21
what-is-active-recovery-7-active-recovery-workouts,What is Active Recovery? 7 Active Recovery Workouts,"Types of active recovery
There is more than one way to look at active recovery. It’s something to do on a rest day, between interval sets, and during cooldowns. Some light activity between workout days such as going for a walk or doing yoga during will help increase blood flow without the intensity of a workout.
Interval recovery (things like jogging between speed intervals) can help you recover faster. The American Council on Exercise found that athletes recover faster when working between 50-60% maximum heart rate than standing still or walking slowly during the recovery interval.
Cooling down after a workout means not halting immediately after a workout. A cool-down jog at 50-60% of max heart rate will allow you to gradually return to a restful state. Cool downs include dynamic stretches, jogging, walking on a treadmill, cycling and foam rolling.
## 7 active recovery workouts
## Using WHOOP to for active recovery
The WHOOP recovery metric reflects how prepared your body is to take on strain each day. Factors can include illness, previous exercise, psychological stress, and how much sleep you got. When your recovery is high, your body is primed to take on strain. When it’s low, you may be at greater risk of injury or overtraining. These metrics can help you decide whether you can have an active or passive recovery day.
The Strain Target helps you reach restorative strain for active recovery. Once you’ve set your goal, it shows your strain building in real time and lets you know exactly when you’ve hit the desired amount in order to prevent you from overdoing it.

what-is-deep-sleep,"What is Deep Sleep, Benefits of It, How Much You Should Get & How to Increase It","## What is Deep Sleep?
Deep sleep is one of the 4 stages of sleep (along with light, REM, and wake) that your body spends time in each night. Known as the “physically restorative” stage of sleep, it is of great importance for athletes. Below we discuss exactly what deep sleep is, what happens during it, how it benefits you, how much you need and the consequences of not getting enough, as well as what you can do to get more of it.
## Features of Deep Sleep
Shortly after falling asleep, your body transitions from light sleep to deep sleep. This is the stage of sleep when your brain waves are the slowest (and their activity is synchronized when monitored with an EEG). For this reason, deep sleep is also referred to as slow wave sleep (SWS). During this time your muscles relax, and your heart rate and respiratory rate decrease significantly. It can also be difficult to wake up, even when there are loud noises. When you are woken up during this stage, you tend to feel groggy and disoriented.
Your first period of deep sleep each night generally lasts between 45 and 90 minutes. As the night progresses, periods of deep sleep become shorter in the cycles that follow (the average adult typically goes through 3-5 full sleep cycles per night).
## Deep Sleep and the Sleep Cycle
Deep sleep and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep are not the same thing. REM sleep follows deep sleep in standard sleep cycles and is the “mentally restorative” stage of sleep–when short-term memories from that day are converted to long-term memories. Unlike deep sleep the brain is very active during the REM stage, when most dreams occur.",11/5/21
what-is-deep-sleep,"What is Deep Sleep, Benefits of It, How Much You Should Get & How to Increase It","Benefits of Deep Sleep & How Much You Should Get
As mentioned previously, deep sleep is the time during which your body restores itself physically. In fact, 95% of human growth hormone is produced during deep sleep. What does this mean? You don’t actually get stronger in the gym or while you’re exercising. Working out breaks your muscles down, then deep sleep helps build them back up. In order to see the greatest potential gains from training, getting a sufficient amount of deep sleep afterwards is essential.
The following things also happen during deep sleep:
The immune system is strengthened
Cells regenerate, tissues and bone are repaired
Increased blood flow to muscles
Metabolism and blood sugar levels are balanced
Detoxification of the brain
Below is a healthy breakdown to aim for in terms of percentage of time spent in each stage of sleep:
ROUGHLY 15-25% OF YOUR TOTAL TIME ALSEEP SHOULD BE DEEP SLEEP.
For most adults, deep sleep normally consists of 15-25% of their total time asleep, usually between an hour or two each night. However, deep sleep also decreases with age. Seniors get less of it than adults, and adults get less than children (primarily because growth and development are key aspects of it).
Learn More: How Much Time Should You Spend in Each Stage of Sleep?
## What Happens When You Don’t Get Enough Deep Sleep?
When you’re sleep deprived, deep sleep becomes your body’s priority. If you fail to get the proper amount of deep sleep one night, it will do everything it can to make up for it the next night. For example, even if you have back-to-back nights with below average hours of sleep, on the second night you’ll get a disproportionately high amount of deep sleep to make up for what was lost the night before.
A consistent, long-term loss of deep sleep is likely an indicator of chronic sleep deprivation (or other sleep disorder), which has been linked to greater risk of obesity, Type 2 Diabetes, heart disease, cancer, dementia and depression.",11/5/21
what-is-deep-sleep,"What is Deep Sleep, Benefits of It, How Much You Should Get & How to Increase It","Get More Deep Sleep with Sleep Consistency
In general, anything you can do to promote better sleep behavior will also help you get more deep sleep–starting by simply spending more time in bed. Check out these 45 tips to get a better night’s sleep.
Additionally, two other things stand out to increase deep sleep. One is something we call sleep consistency, going to bed and waking up at similar times each day. Your body runs more efficiently when it’s on a predictable schedule, and this is particularly true with sleep. An analysis of sleep data from 25,000 WHOOP members showed a distinct rise in amount of nightly deep sleep (SWS) as the percentage of sleep consistency in a 4-day period increased:
FOR WHOOP MEMBERS, BETTER SLEEP CONSISTENCY CORRELATES WITH MORE DEEP SLEEP.
The other is to avoid drinking alcohol before bed. When your body is busy processing alcohol it has trouble getting past light sleep and into deep sleep. This is especially problematic because a large portion of your deep sleep usually occurs in the first sleep cycle, which is the one most disrupted by alcohol consumed prior to falling asleep.

WHOOP tracks your sleep in detail each night, telling you exactly how much time you spend in each stage of sleep. You also see the trends over time in just your restorative sleep for a closer look at how much you’re getting and when for insights into what may impact it.
There’s also a Sleep Planner in the app which uses your natural circadian rhythm to make recommendations for bed and wake times each day in order to maximize the quality of your sleep.

what-is-exercise-intensity-and-how-do-i-measure-it,What is Exercise Intensity and How Do I Measure It?,"Choosing Your Exercise Intensity
Understanding exercise intensity will give you a better feel for how hard you’re working when doing any activity. Low intensity exercises can be done for longer periods while vigorous intensity work should only be done in short bursts, like a sprint. Exercise intensity helps you gauge your effort and maintain a safe level of exertion.
Low Intensity Activities
Low-intensity exercises are light activities that build endurance, burn fat, and are sustainable for prolonged periods. This is a good intensity for warming up and cooling down. Your heart rate will be lower than 50% of your maximum heart rate. You will breathe normally, be able to hold a conversation, and you probably won’t sweat. You’ll feel somewhere between 6 and 11 on the Borg RPE Scale.
Workouts include:
Walking slowly
Slow speed on elliptical machine
Cycling at a casual pace
Moderate Intensity Activities
Your breath quickens while you’re doing moderate intensity actions, but you don’t feel out of breath. You may still be able to speak but carrying on a conversation is difficult. You’ll also develop a light sweat after about 10 minutes and your heart rate is generally between 50 and 70% of your max HR. It should be between 12 and 15 on the Borg Scale.
Workouts include:
Walking 2 miles in 30 minutes
30 minutes of water aerobics
Swimming laps for 20 minutes
Gardening for 30-45 minutes
Light weight lifting
Cycling 5 miles in 30 minutes
Jumping rope for 15 minutes
Climbing stairs
Playing basketball
Vigorous Intensity Activities
Vigorous intensity workouts feel challenging, and you won’t be able to say more than a word or two at a time. Your heart rate increases into the aerobic and anaerobic zones, between 70 and 85% of your max HR. Your breathing is deep and rapid, and you develop a sweat after only a few minutes. You’ll reach in the neighborhood of 16-20 on the Borg Scale.

Exercise intensity is the amount of energy you expend during physical activity. It determines the benefits you’ll receive from a specific workout, such as increased strength, weight loss, metabolic burn, and cardiovascular fitness. There are three zones of exercise intensity: Low, Moderate, and Vigorous.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends 75 minutes of vigorous activity in a week or 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise. Below we’ll discuss how to measure exercise intensity, the benefits of each zone, and activities that hit each intensity.",4/25/22

Using the Strain Target you’ll be able to know in real-time whether you need to push harder, if you’ve reached your strain goal, or if you’re overdoing it. After your workout, WHOOP Strain quantifies your hard work so you can easily compare one activity to the next.",4/25/22
what-is-exercise-intensity-and-how-do-i-measure-it,What is Exercise Intensity and How Do I Measure It?,"Measuring Your Exercise Intensity
There are three common ways to check your exercise intensity. The talk test, measuring your heart rate, and the Borg Perceived Exertion Scale.
The Talk Test is the easiest way to figure out your exercise intensity. You should be able to hold a conversation during a low-intensity workout, but as intensity increases speaking becomes more difficult. During a vigorous workout you won’t be able to say more than a few words without pausing for a breath.
Target Heart Rate: Measuring your heart rate is another way to monitor your energy expenditure during exercise. To do that, you need to determine your max heart rate and calculate your target heart rate for each activity. Start by finding your resting heart rate. WHOOP measures your resting heart rate each night. You can also figure it out by taking your pulse when you first wake up.
For example, a 40-year-old woman with a resting heart rate of 65 and a max HR of 180 who wants to exercise at 70% intensity the formula looks like this:

Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale: The Borg RPE Scale was introduced by Swedish professor Gunnar Borg in 1982 after years of researching the concept. The Borg RPE Scale asks you to rate your level of perceived exertion during any activity from 6-20, with 6 being no effort at all and 20 being your all-out max.
Borg developed the RPE scale to represent an estimate of what your heart rate is when you multiply the number by 10. For example, if you go for a light jog and rate your exertion a 13, your heart rate is likely in the neighborhood of 130 beats per minute (bpm). Similarly, an anaerobic workout such as spin class might feel like a 17, with a heart rate around 170 bpm.",4/25/22
what-is-fueling-the-athlete-evolution,What is Fueling the Athlete Evolution?,"While standing on the sidelines of the Arizona Cardinals NFL Practice, it hit me.
For twenty-five years I’ve practiced the art of sports science, and seven of those years were with Major League Baseball organizations where I was a strength and conditioning coach for various teams. I became frustrated that scientific decisions, such as requiring pitchers to run distance for conditioning, were falling on deaf ears. The sport of baseball requires more than just the simple conditioning model that many trainers blindly follow.
I was finally given the voice I had been looking for when I transitioned to Senior Applied Sports Scientist at Catapult Sports in 2013. Catapult’s technology – wearable Inertial Movement Sensors – could shatter the subjective argument around athlete performance and lead trainers and players to making smarter decisions with movement data.
When spearheading the US development for Catapult Science, I had the opportunity to work with 17 NBA teams, 8 MLS teams, 2 NHL teams, 40 NCAA teams and 21 NFL teams. Catapult data enabled the beginning of understanding athlete stress.
While on the sidelines with the Arizona Cardinals, a thought hit me. For athlete evolution to happen, external load measurements alone do not solve the whole problem. These measurements provide only a part of the picture. Athlete evolution isn’t only about the ability to manage an athlete’s physical load, it’s also about viewing and managing an athlete’s internal “Stress Response.” How is the athlete responding to this designed stress?
Take this real-life example: two wide receivers on the first day of an intense preseason camp in which 92 scripted plays were run. Both players achieved almost identical “player load” scores.

Sports scientists are always searching for the answers to athlete evolution. For Stress Response, I knew HRV was a sound scientific platform whereby I could understand neurological fatigue, but never had I possessed the right tools to attain this data.

what-is-light-sleep-why-its-important,What is Light Sleep and Why It’s Important,"Light Sleep FAQs
How much light sleep is normal?
The amount of light sleep considered normal varies depending on individual factors such as age, sex, and overall health. Generally, adults spend around 50% of their total sleep time in light sleep stages, while the other 50% is split between deep sleep and REM sleep. However, an individual’s sleep pattern can vary from night to night, and factors such as stress, illness, or medication use can affect the amount of time spent in each sleep stage.
Is light sleep good sleep?
While light sleep stages are important for the initial stages of sleep and can help the body relax and recharge, a healthy sleep pattern requires adequate amounts of all sleep stages, including deep sleep and REM sleep. Light sleep is necessary for the overall quality and duration of sleep, but prolonged or disrupted light sleep may affect sleep quality and lead to issues such as daytime sleepiness or fatigue.
Is light sleep better than deep sleep?
No, light sleep is not necessarily better than deep sleep. Both light and deep sleep stages are important for different aspects of physical and mental restoration and function during sleep. A healthy sleep pattern requires adequate amounts of both light and deep sleep, as well as REM sleep.",10/3/21
what-is-light-sleep-why-its-important,What is Light Sleep and Why It’s Important,"How Important is Light Sleep?
Every stage of sleep is important for physical and mental health. While emphasis is often placed on deep sleep and REM sleep, we cannot overlook the importance of light sleep.
Although light sleep doesn’t sound restful, that’s not the case. It is the point where your muscles relax, your body temperature decreases, and your brain waves begin slowing. As brain activity slows during light sleep we experience short bursts of activity that help us resist being woken up by external stimuli.
Light sleep suppresses our senses and prevents us from moving so we can remain asleep. It’s also important for memory, learning and motor skills.
Getting sufficient light sleep is essential to meeting your overall sleep needs. Chronic sleep deprivation is associated with high blood pressure and heart disease, as well as obesity, depression and problems with your immune system. Without adequate sleep we may find ourselves unable to process new information or learn new skills and we lose the ability to access previously learned information. We can also suffer from poor judgement and lose the ability to assess situations, plan and choose behaviors.
## WHOOP Tracks All Stages of Sleep
WHOOP tracks your sleep each night and tells you exactly how much time you spend in each stage of sleep. The Sleep Planner uses your circadian rhythm to help you establish a nightly routine by determining the best time for you to go to bed and wake feeling refreshed. WHOOP 4.0 also features gentle haptic vibrations to wake you at the exact time you want to get up, or when you’ve met your sleep or recovery goals.

what-is-light-sleep-why-its-important,What is Light Sleep and Why It’s Important,"Light sleep is the transitional stage between waking and sleeping. Your body goes through 4 sleep stages during the night, cycling through these stages several times while you’re asleep.
## What Happens During Light Sleep?
As you begin falling asleep, your heart rate and respiratory rate slow. At this stage you may still hear noise and be sensitive to temperature changes and movement, and you may believe you’re still awake. You may begin dreaming during light sleep, but your dreams will likely be less coherent or intense than dreams during REM sleep. It’s far easier to wake during light sleep than other stages.
## How Much Light Sleep Do You Need?
In your first sleep cycle light sleep often lasts between 10-30 minutes, and it gets longer during subsequent cycles. On average you’ll go through 3-5 sleep cycles each night and 40-50% of that consists of light sleep. The average for WHOOP members is between 3.5 and 4 hours of light sleep per night.
Light sleep comprises 47.8% of the average WHOOP member’s nightly sleep.
As we age, we tend to get more light sleep and less deep sleep, losing about 10-12 minutes per decade of age as our bodies produce lower levels of growth hormone and melatonin. Total sleep time can decrease and we may wake more often because we get less deep sleep.",10/3/21
what-is-my-target-heart-rate-zone-how-to-measure-it,What is My Target Heart Rate Zone and How Do I Measure It?,"Heart Rate Training Zones
There are benefits to training in each zone, but varying your workouts to train in every zone offers the most benefits.
Training heart rate zones are usually between 50% and 90% of your max heart rate–from very light warmups to hard anaerobic workouts.
Anaerobic heart rate zone is a heart rate that is 80%-90% of your max heart rate. Generally, you will target this zone in short, intense bursts of action of 90-120 seconds. Anaerobic exercises use immediately available energy including glucose to fuel the body, which causes muscles to build up lactic acid. In this zone, you become out of breath quickly as your body tries to get other sources of fuel. This zone is useful in activities that require power, like high intensity interval training or free weights workouts.
Aerobic heart rate zone
Fat burning zone
Endurance athletes often train in this zone and use it in competition to conserve energy for a burst of speed at the finish line. You can also work out for much longer durations in this zone–you’ll begin to sweat but your breath should be steady. However, if you’re looking to lose weight, training in all the zones and increasing your intensity is likely to work better than focusing solely on the fat burning zone.
Warm up, cool down and active recovery zone is a heart rate between 50%-60% of your max heart rate that allows you to gradually warm up to your training, return to a restful state post-workout, or recover from a previous day’s activity. Walking, jogging and yoga can all target this heart rate zone.",7/25/21
what-is-my-target-heart-rate-zone-how-to-measure-it,What is My Target Heart Rate Zone and How Do I Measure It?,"Benefits of Targeting Heart Rate Zones
A training plan that includes aerobic, anaerobic and fat burning sessions will enable you to gain lean muscle mass and burn fat more quickly than just one or the other. Monitoring your heart rate while working out can help you avoid training too hard by knowing exactly what your heart rate is. It may also push you to train harder as you discover that the workouts you’ve done before are less effective at increasing your heartbeat.
Additionally, you can moderate your training days to take in factors like heat and humidity that will affect your exertion levels. On rest days you can target the active recovery zone to alleviate sore muscles.
## WHOOP Helps You Maintain Your Target Heart Rate Zone
WHOOP measures your heart rate 24/7 and quantifies the strain your body takes on each day. Every morning, the recovery metric tells you how prepared your body is to take on strain.
You can monitor your heart rate during activities using the Strain Target. Once you’ve set your goal, it shows your heart rate (and percentage of max heart rate) in real time so you’re better able to maintain your intended heart rate zone. It also shows how your strain begins to build and lets you know when you’ve hit the desired amount.
Tracking your strain and heart rate with the WHOOP Strain Target lets you see how hard you’re working to maintain your heart rate.",7/25/21

Learn how to target heart rate zones and how WHOOP can help you keep track of your heart rate.
## What Does Target Heart Rate Zone Mean?
Your target heart rate zone reflects how fast your heart should be beating while you exercise. Training based on your heart rate zone helps you identify exactly how hard you want to push yourself so you can get the maximum payoff out of every workout.
Your target heart rate is different depending on the type of activity you’re doing. For example, your heart rate while swimming will likely be different from when you’re lifting heavy weights.
## How to Find Your Target Heart Rate
The first step to finding your target heart rate zone is to figure out your maximum heart rate. One commonly used equation for finding max heart rate is to subtract your age from 220. For example, a 30-year-old has a maximum heart rate of 190 beats per minute (bmp). But, this formula does not consider variables like gender and genetics.
More detailed formulas include the Tanaka (208 – 0.7 x age) or the Gulati (206 – 0.88 x age, for women only), but they also make broad generalizations. Additionally, other factors like temperature, altitude, hydration, and even time of day can affect your heart rate.
Each of us will have a different maximum heart rate, so a better solution is to use a wrist-worn heart rate monitor like WHOOP that will determine your personal max heart rate.",7/25/21

Is REM sleep good?
Yes, REM sleep is considered beneficial as it is associated with a variety of important physiological and cognitive processes, including memory consolidation, emotional regulation, and learning.

Both REM and deep sleep are important stages of the sleep cycle, and each has its own unique functions and benefits. Deep sleep is crucial for physical restoration, while REM sleep is important for cognitive and emotional processing. Therefore, it is not a matter of which stage is better, but rather, a healthy sleep pattern requires adequate amounts of both REM and deep sleep.
### Is 3 hours of REM sleep too much?
Is 3 hours of REM sleep too much?
It is not necessarily too much to have 3 hours of REM sleep, as the amount of time spent in each sleep stage varies depending on individual factors such as age and sleep quality. However, if an individual consistently experiences an abnormally high amount of REM sleep, it may be a sign of an underlying health condition or sleep disorder and it is recommended to seek medical evaluation.",11/19/21

It is known as the “mentally restorative” stage of sleep when the brain converts short-term memories into long-term ones. Your brain is very active during REM sleep and it is when the most vivid dreams occur.
## The Sleep Stages
Something many people don’t realize is that REM sleep and deep sleep (also referred to as slow wave sleep) are very different stages of sleep. Deep sleep is the “physically restorative” stage when muscles repair themselves and cells regenerate. It follows light sleep and precedes REM sleep in a normal sleep cycle, and unlike REM when your heart and respiratory rate speed up, during deep sleep they both slow down.",11/19/21

There are also two other things in particular that stand out with how to increase REM sleep. The first is a concept we refer to as sleep consistency–going to bed and waking up at the same time each day (or a sleep schedule as close to that as possible). Your body functions more efficiently when it is on a regular schedule, and this applies to sleep as well. We ran an analysis of sleep data from 25,000 WHOOP members, and the results showed a significant rise in the nightly amount of REM sleep as the percentage of sleep consistency over a 4-day span increased:
Better sleep consistency allows for more REM sleep.
The second big thing is to stay away from alcohol before bed. When your body is forced to process alcohol during sleep, it has difficulty getting past light sleep and into the deeper stages.

REM sleep is the time when new learnings from the day are committed to long-term memory. Beyond the obvious value this has for anyone, it’s significant to athletes from the perspective of technical skills worked on or practiced that day–they are retained during REM sleep, so failing to get the proper amount at night can prevent you from seeing the benefits of your practice that day.
More generally speaking, there’s been research to suggest that when people are deprived of REM sleep they have trouble recollecting things they are taught before falling asleep.
The following physiological changes occur during the REM stage of sleep:
Eyes move rapidly back and forth behind closed eyelids
Heart rate and blood pressure rise to levels nearly as high as when you’re awake
Respiratory rate speeds up and becomes erratic
Brain consumes more oxygen and its activity increases significantly
Face and limbs may twitch
Below is a chart representing brain waves measured by an EEG when a person is awake, in REM sleep, and in non-REM sleep:
Brain waves from an EEG are similar when a person is awake and in REM sleep.
Your brain is almost as active in rapid eye movement sleep as when it’s awake, which is why most dreaming happens during this time. As a precautionary measure, part of the brain also sends signals to immobilize your arms and legs in order to prevent you from acting out your dreams (REM sleep behavior disorder). For these reasons, REM sleep is sometimes called paradoxical sleep.",11/19/21

You first enter REM sleep each usually within 90 minutes of falling asleep, and this period of REM only lasts about 10 minutes. On average you’ll go through 3-5 REM cycles per night, with each episode getting longer as the night progresses. The final one may last roughly an hour.
For healthy adults, spending 20-25% of your time asleep in the REM stage is a good goal. If you get 7-8 hours of sleep, around 90 minutes of that should be REM.
The normal amount of REM sleep also declines with age, beginning with infancy (when it may be greater than 50% of total sleep time) and extending all the way through adulthood.

Additionally, because the majority of your REM sleep tends to come towards the end of your night in bed (and after deep sleep, which your brain and body prioritize when you need to catch up on sleep), a lack of REM is often a sign of sleep deprivation. Chronic sleep deprivation has been linked to greater risk of obesity, Type 2 Diabetes, dementia, depression, cardiovascular disease and cancer.

WHOOP calculates respiratory rate from your raw heart rate data by taking advantage of a phenomenon called Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia.
Here’s how it works: When you breathe in your heart rate increases, and when you breathe out it decreases. This allows your body to preferentially pass blood by the lungs while they are full of oxygen. Because the autonomic nervous systems increase heart rate during inhalation and decrease it during exhalation, we can see respiratory rate in your continuous heart rate data by looking for this cyclical pattern of increasing and decreasing.
WHOOP is the first wrist-worn wearable device to have the accuracy of its respiratory rate measurement during sleep validated by a third party. In a study published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, WHOOP respiratory rate was shown to be within a single breath per minute of gold-standard truth.

Median respiratory rate has an extremely high signal to noise ratio, which makes it very easy to interpret and trust. Because of this, respiratory rate is useful for spotting sleeps in which something is off (in particular, increases in respiratory rate).
In my own data, for example, over a 30-day span my respiratory rate ranged from 14-15 breaths per minute every night except one–when I was sleeping in a middle seat on a red-eye plane from Boston to Reykjavik. My respiratory rate was 17 that night, and I slept terribly.

Normal skin temperature for healthy adults ranges between 92.3 and 98.4 Fahrenheit or 33-37 Celsius, far lower than the 98.6 F average core temp. Changes in skin temperature may indicate potential illness or injuries.
## How Your Skin Helps Regulate Body Temperature
Your skin is your largest organ, making up approximately 15% of your total weight. The surface volume of skin means there are regional variations in temperature. The skin of your fingers and toes may be drastically lower from the temperature taken on your forehead. Having such large surface volume means that your skin plays a significant role in regulating your body temperature. This is called thermoregulation and allows your body to preserve or discharge heat based on its needs.
For example, as you near your normal bedtime, your circadian rhythm cycle prepares your body by drawing heat away from the core, slowing your activity level and lowering your metabolism. This action allows your core temperature to slowly decrease, starting the sleep cycle, and prepares the body for other natural processes such as producing hormones, cell regeneration and immune system responses.
Additionally, in cold conditions your body can draw heat away from the skin to keep your core temperature stable.",9/29/21

Along those lines, we’ve found that improving your sleep consistency (going to bed and waking up at similar times every day) is especially beneficial for SWS. A data analysis from 25,000 WHOOP members showed a distinct rise in the amount of nightly slow wave sleep they got as their sleep consistency percentage went up.
Better sleep consistency leads to more slow wave sleep.
Sleep consistency helps maintain the body’s 24-hour internal clock, known as your circadian rhythm. When your body functions on a predictable schedule it is able to run more efficiently and can better anticipate the onset of sleep, which in turn helps your slow wave sleep.
One thing that is extremely detrimental to SWS is drinking alcohol prior to bedtime. When your body is working to process alcohol in your system it has a great deal of trouble getting past light sleep and into slow wave sleep. This is particularly problematic since a significant portion of your nightly SWS generally occurs during your first sleep cycle, the one that is most affected by alcohol consumed before falling asleep.

what-is-slow-wave-sleep-sws,Everything You Should Know About Slow Wave Sleep (SWS),"Slow wave sleep (SWS) is one of the 4 stages of sleep (along with wake, light sleep, and REM sleep) that your body spends time in on a nightly basis. Below we’ll discuss the basics of slow wave sleep and explain what it is, what happens during it, why your body needs it, how much you should get each night, and what you can do to improve it.
## What is Slow Wave Sleep?
Slow wave sleep is also known as deep sleep–it is the stage of sleep when your body is in its most restful state. Your brainwaves are the slowest during SWS, and when monitored with an EEG their activity is synchronized. During this time your heart rate and respiratory rate decrease significantly, and your muscles relax as well. It can be quite difficult to wake up from slow wave sleep, even if there are loud noises. If you are woken during SWS, you often feel disoriented and groggy.
After falling asleep, your body soon transitions from light sleep to slow wave sleep (then later to REM sleep). Your first period of SWS usually lasts 45-90 minutes. As the night goes on, episodes of SWS become shorter in the sleep cycles that follow. Most adults typically go through about 3-5 full sleep cycles a night.",10/16/21
what-is-slow-wave-sleep-sws,Everything You Should Know About Slow Wave Sleep (SWS),"What is the function of slow wave sleep & why is it important?
Slow wave sleep is when your body physically restores itself. Roughly 95% of human growth hormone is produced during this stage of sleep. A common misconception people have is that you get stronger when you’re at the gym or while you’re exercising, but that is not the case. Working out causes your muscles to break down, then they build themselves back up again during slow wave sleep. Getting a sufficient amount of SWS is crucial in order to maximize your potential gains from that day’s training.
Additionally, each of the following processes happen during slow wave sleep:
Blood flow to muscles increases
Cells are regenerated
Tissues and bone are repaired
Immune system is strengthened
Blood sugar levels and metabolism are balanced
Brain is detoxified
## How much slow wave sleep is normal?
Most adults typically spend 15-25% of their time asleep in SWS, which translates to about an hour or two per night. Here are the average sleep times (and percentages) by stage for all WHOOP members.
On average, WHOOP members get 1 hour and 27 minutes of slow wave sleep each night, which is 18.5% of their total time in bed. The middle 50% get between 1:23 and 1:32 per night, or 17-20%.
It’s worth noting that SWS tends to decrease with age, primarily due to the fact that growth and development are essential components of it. Adults spend less time in slow wave sleep than children do, and seniors get even less of it than adults.

How Does Stress Manifest in Our Bodies
How does chronic stress affect the body? The body’s natural stress response is activated in response to acute and chronic stress. Each of the three types of stress can affect the body, but chronic stress can have a particularly damaging, long-term impact on physical health.
### You feel on edge
You feel on edge
The body reacts to stress by releasing hormones, including adrenaline and cortisol. Adrenaline increases the heart rate and blood pressure, while cortisol ensures large amounts of glucose are available in the bloodstream and optimizes glucose usage in the brain.
Your body’s stress response prepares the body to react to a perceived threat, often called the ‘fight-or-flight’ response. This can be helpful in the short term when there is an actual threat to face, but becomes an issue when it stays activated long-term with chronic stress in the absence of acute threats.
How to help: Try techniques that promote muscle relaxation to combat muscle tension caused by stress. Loosen your muscles by stretching before and after workouts, experimenting with progressive muscle relaxation, practicing yoga and focusing on getting enough sleep each night. Practicing breathwork also reduces stress and may improve sleep.
Deep breathing exercises, like the cyclic sighing exercise, found in the Stress Monitor feature, among other breathing techniques, can be done at night or throughout the day to help manage stress.
You can also add hobbies to your routine that promotes stress relief to your schedule. Consider activities commonly linked to stress reduction, such as gardening, hiking, dancing, listening to or playing music, reading, dancing or artistic hobbies like drawing, writing, painting and knitting.",4/11/23

It’s the revved-up physiological and emotional impact of stressors on your body and life, whether it stems from the responsibilities of a high-pressure job, the desire to meet challenging fitness goals or managing a calendar filled with work and family obligations.
At times, Stanford experts note, stress can even be good and help enhance your immune function or propel you to safety when under real threat. But while it’s normal and natural to experience some stress, when faced with frequent and high stress levels over time, your body and mind can suffer.
As with everything, moderate stress is okay—but excess amounts may become harmful. According to the American Institute of Stress, 55% of U.S. adults deal with feelings of stress daily.
## What is Stress?
What is Stress?
Stress is the body’s natural response to a physical or mental challenge. It can speed up the aging process, cause inflammation, and impact vital recovery processes. Stress can have negative impacts on the body and brain, but healthy levels of stress can actually help improve your focus, memory, and overall performance. Experiences of stress typically involve both mental and physical responses.",4/11/23
what-is-stress,What is Stress—and How Does it Manifest in Our Bodies?,"Types of Stress
Types of Stress
Stress can impact individuals in several different ways—good and bad. It’s essential to be aware of the different types of stress. Here are three of the most common types of stress:
### Acute Stress
Acute Stress
When you experience short-term emotional stress, it’s classified as acute stress. Examples of this type of stress can be trigger by an application close to a deadline, almost getting in an accident while driving, or giving a speech in front of a large crowd. Acute stress doesn’t usually last much longer than the situation or event caused by it.
### Episodic Acute Stress
Episodic Acute Stress
Episodic acute stress involves experiencing episodes of acute stress regularly. One example of an episodic acute stress trigger is overbooking yourself. For example, experiencing frequent physical or emotional repeat trauma, suffering from PTSD symptoms, or being under constant high-level professional or financial stress would likely cause frequent episodes of acute stress.
### Chronic Stress
Chronic Stress
The third most common type of stress is chronic stress. Chronic stress occurs when you consistently experience stress for a lengthy period. With chronic stress, there is constant activation of the central nervous system. Persistent health issues, dysfunctional relationships and job dissatisfaction are all potential causes of chronic stress.",4/11/23
what-whoop-can-tell-you-about-flying-a-red-eye,What WHOOP Can Tell You About Flying a Red Eye,"In fact, armed with WHOOP, I can tell you just how poorly recovered I was after traveling through 4 time zones and getting very little quality sleep. WHOOP Recovery is on a scale from 0-100%, where resting heart rate, heart rate variability, Sleep quality, and recent Strain are weighed to determine how primed your body is to perform. As you can see from my Recovery above, to say I was worn down would be an understatement. And, as demonstrated in the Recoveries from that week, a 23% is well below the average for me. Typically, if my Recovery is that low I’m on my way to getting sick or I’m hungover. (As an aside, for you people that claim you don’t get hungover I dare you to get WHOOP! There’s no hiding from that data.)
Now, though I like to think my job performance is important, in the grand scheme of things, my showing up to work poorly recovered isn’t a matter of life and death. But, it very well can be for an aviation professional. Which has me wondering: what would a pilot or flight attendant’s Recovery look like after a typical day at work? Over the holiday I shared my WHOOP app and data with my flight attendant family member and her head was spinning with all the applications she could envision for herself and her peers.
In an industry that demands vigilance with fitness, there is a profound lack of science dictating these professional’s schedules and work conditions. Imagine how powerful the WHOOP physiological insights would be in the hands of aviation professionals! It’s an investment in safety and employee wellness the airlines would be remiss to pass up.",3/27/17
what-whoop-can-tell-you-about-flying-a-red-eye,What WHOOP Can Tell You About Flying a Red Eye,"I’m a California kid living in Boston and, when it comes to the winter holidays, I plan my travel to eek out every possible minute soaking up the left coast weather. This invariably means taking a red eye back, “sleeping” on the plane, and going straight to work the next day. That was my play this past New Year’s holiday and I was feeling pretty smug with the decision after a full day with friends, strolling up to the airport at a respectable bedtime of 10pm. “Perfect,” I thought. I’ll sleep straight through and avoid the listlessness of a 6-hour flight.
Fast forward to touch down in Boston at 8 am. I felt like total garbage, I smelled like total garbage, and what was going on with my hair? Airport bathroom freshen-up session did about as much as you might think (read: nothing at all). The rest of the day progressed as pitifully as it started. I couldn’t focus on a thing, my stomach hurt, and my brain was foggy and inept. Let’s face it: I was pretty worthless.
That got me thinking, how the heck do flight attendants and pilots do it? Surely their schedules account for the toll it takes to travel regularly across time zones and sleep at odd hours?
I went to a family member who’s a flight attendant looking for some answers. What I found out was a bit shocking.
By contract, flight attendants are expected to fly numerous legs in a workday, many times upwards of 4 routes across the states. I’ve certainly seen the airlines offer discounted itineraries that have two or three layovers and balked at the idea. It never occurred to me that that scenario is commonplace for those staffing our flights. Imagine taking off and landing as many as 8 times in a day, and what toll that must take on the body?
That’s not the worst of it: contractually, a flight attendant will work up to 15 hours on domestic routes and a killer 18 hours on international routes. That must be few and far between, though, right?",3/27/17
what-whoop-can-tell-you-about-flying-a-red-eye,What WHOOP Can Tell You About Flying a Red Eye,"My flight attendant friend said that when considering weather delays, mechanical failures, security questions, and any number of regular setbacks we all come to expect every time we fly, they clock 15-hour days on a frequent basis.
So surely, after a workday like that, the airline has to give them a day off to recoup before flying again, right? The answer is decidedly no. As written in the contractual agreements, a flight attendant is allotted 24 hours off after 7 consecutive days of flying, no sooner. And I thought I was wrecked after sitting on my butt doing nothing on my cross country flight home, never mind staying awake and alert to attend to the 100+ people on a plane!
But, then again, I’m not conditioned to flying professionally, so maybe with practice the human body adjusts to that schedule and those demands? When I asked my flight attendant informant if she feels like her work schedule allows her to get enough sleep, her response was a hearty laugh. “I caffeinate,” she said. “Four espressos in the morning when I get to the airport.” This is not a woman who’s new to the profession either–she’s been flying the friendly skies for 17 years.
In a physically demanding industry, where mental acuity is the cornerstone to ensuring safety, it seems essential to have in place robust, data-driven employee wellness policies. After all, the airlines are relying on their pilots, flight attendants, air traffic control officers, etc. to make the requisite judgment calls to safely deliver hundreds of planes, each often filled with hundreds of people, to their destinations globally. That’s a major responsibility, one that requires a high degree of fitness, mentally and emotionally, to carry out. It’s also one that seems impossible to do well when sleep deprived, as any person who’s taken a red eye and tried to work thereafter can empathize.",3/27/17

what-your-normal-vital-signs-mean,5 Vital Signs and How to Track Them,"Respiratory Rate
Respiratory rate is the number of breaths you take per minute, usually measured while at rest. Measuring respiration is as simple as counting the number of breaths or how many times the chest rises in one minute. Respiratory rate can be an indicator of illness. Temporary breathing changes occur with stuffy noses or exercise, but very slow or labored breathing can be a sign of illness or other breathing problems.
Normal respiratory rate for adults is between 12 and 20 breaths or respirations per minute (RPM).
Factors that affect respiratory rate: Conditions that can change respiratory rate include asthma, anxiety, medication use, and illnesses such as pneumonia and COVID-19.
## Temperature
Medical professionals use temperature as a clue to infection, inflammation, and fever. Women can use temperature to monitor their menstrual cycles. Checking your temperature around the same time each day can provide you a consistent baseline because your body temperature is generally lower in the early morning and highest in the late afternoon. It’s also warmer after exercise.
The average body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit or 37 degrees Celsius. But, normal temperature can range from 97.8 to 99.1 for a healthy person. A fever is a body temperature higher than an individual person’s average, while one lower than 95 degrees is called hypothermia.
Factors that affect temperature include stress, depression, exercise, dehydration, the environment, hot or cold beverages, and thyroid disorders.",11/10/21
what-your-normal-vital-signs-mean,5 Vital Signs and How to Track Them,"Vital signs are a group of metrics that indicate how your heart, lungs, and other bodily functions are working. There are four primary vital signs that medical professionals monitor. These are heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. Blood oxygen is often included as a fifth vital sign. Taken together these signs can help medical professionals assess your overall wellness, diagnose illness, and show recovery progress.
## Why You Should Track Your Vital Signs
During your regular visits to the doctor, a medical professional takes your pulse rate, blood oxygen, respiratory rate, blood pressure and temperature to indicate your overall health. If you’re hospitalized your vital signs are consistently monitored to measure progress during your care.
Establishing your vital signs baseline may help you understand and note sudden changes or gradual improvements in your overall health.
## Heart Rate
Also called pulse rate, heart rate is the number of times the heart beats per minute. Pulse is the rate at which the heart beats while pumping blood through the arteries. Medical professionals use pulse to check for abnormal rhythm and strength. You can take your pulse at your wrist, neck, elbow, behind the knee, or the top of the foot. Medical professionals use a stethoscope to measure heart rate on the chest.
A normal resting heart rate ranges between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm) for adults.
Factors that affect heart rate: Pulse can vary based on age, fitness level, recent exercise, disease, emotion, body size, and medication.",11/10/21
what-your-normal-vital-signs-mean,5 Vital Signs and How to Track Them,"Blood Pressure
Blood pressure is measured as the heart contracts to push blood through the arteries. It includes two measurements: Systolic pressure and diastolic pressure. Systolic pressure is measured after the heart contracts and is the higher number. Diastolic pressure is measured before the heart contracts and is the lower number. Medical professionals use an arm cuff to measure blood pressure. Blood pressure and heart rate are two different vital signs. When the heart beats faster healthy blood vessels dilate, allowing more blood to flow more easily.
Normal blood pressure for most adults is generally a systolic pressure of less than 120, and a diastolic pressure less than 80.
Factors that affect blood pressure: Diet, stress and anxiety, alcohol and tobacco use, chronic conditions, family history, medications, and even time of day can affect blood pressure.
## Fifth Vital Sign: Pulse Oximetry
Blood oxygen is considered the unofficial fifth vital sign. Pulse oximetry measures the level of oxygen in the blood. Your blood oxygen level shows how much oxygen is being carried by your red blood cells through your circulatory system. There are two ways to measure blood oxygen levels. One is an arterial blood gas test, which requires blood to be drawn from an artery. The other is pulse oximetry, which involves shining two wavelengths of light through the skin where it is absorbed and reflected. The absorption rate changes based on the amount of oxygen in the red blood cells.
Normal blood oxygen level is between 95% and 100%.
Factors that affect blood oxygen levels: Low oxygen levels can be related to disease, environment such as high altitude, anemia, smoking, and sleep apnea.",11/10/21

## Monitoring Key Vital Signs with WHOOP
WHOOP measures your resting heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen, and skin temperature and reports these metrics to you each morning in the Health Monitor. WHOOP also tracks your heart rate variability (HRV), which is used with your vital signs as a measurement of your health and fitness.
Establishing a baseline for your vital signs helps you know immediately if something is amiss and lets you see changes as a result of your daily regimen.
While skin temperature is typically a few degrees lower than body temperature, your skin plays a role in regulating body heat. Monitoring changes in your daily skin temperature can help you learn about your individual baseline and help you identify variations outside your normal range.
HRV is a measure of the variance in time between each heartbeat. The higher the variability is, the more ready your body is to perform. HRV is a valuable indicator for potential illness and for fitness.
WHOOP monitors these key physiological markers each night while you sleep when your body is in its most restful state. This allows for a controlled and reliable reading.

whats-a-normal-heart-rate-for-my-age,What’s a Normal Heart Rate for My Age?,"Maximum Heart Rate Decreases as We Age
The heart, like the rest of our muscles, weakens as we age. It becomes stiffer and less able to pump blood through your body, which means it can no longer beat as fast during physical activity or times of stress. Your maximum heart rate declines, and the heart rate you target when you work out also decreases.
One of the easiest ways to calculate your max heart rate is to subtract your age from 220. Using this formula, a 40-year-old’s max heart rate is estimated at 180 bpm. Women may want to use the Gulati formula (206 – 0.88 x age) instead for a closer approximation. Using this formula, a 40-year-old woman has a max HR of 170 bpm.
You can target specific heart rate zones during workouts. During an aerobic workout such as running, you may want to stay between 70% and 80% of your max heart rate to get the aerobic benefit. At age 40, your target heart rate for an aerobic workout would be from 126-144 bpm.
When you’re doing short anaerobic workouts, you’d want to target an anaerobic HR between 80-90% of your max heart rate. At 40, your anaerobic heart rate is roughly from 144 to 161 bpm. Keep in mind, the older we get the longer it takes for our pulse rate to increase when we exercise, and to slow down after exercise.
Your max heart decreases as you age, and with it, your target aerobic and anaerobic heart rates.
## Improve your normal heart rate at any age
If your heart is healthy, you can maintain and improve your normal heart rate through exercise no matter your age. Aerobic exercises such as running or cycling (or walking fast if you’re not able to do either) are often the best option for building cardiovascular strength. Besides exercising regularly, behaviors that support a healthy heart rate include:
Drinking plenty of water
Avoiding alcohol
Limiting caffeine and nicotine
Following a balanced diet
Improving your sleep consistency
Relaxation exercises such as guided breathing, meditation and yoga",12/9/21

A 10-year-old’s heart beats between 70 and 110 beats per minute while an adult’s is considered normal anywhere from 60-100 bpm, according to the American Heart Association. Children and teens have faster metabolisms than adults, in addition to having smaller hearts that must work harder than adult hearts.
As for adults, our resting heart rate (RHR) increases until around 40 years old and then levels off. It’s normal for a 20-year-old to have a slightly higher pulse than someone in their 60s. An average 20-year-old woman has a RHR 74-81 bpm, while a woman in her 60s has an average RHR between 70-77 bpm, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services. Athletes on average have lower heart rates than people in their age brackets. Their RHR may dip to 40 bpm.
RHRby age and gender for the average adult (men above, women below), based on data from the US Department of Health and Human Services.
WHOOP members of all ages generally have a lower RHR than what the AHA considers average for their age and gender. This is likely because WHOOP members tend to be athletes or people interested in monitoring their health, so it’s not surprising that their RHRs are lower than the norm. The average resting heart rate for women wearing WHOOP is 60.7 bpm, while for men it’s 56.9 bpm.
WHOOP members of all ages and genders have lower RHR than norm.",12/9/21
whats-a-normal-heart-rate-for-my-age,What’s a Normal Heart Rate for My Age?,"Monitor Your Normal Heart Rate with WHOOP
WHOOP monitors your HR 24/7, helping you to better understand your normal heart rate and learn how your actions can affect it. Additionally, WHOOP measures your resting heart rate each night using a dynamic average weighted towards periods of slow wave sleep. This is when your body is most at rest, which creates the most consistent and reliable readings.
By monitoring your activities with the WHOOP Strain Target you can see your heart rate in real time (as well as the percentage of your max heart rate), know what zone you’re in, and decide when to push yourself or ease back. It also shows your strain building and lets you know if or when you’ve hit the desired amount.",12/9/21

when-your-job-inspires-you-run-marathon,When Your Job Inspires You to Run a Marathon,"Tom was also quite amused by the message he saw in the WHOOP app afterwards:
“It was an amazing feeling to finish,” he said. “I remember thinking in that moment, ‘There is no way I will ever do this again.’ But now that some time has gone by, I’m starting to wonder if I might try another one. I’d like to beat four hours, I was on track to do it for most of the race.”
Don’t be surprised if his continued interaction with WHOOP athletes helps him find the motivation to get back out there. Tom also believes his experience running the marathon will allow him to better serve our user base in the future:
“Going through a proper training plan and running the race gave me a much higher level of empathy for our athletes. To get out there and actually do what so many of them have described to me in person–it brought me that much closer to understanding their day-to-day lives.”",11/9/17
when-your-job-inspires-you-run-marathon,When Your Job Inspires You to Run a Marathon,"On Sunday November 5, WHOOP Senior Product Designer Tom Rand completed the New York City Marathon. It was Tom’s first marathon, and he intended it to also be his last. He describes himself not as an athlete, but as simply a “regular guy.” His only goal was to finish, which he did in 4 hours, 25 minutes and 20 seconds.
Running a marathon was never something Tom expected or even wanted to do–until he started working at WHOOP.
A native of Far Hills, NJ, Tom mostly played team sports growing up, hockey in particular (check out his data in Real-Life ‘Fatigue Meter’ from Video Game Hockey?). Running was not on his radar. Tom attended college at Northeastern and then got a job at a startup in nearby Cambridge, MA. In that time, he ran a few races in the Boston area “just to get in a good workout.”
In July of 2016, Tom started at WHOOP. Shortly after, he volunteered to compete on the WHOOP team in a 203-mile Ragnar relay race from Mt. Washington to Hampton Beach. “I didn’t really know what I was getting into,” Tom said. “But I was the new guy in the office and I didn’t want to say no. The relay was really tough and I wasn’t prepared for it at all, but it got me into running.”
It wasn’t just that race that put Tom on a path to running a marathon, it was also his experiences interacting with WHOOP athletes. Understanding who WHOOP users are, the challenges they face, and what they are looking to accomplish is essential to creating and maintaining a quality product. Tom plays an integral role in that process. He’s spent countless hours interviewing WHOOP athletes in an effort to get inside their heads and design the best device for them.
Not only has this helped Tom be better at his job, it’s affected him on a personal level as well:",11/9/17
when-your-job-inspires-you-run-marathon,When Your Job Inspires You to Run a Marathon,"“I became inspired by their stories, hearing about their accomplishments made me want to do something myself. That kind of environment is infectious. Plus, I discovered a lot about being a better athlete from the WHOOP users I spoke to. I learned about how they train, and what they do for recovery. That gave me a huge leg up when I started training myself.”
Tom decided to try a half marathon, with the goal that if he finished in under two hours, he’d sign up for a full. “I trained smarter than I ever had before,” he said. “I broke the two-hour mark–barely, but I did it.”
From there, it was just a matter of choosing which marathon to enter. “Since this was probably the only marathon I’d ever run, I wanted it to be a big one,” Tom said. “I remember watching NYC as a kid, so I figured why not. The timing was perfect too.”
Tom began training seriously early last summer, but he didn’t let it compromise other things he wanted to do. In late July, he went on a week-long Florida fishing trip with several of his friends. As can often be the case when on vacation, alcohol consumption was brutal for his Recoveries:
“I’d been training hard before the trip, but then did nothing for the entire week,” Tom recalled. “It was really hard to get back into my routine after that.”
One of the other major components to Tom’s job is helping create the tips that appear in the WHOOP app alongside your data:",11/9/17
when-your-job-inspires-you-run-marathon,When Your Job Inspires You to Run a Marathon,"This led to an unusual “Ah ha!” moment during his training. “Earlier this fall, there was a time when I hadn’t been drinking at all and I’d been sleeping really well,” Tom said. “I thought I was doing everything right, but my Recovery was tanking. I opened the WHOOP app and the recommendation read ‘You can get away with this training load in the short-term if you balance it later with lots of rest.’ It made me confident that I was still on track as long as I didn’t continue to overtrain. The crazy part was, I was actually listening to my own advice. When I originally built it, I never expected it would apply to me.”
To no surprise, Tom’s hardest training came in the month prior to the marathon. It was a bit of a juggling act for him to maintain it amongst other commitments:
“I had weddings two weekends in October, so I scheduled my hard runs on the Friday mornings before. Looking at my data, you can see with those two weekends in particular I got killed [10/14 and 10/28]. The challenge was focusing on recovery from training in order to be ready for the next week, while also having a good time at the weddings.”
As you can see in the screenshot above, outside of those two weekends, Tom did an exceptional job balancing his Strain and Recovery leading up to the race. During the week prior, he cut back his training load and tapered for the big day. Tom also did his best to improve his Sleep Regularity and get as much rest as possible in the final days before the marathon:
Tom logged a 20.7 Strain while completing the New York City Marathon. For him, it was the equivalent Strain of a professional triathlete competing in the Ironman World Championship, and a serious Ultra runner’s third-place finish at the Wasatch 100.
Roughly three hours into the race (around the 20-mile mark), Tom’s legs cramped up and he was forced to slow his pace dramatically, from 9-10 minute miles to closer to 12. You can see the exact moment this happened in his heart rate data:",11/9/17

who-takes-the-big-shot,Who Takes the Big Shot?,"As a sophomore at Villanova University, Kyle Lowry guided the Wildcats to a 28-5 record and a No. 3 national ranking. Lowry’s squad earned a top seed in the 2006 NCAA tournament and advanced to the Elite Eight before falling to eventual champion Florida. The point guard then declared for the NBA draft, and was chosen 24th overall by the Memphis Grizzlies.
Lowry played three seasons in Memphis, but never made his mark with the Grizzlies. After being traded to the Houston Rockets in 2009, he won a starting job a year later. However, his career really took off with the Toronto Raptors during the 2013-14 season, when he averaged a then personal-best 17.9 points per game.
In December of 2014, Lowry was honored with the Eastern Conference Player of the Month Award. The following February, he was named an All-Star for the first time. Lowry earned his second consecutive All-Star berth last year, and this past summer he took home a gold medal as a member of Team USA in Rio.
In addition to his many accolades, Lowry was also one of the first major pro athletes to benefit from the WHOOP system (which he was on prior to the 2016 Olympics):
“By using WHOOP, I was able to see how my Recovery affected my shooting and free-throw percentage… even my turnovers. That blew me away.”
Here’s a five-game stretch of Lowry’s NBA numbers in relation to his daily WHOOP Recovery:
Based on what we saw with Lowry, our data scientists decided to take a deeper dive into what WHOOP can tell us about the performance of elite basketball players.
During the 2015-16 season, seven members of an NCAA Division 1 team wore WHOOP straps over a span of 24 games, a much more reliable sample size than the data from a single NBA player.",11/29/16
who-takes-the-big-shot,Who Takes the Big Shot?,"We looked specifically at two of the statistics mentioned by Lowry, field-goal percentage and free-throw percentage. Players’ shooting percentages in each game were compared to their respective Recovery numbers from the same day. We discovered a trend that supported exactly what Lowry said–simply put, better Recovery can lead to more accurate shooting.
A 50% difference in Recovery predicted roughly a 35% difference in field-goal percentage in relation to each player’s season average. The correlation was even greater for foul shooting, where a 50% difference in Recovery suggested a 50% difference in free-throw accuracy.
What does this mean? Instead of knocking down both free throws each time he goes to the line, a star player might only sink one of two if he isn’t properly recovered.
Imagine this scenario: The Raptors are visiting the New York Knicks in a key Atlantic-Division matchup. Knicks forward Carmelo Anthony nails a clutch three-pointer to give New York a one-point lead in the closing seconds of the fourth quarter, but he’s then whistled for a technical foul for taunting. Toronto coach Dwane Casey must choose which of his players will take the potential game-tying free-throw.
Conventional wisdom might suggest he send Terrence Ross to the line, who is shooting 95% from the charity stripe this season. However, the Raptors also travelled the night before, and Casey knows that his players are not fully rested. Lowry, an 84% free-throw shooter, had a WHOOP Recovery of 90% that morning. Ross, on the other hand, was only 45% recovered.
With the help of WHOOP, Casey would know that Lowry is the smart choice to take the shot.",11/29/16

Look to spot WHOOP again when the Patron ESM team competes in the next leg of the North American Endurance Cup at the 12 Hours of Sebring in mid March.",2/3/17
whoop-at-rolex-24-race-in-daytona,WHOOP at Rolex 24 Race in Daytona,"For more than 50 years, the Daytona International Speedway has been home to the premier motorsports endurance race in North America. The “24 Hours of Daytona,” now known as “Rolex 24,” kicked off the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship season last weekend. Along with the “24 Hours of Le Mans,” which takes place in France in June, Rolex 24 is one of two world-renowned 24-hour automobile races.
The grueling round-the-clock competition involves numerous driver changes and tests the limits and durability of each team’s equipment and crew. Last year Ed Brown’s Patron ESM car, featuring drivers Scott Sharp, Johannes van Overbeek and Pipo Derani, emerged victorious, covering a distance of 2,620.16 miles over the 24-hour period.
Patron ESM had two entries in this year’s field at Rolex 24, a pair of Nissan Onroak DPis. Driving the No. 2 car were Sharp, Derani and Ryan Dalziel, while in the No. 22 were Brown, van Overbeek, Bruno Senna and Brendon Hartley.
The race began Saturday at 2 pm. The day before, the Patron ESM team practiced their driver changes:

The opportunity to measure oneself against the nation’s best can be a hard reality check. There will always be someone who is bigger, faster, stronger–someone with a higher vertical leap and a better 40 time.
It’s an extremely fine line that exists between the most physically gifted athletes and those just below. Smart training habits in the next year or two could make all the difference in determining which of the 600 combine participants eventually make it to the Bowl game.
Working out harder is not always the answer. Properly managing Strain, as well as prioritizing Sleep and Recovery are essential for optimizing performance. Players who embrace this through a better understanding of their body’s can get that edge necessary to make it to the next level.",1/12/17
whoop-at-the-u-s-army-all-american-bowl-and-national-combine,WHOOP at the U.S. Army All-American Bowl and National Combine,"Last Saturday, January 7, marked the 17th edition of the U.S. Army All-American Bowl, in San Antonio, Texas. WHOOP was on hand as an official sponsor for the event, which featured 100 of the nation’s best high school football players.
In a matchup pitting East vs. West, the East emerged with a 27-17 victory in front of a record crowd of 40,568. Most Valuable Player honors went to Clemson-bound quarterback Hunter Johnson, who threw a 61-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter to Henry Ruggs III (not yet committed) for the game’s first score.
Beyond the game itself, the week-long exhibition included a Coaches Academy, team practices and a National Combine for underclassmen hoping to one day be All-Americans.
For the 100 players who participated in the Bowl, it represented the culmination of outstanding high school careers. Prior to arriving in San Antonio, many had already committed to the college of their choosing. Others used the weekend as a chance to showcase their decision, such as the nation’s top-ranked defensive back Jeffrey Okudah, who announced he’ll be attending Ohio State.
Running back Najee Harris, considered by many to be the No. 1 overall recruit in the country, opted to let his choice be known by flying directly from the game to Alabama, where he’ll suit up next year for the Crimson Tide.
Okudah made a pair of tackles on Saturday and broke up one pass play for the West squad, while his teammate Harris rushed for 23 yards on eight carries. Prior to the game, both Okudah (above) and Harris (below) trained with WHOOP Straps during West team practice.

whoop-celebrates-the-trailblazing-women-of-the-boston-marathon,WHOOP Celebrates the Trailblazing Women of the Boston Marathon,"Marathon Monday is hands-down my favorite day in Boston. I will never forget my first time spectating: It was the spring of 2008, the second half of my freshman year…
Harvard is the only school in the city that doesn’t close its doors on Patriots’ Day, so, after going back and forth about it, I decide to skip class and get downtown to watch the finishers. I am anxious about playing hooky, but I can’t imagine not being witness to the herculean effort the runners will tackle that day.
The Boston Marathon is running lore for cross country athletes, akin to Opening Day at Fenway for baseball fans. And as a girl who literally found her stride through running, this is my World Series–a truly world-class race, with world-class talent. And though the male competitors have my full support, I’ve skipped school for the real heroes: The ladies.
As I wait in the T station I make eye contact with a familiar face. It’s O.B. (as we called him), the captain of the track team. He’s a shot put and discus thrower and is about twice my size in sheer muscle. Needless to say he has a somewhat intimidating presence and, up to this point, we have had little-to-no words exchanged. But we’ve now acknowledged each other’s presence, so we mutually resign to the polite gesture of standing together on the train.
I tell him I’m headed into town to watch the marathon, a pretty obvious statement given that I’m a distance runner and clad in all track gear. To my surprise though, he’s headed downtown to watch as well. It turns out his girlfriend is running the marathon and he’s cued up the tracker on his phone to watch her progress. O.B. is animated with boundless pride as he recounts her training leading up to today and gets my feedback for how best to support her run.",4/10/17
whoop-celebrates-the-trailblazing-women-of-the-boston-marathon,WHOOP Celebrates the Trailblazing Women of the Boston Marathon,"It’s hard for me to imagine a time when women didn’t partake in the Boston Marathon. In the years that I’ve been fortunate to watch, women have made up just under half of all the runners completing the course. And yet in the not-too-distant past, women weren’t allowed to run out of fear that they were physiologically unfit to the task.
Today, the image of Kathrine Switzer being nearly pushed off the road by Race Director Jock Semple has become iconic. That was in 1967 and she was the second woman to ever run the Boston Marathon, preceded by Bobbi Gibb the year prior. The full story of Gibb’s historic run is quite a thrilling read, in fact. An avid distance runner, she applied in earnest to run Boston and was sent a rejection letter stating “This is an AAU Men’s Division race only…women aren’t allowed.”
This year’s Boston Marathon marks the 50th anniversary of Semple’s perverse attempt to literally knock a woman out of the running. Since Gibb and Switzer’s brave stand, not only have women proven they are physiologically fit enough to go the distance, they’ve become an equally dominant force.
As the 121st running of the Boston Marathon approaches, WHOOP celebrates the breaking of barriers and the limitless power of the human spirit. We’ll be cheering for Kathrine (she’s back for the 50th anniversary of her first run!) and all the other trailblazing women shaping the future of the sport.",4/10/17
whoop-celebrates-the-trailblazing-women-of-the-boston-marathon,WHOOP Celebrates the Trailblazing Women of the Boston Marathon,"What started out as a friendly chat on the train turned into a full day of marathoning. We are an unlikely duo, brought together by a mutual appreciation for the tenacity of a female distance runner. Although we didn’t set out to be spectating buddies, there was an unspoken bond from the moment we got street-side. We were going to watch this thing together and bring his girl through the finish with the triumphant cheers she deserved.
The Boston Marathon inspires this sense of community. Throngs of strangers line the streets for miles, a reverie cast over the entire city in shared appreciation of the human spirit. Grit and guts are on full display and it’s awe-inspiring to watch. Patriots’ Day is a celebration of the willpower, fight, and determination it takes to finish a marathon; characteristics that have come to define the city of Boston as a whole.
Most of us can’t relate to the feeling of catching a touchdown pass or scoring a goal with a diving header, but everyone can relate to running. Humans are built to run and no matter how little you do it, you can empathize with the physical effort and the mental fortitude it must take to complete a marathon. As such, there’s an emotional intimacy that comes with bearing witness to a marathon. It’s a human connection forged when your eyes meet the beleaguered gaze of the runner, capped with a quiet nod of gratitude that you showed up for them.
Such was my experience as O.B.’s girlfriend approached our cheering spot in the final mile of the run. I was flooded with pride and admiration as this strong woman strode past us. I had never met her before and yet I felt bonded to her; the raw vulnerability and heart of her race was moving and emboldening. The best way I can think to describe it is a sense of sisterhood, stirred by the courage, beauty, and power of the female form pushing the boundaries of expectation.",4/10/17

We are excited about the potential for this technology to decrease injuries and enhance player performance,” Orioles Executive Vice President, Baseball Operations Dan Duquette said.
“We have been very encouraged by the early feedback from our players and staff who have used WHOOP this season. One of our biggest priorities is to help our athletes manage healthy and long-last careers and we believe that working with WHOOP will help advance that goal,” added Braves Director of Player Health & Performance Andrew Hauser.
Overall, the study results suggest positive evidence of the benefits and potential of physiological monitoring technology to maximize performance in athletes, including: • Correlations Between Age, Sleep and Recovery Levels WHOOP zeroed in on determining the exact relationship between Recovery metrics and age by analyzing heart rate (HR) and Heart rate variability (HRV) metrics. • Relationship Between Recovery and Performance Levels WHOOP found evidence that suggested a positive relationship between Recovery levels in athletes and higher fastball velocity and exit speed off the bat.

The landmark study, which was conducted with 230 minor league players from June – November, 2016, was designed to monitor the relationship between physiological status and performance, using quantifiable data capturing physiological stress on professional athletes (Strain), and the body’s preparedness for stress (Recovery). It is the first study of its kind in professional sports in the United States. The results were presented to the medical and strength and conditioning staffs from all MLB organizations at the 2016 Baseball Winter Meetings in National Harbor, Maryland, at Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center.
“I’m impressed with Major League Baseball’s commitment to innovation and their data-driven approach to understanding the rigors of the professional season. The initial findings of this study confirm the need for continuous physiological monitoring in professional sports, including in-game monitoring to improve player health and safety,” said Will Ahmed, WHOOP Founder and CEO. “By conducting the largest performance study ever in any U.S. professional sports league, WHOOP has set the foundation for future research that will empower baseball organizations to think differently about the traditional constructs of the game related to managing rosters, lineups and pitching rotations.

Due to wide-spread shortages of COVID-19 tests in the US, most WHOOP members with suspected cases of COVID-19 have been unable to confirm the diagnosis. Among those who were able to access testing and tested positive, at the time of publishing, eight had consented to sharing their data with the WHOOP community. Of those eight, five experienced a decrease in heart rate variability of 30% or more compared to a recent baseline, four experienced an increase in resting heart rate of 25% or more, and three experienced an increase in respiratory rate of 15% or more.
To put these statistics in perspective, we looked at data from all WHOOP members that reported feeling sick for any reason during January of this year. Less than 15% of these members experienced a decrease of 30% or greater in heart rate variability, less than 5% of members experienced an increase in resting heart rate of 25% or more, and less than 1.5% of members experienced an increase in respiratory rate of 15% or more.",3/23/20

Times like this are difficult and can have an effect on your physiological and mental health. Now more than ever it’s important to pay close attention to the signals your body is sending. Here we’ll cover the ways in which WHOOP data is reflecting the global pandemic and how best to leverage WHOOP during this time.",3/23/20
whoop-data-coronavirus,WHOOP Member Data in the Time of COVID-19,"How Does COVID-19 Manifest in WHOOP Data? (Resting Heart Rate, Heart Rate Variability & Respiratory Rate)
As you may have already noticed, when you get sick, your resting heart rate tends to increase and your heart rate variability tends to decrease. While you might see these changes in your WHOOP data, during the early stages of an infection, we often don’t experience obvious symptoms. The immune system and the central nervous system work together in complex ways to target a foreign virus even before we’re aware that we are sick. When infections become severe enough, one coordinated attack these two systems produce is the febrile response, commonly known as a fever. When the immune system detects a foreign pathogen such as a virus or bacteria, it sends a signal to the brain to increase the body’s core temperature, causing the sympathetic nervous system to respond by producing more heat.
By creating a personal baseline while you are healthy, WHOOP can be used to identify signs of illness sometimes before you actually feel sick and potentially before a doctor – without recent data of what your personal “normal” looks like – would recognize that something was wrong.
Doctors are taught that a heart rate between 60 and 100 bpm and a respiratory rate between 12 and 20 are in the “normal” ranges; however if the doctor knew your resting heart rate or resting respiratory rate for the last 14 days, the “normal” range becomes irrelevant and actual acute changes can be understood. WHOOP members are on average more fit than the general population, making their biometrics – specifically, heart rate, respiratory rate, and heart rate variability better than average. If those values declined into the “average” range, it may not raise red flags in the emergency room, but being relatively tachycardic (high heart rate) or tachypneic (high respiratory rate) is still physiologically meaningful as it would indicate that your body is suddenly working much harder at rest.",3/23/20
whoop-data-coronavirus,WHOOP Member Data in the Time of COVID-19,"How Can I Leverage WHOOP During the COVID-19 Pandemic?
If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and are willing to allow WHOOP data scientists to look at your data, let us know at support@whoop.com. If you are not experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and haven’t come in contact with the virus, pay attention to your recovery and listen to your body.
Get plenty of sleep. Improve your immune system with additional sleep. Use the Sleep Planner to determine daily sleep need and the optimal bedtime.
Keep up physical activity, but don’t overdo it. Use the Strain Target to determine what level of exercise is appropriate. Studies have shown that moderate levels of exercise enhance your immune system while too much exercise can suppress your immune system. The WHOOP Strain Target can help you identify the optimal cardiovascular load to take on each day in order to maximize your ability to fight off infection should you become exposed.
Track behaviors and symptoms with WHOOP Journal. The WHOOP Journal feature allows you to be scientific in your approach to training by running self-guided experiments with your data.
Use WHOOP Communities. Connect with your peers and challenge each other to sleep, train, and recover better.
Finally, keep in mind that the situation is constantly evolving. What’s recommended today may not be recommended tomorrow. Stay informed with live updates from reputable health organizations like the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control.

whoop-data-coronavirus,WHOOP Member Data in the Time of COVID-19,"The Silver Lining: More Sleep
It turns out, social distancing isn’t actually all bad. As WHOOP members start to adopt social distancing practices, restaurants and bars close their doors, people regain time spent commuting, and bring their lives indoors, we’ve seen a significant increase in sleep. On average, WHOOP members were getting about 15 minutes more sleep per night this past week than they had the previous week. While this may be merely a side effect of canceled social calendars, research suggests that this extra sleep will likely translate to an extra boost for your immune system.
You can see this trend in the graph below, which shows the average sleep attained by WHOOP members from February 21st through March 22nd of this year. You will notice that overall, members tend to sleep more on the weekends and less during the week, but that on Monday to Friday of this week we averaged what looks more like weekend levels of sleep than typical weekday levels of sleep.
Just as the coronavirus hasn’t hit all parts of the world or all parts of the US equally, this increase in sleep is more extreme in some parts of the country than in others. Interestingly, we are mostly seeing that US states hit the hardest by the virus are experiencing the greatest increase in sleep, while states with relatively fewer cases of COVID-19 are experiencing fewer extreme changes (or no changes) in their sleep behavior.",3/23/20

While we won’t all be infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it doesn’t mean that we aren’t being impacted by the pandemic and the havoc it is causing. Uncertainty about the economy, loss of childcare or employment, transitions to working from home, and concerns about our sick or at-risk friends and family are causing some serious stress.
Stress across the WHOOP community is at an all time high, with areas currently hit hardest by the SARS-CoV-2 virus under more stress. We show rates of self-reported stress from 3/15 to 3/21 broken down by U.S. state below. Notice that even in the least stressed states, over 70% of WHOOP Journal respondents indicated experiencing stress during that time frame.Stress causes the sympathetic side of your nervous system to activate, increasing your resting heart rate and decreasing your heart rate variability. You can see this in one of our teammate’s data, below, as we transitioned to working from home last Monday and came to terms with the challenges of social distancing.",3/23/20
whoop-data-coronavirus,WHOOP Member Data in the Time of COVID-19,"Sympathetic activation, and the decline in HRV it causes, is a normal response to stress and has served humans well for centuries. Imagine a scenario in which you encounter a saber-toothed tiger; sympathetic activation increases your heart rate and respiratory rate, sending extra oxygen to your brain to increase alertness, and extra energy to your muscles to respond to the predator. This stress response can be beneficial – when you are face-to-face with a life threat. However, this response can be misguided in situations where mental acuity and increased muscular response are not beneficial. In addition, triggering this stress-response many times each day can take a toll on your body; prolonged periods of stress are known to weaken the body’s immune system. Fortunately, there are a variety of ways known to decrease stress like physical activity, meditation, and sleep. Use WHOOP to hold yourself and others in your community accountable for continuing to engage in restorative behaviors during this stressful time.
Loneliness also causes a similar reaction to stress in your body. So after you buy those extra cans of chicken soup to prepare for social distancing, make sure to also schedule a video chat with your friend or give your usual lunch buddy a call. Studies have shown that perceived social isolation has a similar effect to stress. And for good reason; for our ancestors, ostracization from the group meant facing that saber-toothed tiger alone. The upside, however, is that physical isolation doesn’t have to mean social or emotional isolation. Take advantage of WHOOP Communities. Connect with others through video chat, join an online workout, organize a virtual book club, or live stream a concert.",3/23/20

whoop-employees-share-boston-marathon-training-stories,WHOOP Employees Share Boston Marathon Training Stories,"The Boston running community is my home. I am inspired by my friends and community members training (some fundraising!) for our hometown marathon in April. WHOOP has taught me that all of those bodies out there on the course need their own unique amount of sleep, recovery periods, fuel, etc. to train, and even more importantly; to stay healthy and in the running game long term. When you can appreciate these differences and let your body’s voice weigh in, that’s when you truly can take care of and respect yourself.
Data can’t drive every decision in our lives–that would leave no room for spontaneity and exploration. For this year’s Boston, I will not stop drinking beer the night before long runs. I will go out and forfeit some sleep. But, I will also give my body the chance to pipe in and say “dude, we really aren’t feeling it today,” and to drive decisions based on what it’s telling me through WHOOP. If we consistently ignore the voice of our bodies, we may find ourselves paying the consequences down the road, and take away our moment to set foot at the start line in Hopkinton on April 17th.

I think I speak for a lot of endurance athletes when I say that my mind and desires always get the first word over my body.
This is because we crave the endorphins, tackling the next training phase and event, and the comradery of chasing down the sunrise with friends. The high we get out of beasting a workout, the FOMO we get from missing an epic run with buddies, are drivers in our toughened minds to hush the plea of our bodies, and drag them along for another ride they may not be game for.
I am training for my first Boston Marathon and this will be my third time on WHOOP training for 26.2. Having gone through the motions of preparing for a marathon, I have repeatedly engaged in a massive mental strengthening exercise that has sent the balance of power between my brain and my body rocking back and forth. If so much of tackling a marathon is overcoming the mental blocks that are preventing us from cultivating endurance we didn’t know we had, how do we determine when our bodies truly are throwing up red flags?
In essence, how do we really know how to listen?

whoop-feature-menstrual-cycle-coaching,New WHOOP Feature: Menstrual Cycle Coaching,"WHOOP is rolling out Menstrual Cycle Insightsing to give you insights into how the phases of your menstrual cycle affect your sleep and strain from one day to the next.
The menstrual cycle causes dramatic hormonal shifts throughout the month, producing different physiological responses. In some phases you may be more able to take on strain, can work out harder and experience higher gains, while in other phases you may need more sleep. By tracking menstruation in the WHOOP Journal, the Strain Target and Sleep Planner can calibrate to each phase of your cycle and provide recommendations based on your phase.
## Coaching Recommendations Based on Research and Data
Women have been historically underrepresented in sports science and research, which is why WHOOP studied the relationship between the menstrual cycle, hormonal birth control, and recovery in partnership with female physiology and nutrition expert Dr. Stacy Sims. The study, published in the British Medical Journal, uncovered key differences between natural menstrual cycles and hormonal birth controlled menstrual cycles.
One of the study’s findings is that our ability to recover changes throughout the natural menstrual cycle differently than when hormonal birth control is used. The effect of hormonal birth control on recovery further varied depending on whether or not the birth control contains estrogen.
This study inspired WHOOP to ask how we could help women understand how to train using their WHOOP data. Menstrual Cycle Insightsing is the result.
The menstrual cycle has several stages , during some stages you may be able to gain more muscle and make better gains than others.",11/22/21
whoop-feature-menstrual-cycle-coaching,New WHOOP Feature: Menstrual Cycle Coaching,"Who Can Use Menstrual Cycle Insightsing?
People who do not use hormonal birth control can benefit from using the Menstrual Cycle Insightsing on WHOOP. Hormonal birth control methods, including pills, hormonal intrauterine devices (IUDs), rings, and patches change the hormonal fluctuations throughout a normal menstrual cycle. If you do use a form of hormonal birth control the existing Strain and Sleep Planner algorithms are accurate for you.
## Benefits of Menstrual Cycle Insightsing
Not everyone’s cycle is exactly 28 days. Menstrual Cycle Insightsing provides unique benefits to members who menstruate, including:
Tracks your unique cycle and provides more accurate strain and sleep recommendations and gives you personalized insights on how to train with your cycle instead of against it.
Maps out the different phases of your cycle and the ways each phase affects your sleep and your ability to recover from strain.
Provides you with more insights into the day to day state of your body and knowledge to improve your performance.",11/22/21

Use the calendar feature in Menstrual Cycle Insightsing to find personalized recommendations based on the phase of your cycle",11/22/21
whoop-feature-menstrual-cycle-coaching,New WHOOP Feature: Menstrual Cycle Coaching,"Strain and Sleep Change Throughout Your Cycle
Menstrual Cycle Insightsing recommends maximizing training during your period based on how hormone levels change throughout the month. During the early follicular phase (your period), estrogen and progesterone are at their lowest levels. This allows you to build more muscle and make bigger gains than in other phases. On the other hand, as your body prepares for menstruation in the late luteal phase (just before your period) your body is less able to take on additional strain and it may be a good time for an active recovery day.
Whatever exercise you do, you’ll see better gains during your period than in any other phase. But everyone is different and if you have low energy or have poor recoveries during your period, you may choose not to work out harder during your period. Experiment with Menstrual Cycle Insightsing while working out and see how your recoveries improve.
Your cycle affects all of your systems, including your circadian rhythm. In the week before your period you’re more likely to experience lower quality sleep and more time spent awake than the rest of your cycle. Meaning you may want to plan for more time in bed during your premenstrual week to offset this.
## Journaling Your Reproductive Health
WHOOP offers a number of ways to help members track their reproductive health. The Journal provides toggles for ovulation, trying to conceive, pregnancy, perimenopause, and postmenopause. You can also track premenstrual symptoms including bloating and menstrual cramping in the Journal.

In 2021, WHOOP initiated Menstrual Cycle Insightsing, and now we’re introducing new Journal toggles to track and better understand changes at every stage of life, from trying to conceive through postmenopause.
Women go through numerous physiological changes in their lives that they can track by enabling reproductive health Journal toggles. WHOOP members can see how their strain, heart rate, heart rate variability, sleep, recovery, and habits change in the Monthly Performance Assessment.",3/28/22
whoop-features-support-reproductive-health-through-all-life-stages,WHOOP Features Support Reproductive Health Through All Life Stages,"Among other findings, a decrease in HRV and an increase in resting heart rate were observed after conception and before the first missed period. The results indicate that monitoring HRV and RHR daily could potentially be helpful in detecting pregnancy.
Pregnancy
When you log your pregnancy in the Journal, you’ll be invited to join a Community team chat based on your due date where you can share experiences and find support from other pregnant members.
Current guidelines on exercise during pregnancy have changed since first being issued in 1985 by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
But Dr. Shon Rowan, lead researcher on the WVU study, recently appeared on our podcast and said he still hears outdated recommendations from physicians. He pointed out that current recommendations from 2017 state that pregnant women perform moderate exercise 3-4 times a week and that it’s no longer a recommendation to not start an exercise regimen if you hadn’t before pregnancy.
He hears more questions about what you can do, rather than what you can’t. “We can be more aggressive in letting women know what they can do,” he said.
Former US National Team rower Sara Hendershot used WHOOP throughout her pregnancy in 2019, and saw interesting changes in her resting heart rate and HRV.
“My body’s ability to take on strain also trended down over time, which was displayed by a decrease in heart rate variability and daily WHOOP strain scores. The six months prior to becoming pregnant, my average HRV was 64, compared to the first six months of pregnancy when it dropped to an average of 50.”
Postpartum
Having a new baby takes a toll physically and mentally on parents. Logging nursing or parenting in the Journal will personalize WHOOP for this stressful phase of life.",3/28/22
whoop-features-support-reproductive-health-through-all-life-stages,WHOOP Features Support Reproductive Health Through All Life Stages,"Dr. Rowan’s study found that in the 12 weeks after giving birth, women in the study had higher HRV scores compared to their baseline post pregnancy, meaning that these study participants were continuing to make fitness gains during their pregnancy.
“So many women say ‘I’ve made amazing progress. I don’t want to have a baby right now; I don’t want to hinder that progress I’ve made.’ We’re able to say you’re not hindering, you’re actually increasing your progress by getting pregnant. I think it will allow women to have that peace of mind that they’re not going to lose those gains that they worked hard for,” he said.
Menopause, Perimenopause, and Postmenopause
Toggling perimenopause or postmenopause in the Journal will provide you with recovery insights in the Monthly Performance Assessment, so you can better track your symptoms and fine-tune your training.
When you begin perimenopause (the multiyear transition stage before you completely stop getting your period and enter postmenopause), the most important thing is to track your symptoms, your sleep, and how you’re feeling, according to Dr. Stacy Sims, an expert in female physiology.",3/28/22
whoop-features-support-reproductive-health-through-all-life-stages,WHOOP Features Support Reproductive Health Through All Life Stages,"WHOOP Reproductive Health Study
Pregnant women have been excluded from medical studies for decades. Dr. Rowan calls the practice discriminatory and says that it’s led some physicians to providing outdated information to their patients who are trying to conceive or are pregnant.
“There is a major knowledge and education gap when it comes to studying women’s health,” he says.
We want to reverse this trend.
WHOOP recently concluded the largest reproductive health study ever to advance research and help women better understand the changes they go through during all life stages: Menstruation, trying to conceive, pregnancy, postpartum, perimenopause, and postmenopause.
“The vast majority of research that our training is based on actually doesn’t really apply to [women] or we don’t understand how it maybe needs to be modified to apply,” said WHOOP VP of Data Science and Research Emily Capodilupo during a recent episode of the WHOOP Podcast.
The intent of this study is to help expand our understanding of how exercise affects sleep and recovery at every stage of women’s lives. Its findings will help provide personalized recommendations for WHOOP members based on whether they’re trying to conceive, nursing, going through perimenopause, and all the stages of an adult woman’s life.
Keep an eye out for the official research findings in the near future.",3/28/22

WHOOP has added new toggles for trying to conceive, perimenopause, and postmenopause to help you better understand how your body changes and personalize recommendations around different life stages. These are an addition to the existing pregnancy toggle and Menstrual Cycle Insightsing.
Menstrual Cycle
WHOOP helps you track your menstrual cycle with Menstrual Cycle Insightsing. If you’re not using hormonal birth control, Menstrual Cycle Insightsing provides insight into how the phases of your cycle affect your sleep and strain. It enables you to optimize your training and recovery based on where you are in your monthly cycle. Additionally, it can also help you learn what behaviors may influence symptoms like cramps and bloating, and how exercise and strain in different phases of your cycle impact you.
For example, women’s nutrition expert Dr. Hazel Wallace notes that women’s bodies change the way they use carbohydrates and fat for fuel in different stages of the menstrual cycle.
You can track your dietary habits in the Journal across your cycle and note things like nutrient intake, cravings, hunger levels, and energy levels, and learn how they impact your training, sleep, and recovery.
Trying to Conceive
Trying to get pregnant isn’t always easy. Toggling “Trying to Conceive” or “Ovulating,” along with the Menstrual Cycle Insights helps you track ovulation so you can know your most fertile days in the month for the best chance to get pregnant.
In a first-of-its-kind study from West Virginia University School of Medicine, WHOOP was used to monitor health trends of active pregnant women.

Because of this, players are forced to fend for themselves when it comes to training schedules.
“It’s all on your own,” White says. “When I’m done with work I have to make sure that I have my time slotted out to train properly without hindering my day job. WHOOP allows me to gauge my workouts, make sure I’m staying healthy during the week and getting enough rest, but also making sure I’m working myself hard enough to be ready to perform on the weekends.”
“One big thing for me is being able to track recovery,” he adds. “You’re traveling and playing all weekend, then waking up Monday, what’s the right thing to do? I have four days essentially where I can really do something–whether it be the weight room, fitness training, or recovery. That Monday morning is key for me to see my Recovery and determine what I can get into. It gauges what I do for the week. Maybe I’m just on the bike on Monday and stretching, something minimal. Tuesday I may get in the weight room, Wednesday go as hard as I can go with lifting, then winding it back down into Friday [to peak for game time].”
White also sees great value in entire teams using WHOOP, particularly as a motivational tool in leagues like his where the players aren’t together every day:
“The team aspect of it is really interesting to me in terms of being able to hold each other accountable–knowing that people are doing what they’re supposed to do during the week and that we’re all coming in at the same level of fitness and work ethic. When I think of the perfect WHOOP athlete, it’s someone who is competitive and working towards individual goals, but also competing against their teammates and holding each other accountable to make sure they’re doing their part for the team.”

He’s also a three-time MLL All Star and the league’s reigning Defensive Player of the Year for the Rochester Rattlers.
Dueling professions are the norm in the lives of Major League Lacrosse players, where there are literally no days off in season. They typically work their day jobs all week, hop on a plane Friday, practice that night, take the field for shoot around Saturday morning, play a game that evening, fly home Sunday, then do it all over again.
“It’s a traveling weekend job,” White says. “There’s not really anyone who’s doing it as a moneymaker because they’re strapped, it’s just the opportunity to be able to play the game at the highest level.”
As much as he enjoys competing against the world’s best at the sport he loves, White admits it can be difficult: “It takes a lot out of you and your families, traveling every weekend for four months all summer long, it’s a grind that gets to you a bit.”
Holding down a full-time job while simultaneously maintaining the schedule of a professional athlete is no easy task. Being properly rested for both is an even bigger challenge. White uses WHOOP to help make that possible:

Moreover, WHOOP Strain quantifies the impact of effort on the cardiovascular system and, as such, non-training related exertion is measured and accounted for in the athlete’s Day Strain. This not only gives a coach more context when she or he doesn’t have eyes on an athlete, but also accurately informs the specific recovery needs of each athlete.

“The study that WHOOP has conducted is incredibly significant in light of the national public health concerns around premature births. WHOOP has identified a new biomarker that merits additional clinical research alongside the implementation of its wearable technology,” said Dr. Elizabeth Cherot, Chief Medical Officer of Axia Women’s Health, one of the nation’s largest independent women’s healthcare groups. “Accessible, noninvasive screening options for premature birth can serve as early warning signs for pregnant people, giving them more time to find and administer interventions to improve health outcomes.”
THE WHOOP INFLECTION POINT
The WHOOP Inflection Point is characterized by a sustained inversion of HRV seven weeks prior to delivery. While during most of pregnancy a woman’s HRV decreases, the WHOOP research team found that HRV trendline inverted seven weeks prior to delivery, as HRV began to rebound.
“This initial research into the WHOOP Inflection Point could be an early screening tool of whether a pregnant woman’s baby may be arriving prematurely,” said Dr. Patrick Carroll, WHOOP Chief Medical Officer. “Women who experience a sustained HRV inversion prior than expected should consult their doctors and discuss the potential risk of premature birth and further appropriate screening tests.”

whoop-identifies-novel-pregnancy-digital-biomarker-to-screen-for-premature-birth,WHOOP Identifies Novel Pregnancy Digital Biomarker to Screen for Premature Birth,"BOSTON, November 9, 2022 – WHOOP, the human performance company, today announced groundbreaking research that could pave the way to prevent preterm infant morbidity and mortality, and improve the lives and health outcomes of premature infants worldwide. At a time when women’s health is under attack and it is more difficult than ever for women to access high-quality healthcare, WHOOP has uncovered a first-of-its-kind pregnancy digital biomarker for noninvasive prescreening for premature birth. In the United States, preterm birth is the second leading cause of infant mortality and 35.8% of all infant deaths are preterm-related.
In a new study in peer review led by WHOOP Senior Vice President of Data Science & Research, Emily Capodilupo, WHOOP analyzed the physiological data of 241 pregnancies and found that in singleton pregnancies, maternal heart rate variability (HRV) trends invert seven weeks prior to delivery. The timing of that inversion is consistent relative to eventual delivery date for both premature and full-term pregnancies, acting as a potential indicator of the likely delivery date. Understanding this change in HRV, which WHOOP researchers have labeled the WHOOP Inflection Point, has the potential to save lives, reduce medical costs, and provide more insight to expecting parents.
One out of every ten births nationwide is preterm and the rates have been increasing since the 1980s. Healthcare inequities abound in the United States that disproportionately impact preterm birth rates for black infants (14.2%), American Indian/Alaska Natives (11.6%), and Hispanics (9.8%).",11/9/22

Often times the fitter team is the one that wins. I think that really showed and shined through for us, and the WHOOP data was able to help us achieve that.”
Today, Gary Power is an Elite Performance Manager in the Business Development department here at WHOOP. After being a member of the first team ever to use WHOOP, Power was well aware of its potential and knew it was something he wanted to become a part of.
“Seeing what the company was doing with Recovery, personally helped myself as an athlete, it helped our team enormously as well,” he said. “It helped me see the value of the product before I started working at the company. It was a very natural progression into working in a business development role at WHOOP.”
Power says the knowledge he gained from WHOOP as one of its initial beta testers inspired him to take on a role that allows him to share what he learned with others:
“It was a great experience for me to be one of the first athletes to use the product and see how it fit in a team setting, to see how it improved my personal performance, how it improved our team performance and how it improved our accountability. This made it a product that was very easy for me to sell, and something that I wanted to sell because I knew the benefit it had for myself and my team. I wanted to give that benefit to other teams as well.”

whoop-made-us-quit-drinking-and-win-a-national-championship,WHOOP Made Us Quit Drinking and Win a National Championship,"Three years ago, in January of 2014, the Harvard University Men’s Squash Team decided to give up alcohol. They made that choice because of what they discovered using WHOOP, and the results that followed were incredible.
The impetus behind WHOOP came from Founder and CEO Will Ahmed’s experience as Harvard Squash Captain in 2012. In describing what motivated him, Will wrote “As a D1 athlete, I was amazed by how little I knew about my body. I would train for 3 hours a day with my teammates without knowing what gains I made. I was surrounded by athletes, myself included, who overtrained, misinterpreted fitness peaks, underestimated recovery and sleep, and got injured. Being prepared for game day often seemed…random.”
Two years later, WHOOP was in its early stages of development. Will needed a team to test out the technology and Harvard squash was the natural fit. The captain of that year’s squad was senior Gary Power, who’d played with Will in 2011-12.
“Will was captain of the Harvard Squash team when I was a sophomore,” Power said. “I knew him pretty well and knew what he was doing after school. I was interested in what WHOOP was and what Will was up to. I followed what he was doing after he graduated and that culminated in my 2013-14 season where the company was at that point where they were looking for a team to be the first beta tester. It made sense for the squash team that Will had been a part of to be that first beta testing team. To have someone like myself who already bought into the idea of quantifying various different aspects of training made us a great target and a great use case for the first team to start using the product.”",1/20/17
whoop-made-us-quit-drinking-and-win-a-national-championship,WHOOP Made Us Quit Drinking and Win a National Championship,"Power and his teammates were thrilled with the data WHOOP made available to them. “It was the first time I could actually quantify various different things I do to my body and how it affects it,” he said. “I think being able to see both the positive and negative things you do to your body and how that shapes fitness is how WHOOP really helped myself and my team perform well.”
Two examples in particular stick in Power’s memory of how he benefitted from using WHOOP. The first related to him as an individual:
“One of the things I started doing [because of WHOOP] was looking into what could help my cardiovascular fitness–squash is a very cardiovascular-intense sport. Research showed that ginseng was know to improve cardiovascular stamina. As I started taking it, I saw my resting heart rate decrease, I saw my HRV (heart rate variability) increase, I felt my fitness overall was improving over time and I was able to actually quantify that.”
The second was something the entire team took advantage of:
“Another thing we saw was that when we went out and had a couple drinks on a Saturday we didn’t just see that our data–our resting heart rate and our heart rate variability–were taking a hit the next day, it was really the next three days. It wasn’t rebounding until a three-day period was over. On that side of the equation, for us, we had six weeks in the season when we had to really focus, all of our big matches. We made a decision as a team to stop drinking. I think a big part of that was through the WHOOP data we were able to see how alcohol was negatively effecting our training.”
What happened from there was nothing short of spectacular. Power’s squad captured the national title in outstanding fashion. “We had a phenomenal season,” Power said. “We beat every team 9-0 at nationals, the first time that’s ever happened. We certainly had the best season that we’ve ever had–one that can only be matched and never beaten since we won 27-0 over three matches at nationals.”",1/20/17
whoop-mlb-part-1-effects-of-travel,Effects of Travel,"NATIONAL HARBOR, MD – December 7, 2016 – WHOOP, the human performance optimization company, today announced the results of a performance study involving minor league players from nine Major League Baseball (MLB) organizations. The landmark study, which was conducted with 230 minor league players from June – November, 2016, was designed to monitor the relationship between physiological status and performance, using quantifiable data capturing physiological stress on professional athletes (Strain), and the body’s preparedness for stress (Recovery). It is the first study of its kind in professional sports in the United States. The results were presented to the medical and strength and conditioning staffs from all MLB organizations at the 2016 Baseball Winter Meetings in National Harbor, Maryland, at Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center.
“I’m impressed with Major League Baseball’s commitment to innovation and their data-driven approach to understanding the rigors of the professional season. The initial findings of this study confirm the need for continuous physiological monitoring in professional sports, including in-game monitoring to improve player health and safety,” said Will Ahmed, WHOOP Founder and CEO. “By conducting the largest performance study ever in any U.S. professional sports league, WHOOP has set the foundation for future research that will empower baseball organizations to think differently about the traditional constructs of the game related to managing rosters, lineups and pitching rotations. The teams that embrace this culture of performance-enhancing data will have a distinct advantage.”",12/8/16

whoop-performance-coach-build-trust-nba-players,How WHOOP Helps Me Build Trust with NBA Players,"It’s not anyone’s fault, it’s just part of the training culture that gets them there. They’re on the court year-round at an early age, playing as much as possible. Many of them don’t have any weightlifting programs in high school, and then they go to college and they’re one and done, because that’s just what happens these days. When is what I do ever talked about in that scenario?
At the NBA level, it can be difficult to get across to them because they think “I made it here without doing any of this stuff, why should I start now?” It really takes a special kind of communicator to enable these guys to see the benefits. And as I said before, WHOOP can be very useful in that regard.
Because of the success I’d had with my guy, he got the whole team up and running on WHOOP. It was really exciting to see the players’ reactions when the entire squad was exposed to this powerful data.
Sleep is such a huge indicator of performance, and several of them learned right off the bat that they needed to improve the quantity and quality of their sleep. Beyond the obvious, like going out late or drinking alcohol, WHOOP helped bring to focus habits that negatively impact their sleep. For example, many pro athletes aren’t aware that the blue light that seeps through their TVs, phones and laptops triggers the hormone that keeps them awake, or that watching a scary movie or show that gets them going physiologically can create an environment internally that’s not restful.
Making these “Aha!” moments is critical. It may not change their behavior completely, but at least it’s on their minds now, at least they’re thinking twice about what they do at night. That’s how valuable the WHOOP can be.",5/11/18
whoop-performance-coach-build-trust-nba-players,How WHOOP Helps Me Build Trust with NBA Players,"The Strain and Recovery metrics have been eye-opening for the team as well, giving the guys an opportunity to better comprehend the various stressors they subject their bodies to. WHOOP allows them to see how things like eating fries or sugary foods impact their Recovery, or how a hard workout in the gym might create as much Strain as playing a game. It lets them know when a recovery session might be what their bodies need, or some light skill training as opposed to beating themselves up in practice.
I’m not a great sleeper myself, and wearing WHOOP helps me ask the right questions and search for answers–how to improve my heart rate variability, lower my resting heart rate, etc. Then I can use these answers to help out others, which is what I’m all about. WHOOP is making me better all around, both in terms of my own physiologically, and as a performance coach.

whoop-performance-coach-build-trust-nba-players,How WHOOP Helps Me Build Trust with NBA Players,"I first started using WHOOP almost two years ago. As a Performance Coach for professional and other elite athletes, I like to stay on top of all the latest technology. I’ve tried just about every wearable device out there, but WHOOP is the one that to this day never leaves my wrist. For more on my background and how I got hooked on WHOOP in the first place, check out this story on The Locker from February of 2017, Behind the Scenes with an NBA Performance Coach.
Before I start working with an athlete, I want to make sure they have the right tools in order for us to accomplish what we’re trying to do. WHOOP has become one of those essential tools, thanks to its ability to provide actionable objective data on the athlete. Having this data enables us to know if the strategies we put in place for things like improved nutrition, sleep and injury recovery are actually working.
Tennis player Nicole Gibbs is a perfect example. Nicole wasn’t sleeping well, so we began implementing a variety of techniques, ranging from blackout curtains to chamomile tea before bed. By viewing her WHOOP data, we could see which methods had positive impacts on her sleep. Eventually her disturbances decreased, as did her time awake in bed, and she started sleeping much more efficiently.
Being able to track my daily sleep performance and weekly sleep trends on @whoop makes a huge difference. Whoop tells me exactly how much sleep I got, and how much time I spent in each sleep cycle. The day before the Australian Open I achieved 100% of my sleep need, which helped me prepare for the day ahead. ???

whoop-performance-coach-build-trust-nba-players,How WHOOP Helps Me Build Trust with NBA Players,"The key thing with pro athletes is that they have to realize you’re trying to collaborate with them. You can’t just tell them what to do and expect them to do it. It’s easy to say “You need more of this,” or “You need less of this to be better,” but it’s hard to get them to really buy in. By quantifying daily strain, nightly sleep and next-day recovery, WHOOP shows them how everything they do affects their bodies 24/7.
It’s much easier to create a sense of trust with an athlete when they can see the results of the work we’re doing right there in front of them (literally, on their phone). That trust is crucial for me. Building relationships is one of the most important parts of my job and a huge reason for why I am where I am today.
A few years ago, I took a long term deal with an NBA player to oversee his performance development. I’ve been working with him one-on-one for some time now, it’s been an enormous opportunity for my career. On the strength of that relationship, this season I was given the chance to consult for his entire team.
I gave up my gym in Sherman Oaks, CA and moved across the country to New Orleans, LA. That was a really tough decision for me, but it was a necessary part of the process of continuing to get better at what I’m doing. Now I’m in the NBA, rubbing elbows with all the coaches and trainers on a daily basis. It’s an unbelievable experience that’s giving me so much to grow on.

whoop-podcast-no-1-david-stern-nba-commissioner-emeritus,"Podcast No. 1: David Stern, NBA Commissioner Emeritus","My first guest on the WHOOP Podcast is David Stern.
David served as commissioner of the National Basketball Association for 30 years, during which time the NBA became one of the most successful leagues in the world and he was one of the most powerful men in all of sports.
When David and I first met, I pitched him on why I thought recovery and sleep would be critical to understanding pro sports schedules over time and how I thought data could solve questions about keeping our favorite athletes healthy for longer. To my surprise, David was finishing a lot of my sentences for me, he seemed to have been thinking about these topics for a long, long time.
I’ve been fortunate to get to know David through our work together on WHOOP, where he is an advisor and an investor. His amazing career does not seem to be slowing down, as he’s become a notable investor across sports and technology.
In this conversation we talk about David’s career as commissioner, the challenges he faced and how he overcame them, sports and its overlap with politics, social media, gambling, cannabis, and how he suspended a player for kneeling during the national anthem 20 years before Colin Kaepernick. Lastly, we predict the future of technology and how it may affect sports.
I hope you enjoy this conversation as much as I did.",12/5/18

In addition to validating WHOOP 3.0 as providing the most accurate HR and HRV measurements of any wearables in the study, researchers also tested sleep tracking capabilities compared to gold-standard PSG data.
WHOOP and other devices like Apple Watch and Oura Ring calculate sleep via photoplethysmography (PPG), a technique that involves measuring blood flow by assessing superficial changes in blood volume. When you shine specific wavelengths of light onto the skin, blood volume can be measured by looking at the light reflected back from our skin since blood absorbs specific colors and reflects others. Once blood flow is measured, we can then derive heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate, all of which are used in the WHOOP sleep detection and staging algorithm.
Among all wearables in the study with PPG sensors, WHOOP had the greatest agreement with gold-standard PSG-derived REM and slow wave sleep (SWS) measurements. WHOOP was also found to be excellent in identifying sleep overall.
In reviewing the four stages of sleep, REM sleep is when your brain is restored and SWS sleep is when your muscles repair and grow. Those two stages make up restorative sleep which is essential for recovery. WHOOP is able to combine its industry-leading accuracy in classifying restorative sleep with actionable, personalized insights to help people improve their health.",10/27/22
whoop-proven-most-accurate-wearable-in-heart-rate-heart-rate-variability-measurements,WHOOP Proven Most Accurate Wearable in Heart Rate & Heart Rate Variability Measurements,"Wearable technology has the power to help people better understand their bodies and improve their health through personalized insights. However, recommendations across sleep, recovery, and training are only actionable if the underlying physiological data are accurate and reliable. Heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate (HR) are two metrics for which accuracy and reliability are vital as they are at the heart of all of the WHOOP scores.
The Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) funded an independent, third-party study conducted by Central Queensland University (CQUniversity) which was recently published in Sensors, a leading international, peer-reviewed journal, examining the accuracy of six different wearable devices for estimating HR, HRV, and sleep.
The study found that WHOOP is 99.7% accurate in measuring heart rate and 99% accurate* in measuring heart rate variability – levels of accuracy that surpassed all other wearables in the study. By contrast, other wearables scored between 41% and 96% in HR accuracy and 24% and 69% in HRV accuracy. The study also found that WHOOP was excellent in identifying sleep when compared to the gold-standard polysomnography (PSG) and outperformed the other devices in calculating total time asleep.
AIS also funded a second study published in Sensors focused specifically on the reliability of WHOOP 3.0 for use in guiding training. This new research reviewed the day-to-day variability of HR and HRV, finding that WHOOP measurements also had a high level of reliability.",10/27/22

In a second recent, independent, third-party study, AIS sought to determine the reliability of HR and HRV measurements by WHOOP to gauge athlete’s readiness to perform in everyday use. Researchers monitored athletes wearing WHOOP over a 16-week period, comparing their WHOOP automated readings to manual data collection.
Readiness to perform is especially important for athletes and their coaches — by better understanding the impact of stress, coaches can prioritize recovery and tailor training protocols to avoid overtraining. WHOOP performed well compared to manual readings in a much more convenient form factor.
According to the study findings, “WHOOP allows for frequent and convenient measurement of HR and HRV” and it can be “confidently utilised by sport and exercise science practitioners to record HR and HRV in practical settings.”",10/27/22

AIS is a government-funded agency and global leader in high performance, supporting Australian athletes on their journey to achieve international success. CQUniversity independently examined the validity of six commonly used wearables (WHOOP 3.0, Oura Ring Generation 2, Apple Watch S6, Garmin Forerunner 245 Music, Polar Vantage V, and Somfit) for assessing sleep, heart rate, and heart rate variability during sleep.
The study was conducted at The Sleep Lab at CQUniversity’s Appleton Institute for Behavioural Sciences in Wayville, South Australia and participants were fitted with all six wearable devices along with ECG and polysomnography (PSG), the gold-standard of sleep tracking. It’s often challenging to compare the accuracy of wearables across multiple studies as each one may have a different design and population. By having every participant wear all devices simultaneously, this new research provides a clean view of how each wearable performs under truly equivalent conditions.",10/27/22
whoop-proven-most-accurate-wearable-in-heart-rate-heart-rate-variability-measurements,WHOOP Proven Most Accurate Wearable in Heart Rate & Heart Rate Variability Measurements,"VALIDATING ACCURACY: HEART RATE AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY
The study found that WHOOP 3.0 was the most accurate of the wearables evaluated in measuring HR compared to the gold-standard ECG-derived heart rate. WHOOP had the smallest errors in measurement with a standard deviation in data of 1 beat per minute (bpm) while the other wearables ranged from 2.1 to 12.8 bpms.
A Bland-Altman plot is a simple way to visualize the differences between two quantitative measurements. In the below analysis of HR measurements from the wearables in the study, the X-axis shows the gold-standard measured data from each study participant. The Y-axis shows the difference between that gold-standard and what each device reported.
Any data clustering along the flat line at zero were perfect (i.e. the device calculated the same value as ECG) and errors are shown above and below that line. In comparison to other leading wearables, WHOOP 3.0 clearly delivered the most accurate HR measurements.
WHOOP also had by far the smallest error in HRV with a standard deviation of 3.9 milliseconds (ms) while other wearables ranged from 28.1 to 46.9 ms.
The analysis of HRV clearly shows that WHOOP excelled in measuring HRV while other wearables were unreliable in identifying accurate measurements compared to gold-standard. Notably, several other wearables struggled to measure higher HRVs – with some even underestimating some values by 200 ms.",10/27/22

The validation provided by both studies from the Australian Institute of Sport underscore the quality of WHOOP measurements that underpin the personalized recommendations we provide to our members.
We’ve built upon the industry-leading accuracy in WHOOP 3.0 as a foundation for WHOOP 4.0. In addition to designing hardware that is 33% smaller than WHOOP 3.0, we aligned on an upgraded sensor configuration that contains 5 LEDs (three green, one red, and one infrared) and 4 photodiodes to further improve accuracy.
Research and development was conducted at WHOOP Labs and in real-world environments to test WHOOP 4.0 against a variety of member use cases. Diversity in study participants was also essential to ensure optimal performance in all conditions, including people of varying ages, body types, fitness levels, skin tones, genders, and handedness.
Thousands of people participated in data collections for WHOOP 4.0 prior to its launch, resulting in more than 20,000 data sets pairing WHOOP with measurements from chest straps and ECGs. The WHOOP 4.0 trial process included more than 50 million heart beats which enabled our signal processing team to refine and train our algorithms for even more accurate heart rate measurements.
WHOOP continues to invest in ongoing studies – both in person and virtually – to develop new features and enhance proprietary algorithms for further validations. WHOOP is committed to providing the most accurate, industry-leading wearable technology in addition to a best-in-class membership experience.

whoop-speaks-at-nato-conference-on-performance-optimization-for-the-tactical-athlete,WHOOP Speaks at NATO Conference on Performance Optimization for Tactical Athletes,"While many of the current programs for tactical athletes involve high-level strength and conditioning coaches, technology is being underutilized. “They are trying to understand what metrics are going to be useful to their operators and to the people who are making decisions on how they train, how they sleep, how they eat, how they should be recovering,” Holmes-Winn said. “At the moment, they don’t have a practical way to monitor the physiology of their tactical athletes. They’re looking for technology that can be worn all the time and can measure the things that they are interested in understanding more fully.”
Heart rate variability (HRV), in particular, was a hot-button topic at the conference, according to Holmes-Winn: “there has been significant research in the last 10 years that suggests reduced resting HRV is associated with increased vulnerability to distress, delayed physiology recovery following stress exposure, and diminished emotion regulation. As such, HRV has really climbed the ladder as a potentially potent biomarker of general stress and health. Bottom line, the folks in the room are serious about understanding the readiness of their tactical athletes and measuring HRV is a key piece of the puzzle.”
WHOOP was the final speaker at the three-day event. “One of the things I saw in a lot of the speeches leading up to ours was that they were positioning very well for WHOOP,” Power said.
One presenter discussed the inaccuracies of calculating HRV from a chest strap after workouts. WHOOP, on the other hand, measures HRV from the wrist during the last five minutes of slow-wave sleep, a much more reliable method.
Another of the presentations highlighted the dangers surrounding combat readiness for sleep-deprived tactical athletes. “You can only manage something that you measure, which is where WHOOP comes in,” Power noted.",2/10/17

As soon as our presentation ended we had people coming up to us left and right looking to demo the Straps,” said Power.
“It was amazing to be in an environment that is so high stakes,” added Holmes-Winn. “Seeing how WHOOP might be able to help them make better decisions and better prepare their tactical athletes was a special thing to be a part of.”",2/10/17
whoop-speaks-at-nato-conference-on-performance-optimization-for-the-tactical-athlete,WHOOP Speaks at NATO Conference on Performance Optimization for Tactical Athletes,"Last month, WHOOP had the opportunity to speak at a conference in Stuttgart, Germany hosted by the NATO Special Operations Headquarters (NSHQ). The workshop was entitled Human Performance Programs in Special Operations Forces. From an official press release, its goal was “to develop templates and metrics that can be used to start a new or enhance an existing Human Performance Program.”
Representatives of military special ops groups from more than 25 countries were in attendance, as well as researchers, scientists, physicians, nutritionists, strength and conditioning coaches and exercise physiologists. WHOOP was the only technology company to speak, as well as the only presenter without a military affiliation.
“It was a wonderful opportunity and an honor to be able to listen to the top exercise physiologists and researchers talk about the issues they are trying to solve around human performance,” said Kristen Holmes-Winn, Vice President of Performance Optimization at WHOOP. Elite Performance Manager Gary Power echoed a similar sentiment: “We were speaking to people who are very high up in special operations command from countries all over the world. It was truly an honor for us to be there.”
More from the NSHQ press release:
“Just as professional athletes are supported by an integrated Professional Sports Model that utilizes performance programs tailored towards accomplishing the mission at peak levels, special operators represent a significant investment and must perform as tactical athletes. Ultimately SOF [special operation forces] should exhibit human performance characteristics, (speed, mobility, strength, intellect, endurance as well as mental and physical resilience), significantly above those of the enemy.”

whoop-training-zones-optimal-overreaching-restoring,WHOOP Training Zones: Where Do They Come From and What Do They Mean?,"Interpreting This Feature
The labels given to each of the three zones describe the expected short-term impact of training in them; specifically, if they are expected to leave you more (“Restoring”), less (‘Overreaching”), or similarly (“Optimal”) ready to train compared to your baseline.
It should be noted that what is optimized by the Optimal Zone — maximum fitness gains without carried fatigue — is not always what every athlete aims to optimize every day. While staying in the Optimal Training Zone allows one’s body to acutely recover from the day’s training stimulus, the appropriate zone for an athlete depends on his short- and long-term goals.
Tapering–the act of acutely reducing training load to reduce fatigue prior to competition–increases performance, and typically places the athlete in the Restoring Zone. Spending too much time in that zone, however, will eventually lead to detraining and fitness loss.
On the other end of the spectrum, training in the Overreaching Zone day after day can lead to burnout, non-functional overreaching/overtraining syndrome, or injury. But, sequencing brief periods of overreaching and recovery can create a supercompensation effect, and therefore can be a highly efficient way to train.
In short, none of the training zones are inherently “good” or “bad.” Instead, the appropriateness of training in any given zone depends on your current goals.",7/16/18
whoop-training-zones-optimal-overreaching-restoring,WHOOP Training Zones: Where Do They Come From and What Do They Mean?,"HIGH RECOVERY AS A GOAL
Athletes with high Recovery are able to have higher Strain without venturing into the Overreaching Zone. Several days in Athlete D’s training could have been in the Optimal Zone had Recovery not been suppressed. Clearly, even with the same distribution of Overreaching, Optimal, and Restoring days, a sleep-deprived athlete with unhealthy behaviors that continually wakes up with low Recovery will likely achieve different fitness gains than a well-rested, healthy athlete with consistently high Recovery. To use the WHOOP Training Zones effectively, athletes should strive to wake up as recovered as possible.
The WHOOP Training Zones are not meant to be interpreted as a daily Strain prescription, but rather as a tool to ensure that what you are doing to your body aligns with what you mean to be doing to your body. This feature allows you to action Recovery by selecting a daily Strain target that optimizes your training efficiency and brings you closer to unlocking your potential.",7/16/18
whoop-training-zones-optimal-overreaching-restoring,WHOOP Training Zones: Where Do They Come From and What Do They Mean?,"Knowing how hard to push yourself each day is difficult. This week, WHOOP unveiled Weekly Performance Assessments, and in them, introduced WHOOP Training Zones. Understanding the relationship between Recovery and Strain can help guide your training in the right direction. Here we talk about where this feature comes from and how to use it to better unlock your potential.
## Defining The Zones
Each day, the WHOOP Recovery metric provides insight into how our bodies are likely to respond to various cardiovascular loads. To decode this relationship, we created the WHOOP Training Zones, which map Recovery and Day Strain into three zones. The boundaries between the zones, illustrated in the figure below, were developed by analyzing nearly a million days of Strain and Recovery data and their impact on next-day HRV collected over the last year. For each Recovery/Strain combination, we looked at the expected next-day change in HRV; in the figure, expected increases in HRV are shown in shades of green, with the greatest increase shown in the darkest green, and expected decreases in HRV are shown in red, with the greatest decrease shown in the darkest red. Yellow areas indicate little or no deviation from HRV baseline.",7/16/18
whoop-training-zones-optimal-overreaching-restoring,WHOOP Training Zones: Where Do They Come From and What Do They Mean?,"Training Examples
Below are four hypothetical examples of training data, and some pointers from our Department of Analytics and Physiology on how to interpret them.
There are several notable differences between the four athlete’s training:
### YOUR GOALS DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE ZONE
If we were to find the “average” Training Zone of athletes A, B, and C, we would say athlete A falls into the Optimal Zone, athlete B into the Overreaching Zone, and athlete C into the Restoring Zone. None of these athletes are inherently training better or worse than another — it all depends on the athletes’ goals. If Athlete B intended to taper before a major competition, she would see that her goals are not aligned with her training. However, if Athlete B was in an overreaching phase of a training plan and is following that week with plenty of active recovery, she is right on track! Thus, each zone has both its advantages and disadvantages and will be appropriate at different times during a training plan.
### HIGH STRAIN ON HIGH RECOVERY; LOW STRAIN ON LOW RECOVERY
Athlete D matched his highest Recovery with his lowest Strain, and his lowest Recovery with his second highest Strain. On the other hand, Athlete A matched her three highest recoveries with her three highest Strains, and her lowest Recovery with her lowest Strain. Even though athletes B and C are generally outside of the Optimal Zone, they still are able to log higher Strain on high Recovery days and lower Strain on low Recovery days. Studies have shown that HRV-based training, in which an athlete performs higher-intensity exercise when HRV increases and lower-intensity exercise (or rest) when HRV decreases results in larger fitness gains than training according to a fixed plan. The results of these studies support matching high Recovery with high Strain and low Recovery with low Strain. Athlete D should adapt his schedule so that he takes on higher Strain on days with higher Recovery.",7/16/18
whoop-user-chris-murphy-trombonist-to-para-cycling-champion,WHOOP User Chris Murphy: Trombonist to Para-Cycling Champion,"However, after several years as a professional musician the competitor in Murphy knew he wouldn’t be able to reach his full potential as a trombonist:
“Complications from my arm prevented me from really performing my best on the trombone. My affected arm was the one that carries the weight of the instrument. I started doing some brachial plexus research online after I began feeling some overuse injuries in my good arm. It was also around that time that I discovered cycling as a means to commute to and from various part time jobs. I happened to randomly come across an article about an Australian para-cyclist who was a world-record holder on the track with a similar brachial plexus injury. I thought to myself ‘Oh, I didn’t know that existed, I’m going to try that!’ In 2013 I learned to ride the track in L.A. and I started competing shortly after.”
Today, Murphy is a full-time resident of Colorado Springs, CO, where he trains at the U.S. Olympic facility. Last month, both Murphy (pictured below with his right arm raised) and his three-man relay team won gold medals at the world championships.

“The team gold was a little more meaningful to me,” Murphy said. “We’d finished 4th in the past 4 major world competitions [last year’s Olympics in Rio and the previous 3 world championships]. It was really frustrating to finish just off the podium so many times in a row. But then we switched up the combinations a bit this year and ended up winning it. It was really satisfying because I’d wanted it for so long. To win as a team as well was even more enjoyable. It was the best feeling in the world.”",4/5/17

whoop-user-chris-murphy-trombonist-to-para-cycling-champion,WHOOP User Chris Murphy: Trombonist to Para-Cycling Champion,"“I knew I could do well in the 1K race but it didn’t occur to me that I could actually win. I posted a time I expected to be second best, but the guy going last was the favorite. When he finished off the podium I couldn’t believe it. I was like ‘Holy crap, what just happened?’ My team started swamping me, I was in disbelief. It was the most amazing and unexpected moment–just pure excitement.”
– Chris Murphy on winning gold at the 2017 Para-cycling Track World Championships
When he was a child, Chris Murphy’s mother didn’t allow him to play sports because of a brachial plexus injury he sustained at birth that gave him permanent nerve damage in his left arm. “I was almost too big for my mom when I was born,” Murphy told WHOOP. “I was 11 pounds 9 ounces and almost 2 feet tall. She was a 5-foot nothing little Asian women. I got stuck behind her pelvic bone during the birthing process. In order to get me out the doctor had to pull on my head, which stretched and permanently damaged the brachial plexus nerve bundle that leads into my arm.”
“The major consequences are lack of strength, range of motion and sensation,” he explained. “By my own estimate, I’ve got about 25 percent of what would be considered normal. For example, as far as lifting a weight, for a bicep curl I can do maybe 5 pounds. I can’t lift anything over my head and I can’t reach behind my back with my left arm.”
With athletics off the table, Murphy turned to music: “It was just kind of a relief for me. My mom wouldn’t let me play sports because of my arm, so I did music instead. That’s kind of where I learned how to be a high-level person in general. I went to Cal State Fullerton and got a degree in trombone performance there. I was pretty successful for my age in that area and when I graduated I had an opportunity to start working at Disneyland as a musician.”",4/5/17
whoop-user-chris-murphy-trombonist-to-para-cycling-champion,WHOOP User Chris Murphy: Trombonist to Para-Cycling Champion,"When asked when he first discovered WHOOP, Murphy remembered the exact date. “It was January 9th of this year,” he said. “I was flying to the national team camp and listening to the Ben Greenfield podcast [with WHOOP founder Will Ahmed] on the plane. When we landed I checked out the website and decided to order it right then and there.”
The Sleep analysis is what Murphy enjoys most about his WHOOP Strap:
“I’m kind of a data nerd. The ability to measure my sleep quality and quantity is very appealing. Before, I never really knew how good my sleep was. WHOOP is definitely helping me make better decisions about how I choose to structure my sleep. As far as I’m concerned, sleep is the No. 1 thing you can do for recovery, and training without recovery is pointless. To get where I need to be I need to optimize my recovery as much as possible. The first priority there is sleep and WHOOP has opened my eyes to this. The amount of time that I was allowing for sleep wasn’t as much as I should’ve been doing. That really educated me as far as the Sleep Planner goes. It’s been huge for me.”
Jokingly, Murphy added “It also allows me to tell my girlfriend ‘I need to go to sleep at this time.’ But in all seriousness, it’s helped me a lot to make better decisions and be more honest with myself. The questions that the app asks every day help keep me accountable. The fact that I have to type in when I look at a screened device before bed every day makes me realize I sleep better if I put my phone down. I’ve noticed my sleep has improved when I stop doing that.”
Murphy is also a big fan of the manner in which WHOOP tracks heart rate variability: “Another feature that I really like about WHOOP is that it measures HRV while I’m sleeping. My HRV is one of the numbers that I look at every day. WHOOP helps me understand the training process and gives me confidence when I need to train hard and recover. It helps me understand that I’m putting the work in in the proper way.”",4/5/17
why-not-make-march-madness-picks-based-on-rest-and-recovery,Why Not Make March Madness Picks Based on Rest and Recovery?,"March Madness is upon us. For these few weeks each spring, even the most casual sports fans around the country become transfixed with college basketball.
Part of what makes filling out tournament brackets so much fun is that nobody has any idea what’s going to happen. On the other hand, this can also be quite annoying for more serious hoops fans–your cousin who picks Oregon because she likes the color green and thinks ducks are cute is just as likely to win your family pool as you are.
Take a look at some examples of the NCAA tournament’s complete unpredictability so far this decade:
2010 – A young and unheralded coach named Brad Stevens guided the Horizon League’s Butler Bulldogs all the way to the national championship game, coming within inches of upsetting Duke on a near-miraculous half-court shot by Gordon Hayward.
2011 – Stevens’ no-name squad astonishingly made it back to the title game, as a No. 8 seed, no less (defeating an even bigger surprise, 11th seeded VCU, in the Final Four). Butler fell to Connecticut, which was an incredible Cinderella story in its own right that season. Before the tourney began, UConn finished the regular season in a three-way tie for ninth place in the Big East Conference.
Now consider this: Somebody out there undoubtedly won a pool in 2011 simply by being a dog lover who chose Huskies over Bulldogs.
2012 – For the first time ever, a pair of No. 15 seeds upset No. 2 seeds in Round 1–Norfolk State out of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, and Lehigh from the Patriot League, who stunned 2010 champ Duke.
2013 – Wichita State, a No. 9 seed from the Missouri Valley Conference, reached the Final Four.
2014 – UConn again took home the title, but this time as a No. 7 seed.
2015 – Contrary to the dog-friendly 2011, betting on cats seemed like the wise move heading into the 2015 tournament. Top-ranked Kentucky was 32-0, Villanova (32-2) was ranked 2nd and Arizona (31-3) was No. 4–with all three nicknamed “Wildcats.”
Who won? Duke.",3/13/17
why-not-make-march-madness-picks-based-on-rest-and-recovery,Why Not Make March Madness Picks Based on Rest and Recovery?,"Villanova’s Wildcats cut down the nets in Houston last spring, and as a No. 1 seed, they’re sure to be a popular selection again this year.
Regardless of who you bet on, it’s a crap shoot. And as much as the so-called experts on TV pretend to know exactly what they’re talking about, they don’t have a clue either. With that in mind, let me make a suggestion based on what WHOOP has learned by analyzing athletes’ physiological data: Whenever possible, choose teams that don’t have to travel very far.
Historically, “home-court advantage” has been viewed as a reflection of the impact fans in attendance on the game. However, simply avoiding travel may be just as significant a factor.
A study conducted by WHOOP and Major League Baseball in 2016 found that athletes slept roughly 40-45 fewer minutes per night following travel. In turn, their average Recoveries the next morning were also lower. A second WHOOP case study linked crossing time zones with decreased next-day Recovery as well. On the basketball court, we’ve also seen direct correlations between higher WHOOP Recovery and increased shooting percentages.
What does all of this mean? I wouldn’t suggest picking 15th-seeded Northern Kentucky over No. 2 Kentucky just because the Norse (their mascot is Victor E.

When I got to the University of Arkansas I had the expectation to be great. My father was great, so I must be great. Everyone who runs at Arkansas is great. It’s one of the most winningest programs in NCAA history behind coach John McDonnell. The program doesn’t accept mediocrity. You do great, you run amongst the greats, and you leave as a great. That’s just the lifestyle at Arkansas.
Now that I’m the “old guy” on the track, I’m treating my position as a mentor role. Initially, I didn’t like it, but I’ve accepted it now because I want to teach the young guns the same lessons I wish someone taught me at their age. Take my first trip to Europe for example. I was young and I went through customs, which I never heard of at that age, and the lady at the desk asked me:
“Where are you staying?” “I don’t know.” “Who’s picking you up?” “I don’t know.” “How long will you be here?” “A couple of days.” “Sir follow me.”
She took me to the side and I was detained for about 2-3 hours. Finally, they called someone from the track meet to come pick me up – which wasn’t fun at all and to be honest a little embarrassing. These experiences are the types of stories I try to pass along to the younger athletes that may not have this knowledge yet.

I start my day at 9am every morning and I won’t finish until 6pm. Out of those hours, three are at the track and two are in the weight room. Everything else is filled with rehab or some sort of recovery.
We have a whole slew of modalities for recovery. We have a cryotherapy, a massage therapist, Physical Therapist, Athletic Trainer, acupuncture, ice tubs, zero gravity treadmills, and aqua treadmills. If you can think of it, we have it, and I’ve used it more than once this week. Sometimes I wonder if I recover more than I train. Whatever the formula is, something has to be working.
## “I credit my success to taking care of myself on and off the track.”
It does seem like I do more rehabbing than working out. It’s because you can’t get away with training without recovery. The more mature you get as an athlete, the faster and stronger you become, which means you have to prioritize recovery in order to see the results of your hard work. If you don’t, you’ll get hurt. That’s just the reality of sports.
## Sleep & Recovery
My family typically stays up to 3am and I’m the one in bed by 10pm. If I don’t get enough sleep, I feel like I’ll get sick really quick. I need those 8-10 hours of sleep and then I’m good to go. If I get anything less than that, I’m cranky…and no one likes when that happens.
My schedule isn’t set in stone, though. Somedays, in the middle of the scorching sun, we’ll work out harder than expected. After a day like that, I find myself sleeping 10 or 11 hours in order to recover from the strain. It just depends on my workload. However, at the end of the day the rule of thumb is this:

After a nights sleep, WHOOP gave me my continuous heart rate throughout the night, my heart rate variability, my resting heart rate, my total time asleep, my sleep latency, disturbances, 4 levels of my sleep cycles, and my total time in bed.
To me, that was pretty cool, and I wasn’t even paying attention to the performance side of things yet. On the Strain side, WHOOP lets me know how hard I can go today based off of how well I recovered from the night before. This device gives me the performance data needed to pick and choose the right days to work out the hardest, allowing me to capitalize on my performance.
Now that I have this WHOOP data, I can show the younger athletes what it’s like to overtrain, and how they can leverage recovery in order to optimize their performance on the track.

He’s also a research fellow at the Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, and is the lead author of a recently published study on the impact of prior sleep-wake behaviors on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Is sleeping better for mental health something the average person should be thinking about on a regular basis?
Mark Czeisler: Absolutely, yes. I think about it from two perspectives. First, even in a state of health, there are benefits of sleep for mental performance, like attention and cognition. And then also the consolidation of memories and emotional processing happens during sleep.
And then secondly, for someone who is in a position where they are living with either a sleep disorder or a mental health condition, there’s a strong bi-directional relationship between sleep and mental health–75% of people who have depressive disorder have symptoms of insomnia. The impaired sleep may be contributing to the depression or the depression is leading to impaired sleep, with a combination of both of those factors occurring in most cases.",5/20/22
why-sleep-is-crucial-for-mental-health,Why Sleep is Crucial for Your Mental Health,"Study Findings on Mental Health Benefits of Sleep Consistency
What were the key learnings from the COVID Resilience Project about sleep and mental health (particularly sleep consistency), and how people’s sleep habits pre-pandemic benefited them during it?
People with sufficient sleep duration and high consistency before the pandemic had lower odds of experiencing adverse mental health symptoms in the early months of the pandemic, even if their sleep habits got worse during the pandemic.
Those findings were particularly exciting because they demonstrate that at some level that you can prepare and have a “bank” built up, and then in the face of profound stressors or life events – even to the likes of a pandemic – you can fall back to an extent on prior health behaviors, including sleep. That was really encouraging.
The study found that increased sleep duration and consistency decreased the chances of mental health decline in several areas.
What is one thing about mental health you feel is critically important that most of us probably don’t realize?
MC: Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. It’s a really high-magnitude health condition that we’re talking about and that’s depression alone, not including all other mental health conditions.
Also, roughly half of all mental health conditions start by the mid teens, and 75% start by the mid 20s. Those years are very formative, so thinking about having support and optimizing a lot of healthy behaviors during the first decades of life is so important for the prevention of the onset of mental health conditions. It’s something that people live with for a very long time, which is part of the reason why it is a leading cause of disability because it’s with you for life.

why-sleep-is-crucial-for-mental-health,Why Sleep is Crucial for Your Mental Health,"Relationship Between Sleep and Mental Health
What are your top 3 things to keep in mind when it comes to sleep’s impact on mental health?
MC: First, I think that there are three pillars of sleep–consistency, duration, and quality, they’re all key elements. Part 1 is optimizing those elements. Screening for sleep conditions or circadian conditions can help. For example, 80% of cases of obstructive sleep apnea, which can have all sorts of consequences, are undiagnosed or untreated.

Screening for sleep conditions or circadian conditions can help. For example, 80% of cases of obstructive sleep apnea, which can have all sorts of consequences, are undiagnosed or untreated.
Part 2 is that there are going to be ups and downs in life. We talk about optimizing sleep, mental health, nutrition, exercise, etc, but recognizing that there are going to be times when achieving the ideal routines and metrics for all of those is not going to be possible.
That’s why the finding that prior behavior and prior sleep patterns can be associated with differences in how you respond to trying times is so valuable (more on this to follow). Building those good behaviors ahead of time can be really helpful for acute times when you are not able to achieve them.
And then the last thing, Part 3, for people who are in a position where they have a mental health condition or a sleep condition, there are different types of effective treatments out there. One is cognitive behavioral therapies, which for people who have depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, have shown efficacy in helping to treat those in the long term. They can also in some cases reduce insomnia symptoms, even if not specifically designed for that.",5/20/22
why-sleep-is-crucial-for-mental-health,Why Sleep is Crucial for Your Mental Health,"Sleep Deprivation and Mental Health
How does not getting enough sleep negatively affect our mental health?
MC: Insufficient sleep is certainly associated with adverse mental health symptoms, and then also a dysregulation of functional brain activity that’s going on during sleep.
When we miss out on sleep, the amygdala, which is a part of the brain involved in emotional reactions, goes into overdrive. In fact, there was a study using MRI brain scans that found the amygdala was around 60% more emotionally reactive in participants who were in a state of acute sleep deprivation compared to people who were sleeping normally and well rested. So, when you’re short on sleep, your ability to respond to potentially emotionally intensive events is compromised.
And, what’s worse is that heightened emotional reactivity related to amygdala hyperactivity is paired with dysregulation of another brain area called the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in decision making. And so not only do you have an overactive amygdala, which is making you more emotionally reactive, but also the prefrontal cortex is less able to integrate that information and control impulses.
What about naps? Do you think they are beneficial for your mental health?
MC: Naps are always somewhat of a controversial topic. I think a lot of it comes down to a balance between what’s physiologically beneficial versus maladaptive. It can definitely provide positive mental effects, reducing stress, decreasing the risk of cognitive dysfunction, improving memory retention, and specifically helping with retention of episodic memory.

In addition to treating the core challenge, you can improve health overall too.
Three things everyone should keep in mind regarding sleep and mental health.
What happens during sleep that is so critical for our mental health?
MC: A key aspect is really the consolidation of memories and emotional processing. During the day we have the “acquisition phase” of building memories, and then at night we consolidate a lot of those memories into storage.
Much of that processing happens during REM sleep. We process a lot of the emotional memories during healthy REM sleep, which is something that can become dysregulated in the presence of a mental health condition. For someone with depression, one leading hypothesis is that there’s an abnormal pattern of emotional processing during REM sleep.",5/20/22

I’m not the kind of designer you would hire to design artwork for a CD cover, or the next movie poster.

why-you-should-work-out-during-your-period,Why You Should Work Out During Your Period,"Working out during your period may seem like a non-starter for some of us. We’d rather lie on the couch with a heating pad, but exercising may just be the best thing you can do to relieve the worst of your symptoms.
## Benefits Of Exercising On Your Period
First off, the endorphins your body releases during exercise help reduce your perception of pain and trigger positive feelings. If you usually feel down or suffer from menstrual cramps, working out can reduce cramping and boost your mood. Aerobic activity before your period can relieve PMS symptoms in the same way.
Secondly, you can gain more muscle during your period than at any other phase of your cycle, according to Dr. Stacy Sims, who collaborated with the WHOOP data science team on a study that uncovered key differences between natural menstrual cycles and hormonal birth controlled menstrual cycles.
“Physiologically, your body is primed to hit it hard,” Dr. Sims said during a recent AMA with WHOOP members. Sims added that it was a myth that you shouldn’t work out during their periods.
WHOOP research found that in naturally cycling individuals (not using hormonal birth control), heart rate variability (HRV) and recovery are elevated in the early and mid-follicular phases. During this phase, estrogen levels are low. High estrogen levels increase vagal activity and decrease sympathetic activity, but low levels mean these systems are more prepared for fight or flight instead of pregnancy.
Your body is resilient to stress during your period, so you can work out harder while having better recoveries the next day. During the follicular stage (starting with your period and ending with ovulation) your body can better access carbohydrates from your diet, your HRV is generally higher and you can get more REM and deep sleep. This all adds up to stronger recoveries and the ability to perform the next day.
This chart shows the phases of a normal menstrual cycle.",1/12/22
why-you-should-work-out-during-your-period,Why You Should Work Out During Your Period,"The Best Time to Train Hard and Get Results
Your period is the ideal time to get aggressive with your workouts and strength training. Try high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or plyometrics. Stack on the weights and do heavy resistance anaerobic training.
If your period symptoms hinder you from training, listen to your body, but, you should still try to get some exercise in, even if it’s short.
“Try a few short bursts of sprint interval training,” Dr. Sims suggests. “Something like 20 seconds all out 5-8 times with 2 minutes’ cruise between, then call it. The super-intense work will increase post-exercise anti-inflammatory responses, release endorphins, and because it is short, it is not as taxing mentally or physically as doing a full structured workout.”
But if you’re afraid of trying training based on what you’ve been told in the past about periods, Dr. Sims says to ignore the misconceptions and look at the latest science.
“Don’t let the myths get to you! If you feel like hitting it hard, go for it! Your body can handle it and your training potential will thank you.”

will-baseballs-disabled-list-now-be-used-for-injury-prevention,Will Baseball's Disabled List Now Be Used for Injury Prevention?,"Major League Baseball and the MLB Players Association renegotiated their collective bargaining agreement this past offseason. One of the notable rule changes revolves around the length of time injured players are held out of action.
Previously, the minimum number of days that a player had to spend on the disabled list (DL) was 15 (excluding the special 7-day DL used only for concussions). Under the league’s new labor deal, there is now a 10-day DL.
This change was instituted to protect players, while also allowing teams to have more roster flexibility.
In past years, a team might hesitate to put a player with a minor injury on the disabled list if he was likely to be healthy in less than 15 days. Instead, the club would play shorthanded for a few games while anticipating his return the lineup. During that time, there could be pressure on the player to take the field before he was ready. Now, if a player is expected to be out for a week (7-10 days is a common diagnosis for many nagging injuries) it’s less of a gamble for his team to add him to the 10-day DL and replace his position on the roster.
Paul Swydan of Fangraphs took an in-depth look at how MLB franchises can benefit from the shorter disabled list, particularly in regards to starting pitchers. He cited an example from last August, when Red Sox pitcher Eduardo Rodriguez pulled his hamstring during a game against the Orioles:
“Rodriguez was firing on all cylinders. In his first four innings in Baltimore, he pitched no-hit ball, walking just [one] while striking out seven. He struck out [the side] in order in the fourth. When he came out in the fifth inning, however, he tweaked his hamstring. He left in the middle of his at-bat against Steve Pearce and wouldn’t pitch for 12 days. Rodriguez spent those 12 days on the active roster, because at the time, the team was hopeful he would make his next start.”",5/3/17

Now, assuming there’s a day off in the schedule (normal for a 10-day span), teams can put a starting pitcher on the disabled list and have him miss only one turn in the rotation.
The Ringer’s Ben Lindbergh recently examined whether or not clubs have been taking advantage of the new DL this year:
“Naturally, one would expect shorter DL stints to lead to more DL stints. … 158 players had been placed on the 10-day DL through this April 25; through the same date last season, 140 players had been placed on the 15-day DL. … In other words, DL activity has increased, albeit not by so much that the sport has functioned in a dramatically different way.”
Lindbergh speculates that this may change when players are in greater need of rest as the season progresses:
“If we do see stretching of what constitutes an ‘injury,’ some of it will likely be done in the name of preventing fatigue. ‘Fatigue’ needn’t be a BS justification for a DL stint; as former Dodgers head athletic trainer and VP of medical services Stan Conte says, ‘Many people think the 10-day DL will be [used] to rest players with the idea that this will reduce injuries overall, since many of us think fatigue is a cause of injuries. This is especially [true] for starting pitchers.’ … However, since we haven’t hit May yet, it’s too soon for fatigue to be a big problem (or a convincing fake one).”
Rather than for recuperating from injuries, could the disabled list now be used as a method of injury prevention?
In a study conducted by WHOOP and Major League Baseball in 2016, players were found to have diminishing daily Recoveries preceding injuries. Will teams use this knowledge to their advantage in 2017?",5/3/17

Women have unique physiological needs but haven’t always had access to individualized guidance to unlock their full potential. We don’t all need 10,000 steps a day or exactly 8 hours of sleep a night. Women have different cycle lengths, various journeys with pregnancy, and distinct experiences across many dimensions of fitness, health, relationships, work, and more.
We all have unique physiological needs which require a personalized approach to fitness and health, but existing technology and coaching often provide generic recommendations that aren’t designed to help us truly optimize our performance.
## Performance is Personal
Recent surveys of WHOOP members found that 30% of respondents do not feel comfortable talking about pregnancy with friends, and 45% are not comfortable discussing menopause. Additionally, 69% said they’ve never been educated on how to sleep, train, or fuel based on stages of their menstrual cycle.
This is why WHOOP continues to invest in the science, product features, and conversations to better help women understand their physiology.

work-out-frequency-strain-coach,How Often Should You Work Out? The WHOOP Strain Coach Can Help,"Know How Much to Exercise & Avoid Overtraining: WHOOP Strain Target
WHOOP acts like a 24/7 coach right on your wrist. Every morning, the Strain Target gives you exertion-level recommendations based on your daily recovery. It updates as your body takes on strain throughout the day, continually advising you on how much more is needed to get to your ideal total.
When you’re ready to work out, you can open the Strain Target and see a suggested amount of strain for that particular activity. This amount can be adjusted based on your intended outcome.
Do you want to push yourself past what your body can readily handle (overreaching) to work on improving your fitness? Or, maybe you’d like to stay below your optimal zone to help boost recovery (restorative)?
While you’re exercising, the Strain Target tracks your average heart rate, max heart rate, calories burned, and which heart rate zone you’re in at any given time. As your strain builds, it lets you know when you’ve reached the desired goal for that activity. With Strength Trainer, WHOOP can also track the muscular load of your workout which gets factored into your overall Strain score.
Monitoring your exertion with the WHOOP Strain Target allows you to better determine how often you should work out.
For example, if your body is poorly recovered and you’ve already accumulated strain from regular daily activities, maybe you’ve reached your optimal amount for the day and it’s better to skip your evening workout. Or, on the other hand, if you woke up in the green and only got in a light session this morning, maybe it’s a good day to exercise twice. Either way, the Strain Target tracks the impact of your workouts and enables you to make more informed decisions.

work-out-frequency-strain-coach,How Often Should You Work Out? The WHOOP Strain Coach Can Help,"## How Often Should You Exercise?
The question of how frequently to work out depends on who you are and what goals you have. Things like age, fitness level, and the intensity and duration of your exercise all come into play, as does what you’re trying to accomplish. Are you training for a specific event? Looking to lose weight? Build muscle? Or maybe just hoping to stay healthy and in shape?
Each person is unique, so the more you can learn about yourself the better you’ll be able to answer this question.
## Factors That Affect How Often to Work Out
Physiology: A young, physically fit person is likely better suited to exercise more often than someone who is older and out of shape. But, even for you specifically, there are some days when your body is more prepared to handle workouts than others.
Intensity: Generally speaking, the harder you exercise, the less capable your body is to work out as frequently, and visa versa.
Duration: Similar to intensity, working out for longer periods of time also reduces your body’s ability to do so with more regularity.
Goals: If you’re trying to do anything that requires making fitness gains, you’ll want to exercise more often than if you’re simply aiming to maintain your current level of fitness.
## Is It OK to Work Out Everyday?
The simple answer is “yes,” engaging in physical activity on a daily basis is a healthy behavior. However, it’s important to find the right balance of exercise intensity and duration so that you don’t push yourself too hard (this can lead to Overtraining Syndrome, a common pitfall for many athletes).
As mentioned above, no matter who you are or what you do, sometimes your body is ready to crush a workout and sometimes it’s not. How do you know? Based on your physiological markers, the WHOOP recovery metric provides daily insight (from 0-100% and classified as green, yellow or red) as to how prepared your body is to perform.",11/13/20
work-out-frequency-strain-coach,How Often Should You Work Out? The WHOOP Strain Coach Can Help,"How Long Should You Work Out For?
This may depend on the type of exercise you’re doing and how much stress you want to put on your body. WHOOP quantifies the strain (an individualized measure of cardiovascular and muscular load on a 0-21 scale) your body takes on, both for specific workouts and activities, and over the course of your entire day.
Different kinds of workouts naturally vary in intensity, and in turn put different amounts of strain on your body. For example, let’s say your goal was to hit a strain of 10 (considered moderate) for a specific workout. Below are the most common activities logged in the WHOOP app, and the average length of time it takes for people to reach a 10 strain while participating in each.
The average numbers of minutes it takes WHOOP members to achieve a 10 strain during popular methods of exercise.
Using the above chart as a guide, one might conclude that on average swimming or cycling for 50 minutes has roughly the same cardiovascular affect on your body as about 30 minutes of running (it’s worth pointing out people do take breaks when exercising, likely more regularly in swimming than cycling or running).
The key to all of this is that workout frequency and duration can fluctuate significantly, as long as you manage your strain appropriately.",11/13/20
workout-at-night-better,Four Easy Steps to Boost Your Night-Time Workout,"If you’re anything like me, working out at the end of your day seems a lot tougher than at the beginning. That’s because, by the time 5 o’clock rolls around, I’m tired–maybe even stressed from work, and my motivation is harder to muster. Not to mention, evening workouts can wreak havoc on sleep.
However, despite all this, late-in-the-day exercise often can’t be avoided. Whether it’s a scheduling issue or you’re doubling down on your training, knowing how to fuel your night-time workouts will give you the energy you need to attack them head-on, and ensure you still get a good night’s sleep.
Thankfully, through years of self-experimentation and personalized insights from WHOOP, I’ve narrowed the evening workout fueling strategy down to my four-point plan below:
## Fuel up before working out at night
When was your last meal? The biggest challenges with training after a long work day, or anytime after dark, is that it’s usually been 4 or more hours since your last full meal. You need to top-up your tank before you go out training with something that will satiate you, but not make you feel bloated. Ideally you should have your pre-workout fuel about one hour before exercising at night.
Low-carb bars are great options to tide you over without worrying about a late-night sugar buzz (and dreaded crash). If you want a bit more of a boost, try a recovery shake. They can be great carb/protein options that are easy to digest and perfect pre-workout. I also recommend possibly boosting it with a scoop of collagen, which is best absorbed when taken about 45 minutes prior to exercise.

workout-at-night-better,Four Easy Steps to Boost Your Night-Time Workout,"Replace the caffeine with amino acids
Caffeine is a popular performance enhancer for athletes with a proven track record for reducing fatigue and increasing muscular strength. Unfortunately caffeine has a half-life of 5 hours, and if consumed within 6-8 hours of bedtime it can disrupt even the best of sleepers.
A good backup option is amino acids. Studies indicate that ingestion of BCAA (branched chain amino acids) reduces the perceived exertion and mental fatigue during exercise. Plus, they set you up for locking in your performance gains.
## Hydrate with More calories than usual
I find that evening workouts, especially high-intensity training, can have me fading hard halfway through and unable to reach my WHOOP strain goal. For this reason, I prefer to move from my normal low-calorie hydration to a slightly higher-calorie option (more sugar). The extra sugar gives me the kick I need to finish my workouts at night strong.",10/30/20
workout-at-night-better,Four Easy Steps to Boost Your Night-Time Workout,"Get to sleep post-workout & keep your recovery high
Once your workout is complete, it’s probably time for dinner and then bed. If you struggle to wind down and fall asleep like I do, then you may want to try either a Melatonin-focused supplement, or a high-dose CBD supplement to switch your nervous system from “fight or flight” into “rest and relax.”
My favorite post-workout melatonin product is Elite Sleep from Momentous. One thing I really like about it is that it also provides you with a healthy dose of magnesium. Magnesium can be helpful to calm overactive muscles, which is often a big culprit in preventing sleep after evening workouts.
Many WHOOP members use the Journal Feature to track the impact CBD has on their sleep and other metrics. For me personally, it definitely helps!
And there you have it, an easy four-step plan for powerful evening workouts. I hope you find these tips as helpful as I do. By planning correctly, you should be able to keep your night-time training at a high strain without impacting your next-day recovery.

While recent studies encourage women to continue exercise during pregnancy with proper attention to risk and surveillance, there is still a lack of scientific research in the field. This is largely due to the fact that studying pregnant women with invasive technologies can pose risk factors to the woman and fetus.
However, a recent study led by West Virginia University School of Medicine using WHOOP devices sought to change that. The study, spearheaded by Dr. Shon Rowan, an associate professor of WVU, and Karen Merryman, a nurse and IVF coordinator with the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, followed 12 women from conception to birth and monitored their physiological data with WHOOP.",1/29/21
wvu-study-pregnancy-health-trends,WVU School of Medicine Study Uses WHOOP to Track Health Trends of Pregnant Women,"Pregnancy Doesn’t Have to Mean Loss of Fitness
The study consisted of women who were already active so that they were not introducing exercise during the course of pregnancy. “By enrolling women who exercise, we made the variable pregnancy as opposed to enrolling pregnant women and then adding exercise,” said Dr. Rowan.
Preliminary results from all 12 women showed a telling narrative of health and fitness each trimester. On average, participants’ HRV (heart rate variability) declined each trimester, while resting heart rate (RHR) increased. During pregnancy, we know that cardiac output (the amount of blood pumped to the heart) can increase from 30 to 50%. This causes an increase in RHR, and simultaneously a decrease in HRV as a result of shifts in autonomic control, which can make exercise feel more challenging during this time.
However, just because exercise might feel more challenging during each trimester doesn’t mean that it is physically detrimental.
“Many female athletes are concerned about the progress or lack thereof of their fitness journey during pregnancy,” said Jenna Wallace, WVU pediatric psychologist and member of the research team. “The data we are gathering can help obstetricians to encourage and guide their pregnant patients and also to provide peace of mind to female athletes who prioritize the well-being of their babies during this important stage of life.”
What was most intriguing was what happened immediately after the women in the study delivered their babies. HRV shot up and stayed elevated throughout the six-week postpartum period, and even after those six weeks. Additionally, RHR declined after giving birth and continued to improve six-weeks postpartum. Participants’ RHR was actually better than it was pre-pregnancy during this time. These physiological indicators of health and fitness show how pregnancy and delivery can improve overall health.",1/29/21
wvu-study-pregnancy-health-trends,WVU School of Medicine Study Uses WHOOP to Track Health Trends of Pregnant Women,"Helping Pregnant Women Stay Healthy Through Continuous Monitoring
“At WHOOP, we work with some of the best athletes in the world, and we’re constantly pushing the boundaries of human performance,” said Kristen Holmes, our VP of Performance who helped facilitate this study. “At the same time, our goal is to help people of all backgrounds monitor their health so they can understand the physiological changes in their body and see how it impacts their daily lives.”
By using a non-invasive tool like WHOOP to monitor critical data points, including heart rate, HRV, sleep, recovery, and strain, researchers can learn an incredible amount of information about a woman’s health, which in turn helps support the health of the fetus. In addition, WHOOP insights reinforce the notion that a healthy pregnancy is not one-size-fits-all, especially when it comes to exercise. Every woman’s body is different, and WHOOP can help ameliorate risk factors and conflicting medical advice.
Rowan is confident that the analysis from this study could lead to additional research into the topic. The lack of literature available means that there is huge potential for future studies. For example, studying sedentary women who take up exercise during pregnancy.
As WVU continues to analyze data and wait for 3 more women to conceive, they plan to publish the study later this year. WHOOP is honored to be chosen as the wearable device in this study and committed to additional research in the field.
For more information, you can read the full article from WVA here or read the full paper on the study. Stay tuned for additional research in women’s performance that will serve to help WHOOP Members and the community at large.

The WHOOP Journal is the best way to record how your diet may be affecting your performance and recovery. By conducting your own self-study, you can infer which behaviors are impacting your data, including selections such as meat-based diet, plant-based diet, paleo diet, supplements, and more.

5. How much of a jump in respiratory rate from night to night is concerning? – @cdissins
This depends on how much variability is normal for you. The more static your respiratory rate is, the smaller a jump you would need to determine that something meaningful happened. Most people vary by less than 1 rpm from night to night, so seeing an increase of 2 or 3 is typically meaningful. Going 3 rpm above normal could be cause for concern. WHOOP VP of Data Science Emily Capodilupo has written about the concerns associated with elevated respiratory rate amidst the coronavirus pandemic.
6. Does respiratory rate data help identify other illnesses, apart from Covid? e.g. worsening asthma? – @craigiboywonder
While there is a link between respiratory rate and COVID-19, WHOOP cannot conclusively prove that you have contracted the disease, along with other illnesses. Please ensure you are getting formally tested for a diagnosis if you believe you are suffering from this disease and need care. What WHOOP can do is tell you when you’ve deviated from your baseline, which is critical when monitoring your health, and may help you pick up on symptoms or illness before it gets worse.
It is true that changes in respiratory rate have been proven to correlate to other behaviors or physiological interruptions. Examples include:
• Air travel
• Transitioning from low altitude to high altitude
• Alcohol consumption
• Sleep apnea
• Asthma
• Fever",4/10/20
your-top-questions-answered,What our Members Want to Know About WHOOP,"WHOOP Strain
7. Is higher strain always better for any fitness goal? (losing weight vs gaining strength, etc.) – @shak_inabow
As a simple rule, more cardiovascular strain will result in more calories burned, therefore it may be helpful in managing food intake and weight loss. However, higher strain is not always the goal if you are trying to improve fitness. If you are consistently exerting high strain days and not allowing room for recovery, you will not make the same fitness gains if you were to take a day of active rest. The goal with WHOOP strain is to balance it with your recovery days, so you know when to rest and when to push. This is why WHOOP developed the Strain Target.
8. How does daily strain take “heavy lifting” sessions into account? – @cncoachday
WHOOP measures strain based on cardiovascular output and time spent in various heart rate zones. Therefore, if you’re doing a strength-based workout with minimal reps and periods of rest (such as Olympic weightlifting), you will have a lower strain if your heart rate is not elevated for extended periods of time. Many WHOOP members have wondered how their data will reflect a strenuous strength session, so here’s the breakdown:
• Increasing weight and adding new strength exercises to your routine will likely cause soreness and muscle fatigue, otherwise known as delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS). This microtrauma from eccentric lengthening of the muscle fibers typically causes a reduction of HRV the following morning, especially if your body is not used to this kind of stressor.
• Fatigued muscles often result in a higher strain the next day, because your body is working harder to recover as it responds to disturbances of your homeostatic state.
In order to read true muscle breakdown following a workout, you’d need additional tools such as an EMG or blood test.
9. Why do I already have day strain when I wake up? – @issywatson",4/10/20
your-top-questions-answered,What our Members Want to Know About WHOOP,"Your WHOOP cycle begins when you fall asleep, then resets the next time you fall asleep (some other wearables operate on a fixed 24 hour cycle, which isn’t an accurate portrayal of your body’s routine). Therefore, you’ll wake up with a relatively low strain, since your body is still using energy and burning calories while you’re asleep.

The Strain Target gives you an exertion level recommendation based on your recovery (a daily metric for how ready your body is to take on strain) and strain you’ve already accumulated. Strain Target is personalized to your baseline, and constantly adjusts to your daily output. When you start an activity, it shows your strain building in real time towards the suggested goal. You can also see how many calories you’re burning and which heart rate zone you’re operating in.",4/10/20

your-top-questions-answered,What our Members Want to Know About WHOOP,"HRV & Recovery
1. What does it mean if both heart rate variability (HRV) and resting heart rate (RHR) are decreasing over time? – @gavinkerr95
Without knowing your full physiological profile, WHOOP can’t make a completely accurate assessment. However, according to WHOOP VP of Performance Science Kristen Holmes, if you’re a high-level athlete this could be an indicator of “parasympathetic saturation.” In other words, your body is actually recovering well over time as your fitness increases (hence the lower RHR), despite a lower HRV. When it comes time to taper and lay off the training, you may see your HRV increase as you prepare for a race, competition, etc.
2. How does stress correlate with HRV? – @wbrookes8
Stress can have a huge impact on HRV. While stress is the body’s natural response to various external and internal influences and is not always a bad thing, chronic stress or severe anxiety can negatively impact the body’s autonomic nervous system. Studies show that negative emotional states can impact heart rate and heart rate variability, which in turn can affect your cardiovascular health and immune system.
3. How is my recovery so high when I still feel so sore? – @valerie_bedrock
One philosophy of WHOOP is focusing on your body’s physiological data, rather than focusing on how you feel. Oftentimes we feel tired, sore, or unmotivated. However, our internal physiology might be telling a different story.",4/10/20

11. Is WHOOP only for intense athletes? Would it be beneficial for a person who doesn’t workout? – @sam_werner5
WHOOP is for anyone looking to make improvements in their daily performance, whether they are an athlete, a doctor, a parent, a business owner, or more. Monitoring your health via data insights is critical if you want to stay aware, prevent illness and overtraining, and customize your lifestyle behaviors to optimize performance.
12. What makes WHOOP a better choice than other wearables like Apple Watch or Oura Ring? – @decker_saquan
• Overall Accuracy: WHOOP is currently the only wearable that has validated respiratory rate from a 3rd party, verifying its accuracy. This study also said WHOOP was “excellent” when compared to the gold-standard of sleep tracking.

• Hardware: Unlike the Apple Watch, WHOOP keeps a low profile so as not to distract you with notifications and alerts. We intentionally do not have a watch face, so you can go about your day as WHOOP collects 24/7 data in the background.

your-top-questions-answered,What our Members Want to Know About WHOOP,"According to WHOOP VP of Performance Science Kristen Holmes, HRV (the leading component of WHOOP recovery) is affected by the presence of inflammation, not necessarily soreness. If your body is managing inflammation well, HRV will not be as profoundly influenced. If you’ve endured a tough weightlifting session and are still sore, your body’s working overtime to repair, recover, and get stronger. This leads to muscle growth, fat loss, improved cardiovascular health, and overall healthier bodies. Make sure you are allowing time for the body to heal and repair before stressing it all over again, or your body will not be able to recover as quickly the next time.
4. How come my recoveries have been low despite getting good sleep? – @sweets2318
WHOOP recovery is based on 3 metrics: sleep performance, resting heart rate, and heart rate variability. While you may be getting good sleep, what do your other metrics look like compared to your baseline? Getting enough sleep and getting quality sleep are always important and will aid in your recovery, but there may be other factors at play keeping your body from fully recovering the next day.",4/10/20

• HRV Sampling & Patented Algorithm: WHOOP HRV has also been validated within the same sleep study proving its accuracy. Unlike Apple, which pulls raw HRV numbers at random times during the day, WHOOP pulls HRV consistently every night during the last cycle of your deep sleep. This ensures a controlled reading that limits external influences. HRV fluctuates throughout the day based on many factors, so Apple’s reading is not meaningful over time. Additionally, WHOOP HRV is a patented, proprietary algorithm, which means no one else on the market uses it or has access to it.
